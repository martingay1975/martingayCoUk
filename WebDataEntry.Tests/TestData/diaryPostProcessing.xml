    <info>
		<p>Moved to Walton on Thames because Dawesmere Close was not completed. We borrowed a house from a couple who were away touring.</p><p>The house was heated by coal! So mum, inexperienced in coal fires had to learn quick. Life was pretty solitary since having a baby in a new area in winter with Dad at work meant a lonely time.</p>

		<woops rating="5" woopstitle="Plane Crash"><p>I had spent most of the summer in the garage building a radio controlled plane.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1994_08_XX-01-RadioControlledPlane.jpg</src><caption>Plane before the crash</caption></image><p>I saved up for ages, went to Sandown Park with Bazza to buy a kit and kind of struggled through building the plane. The build quality was pretty low.</p><p>Anyway it came to the grand launch day and Dad, Bazza and I ventured over to Pirbright, where others fly, to set my bird free!!! It was a disaster. We umm'ed and arrr'ed how to launch her. By throwing her, or with a proper take off. I decided to do a takeoff from the ground, because if it didn't fly from a throw, then it would just smash into pieces. The moment was set. I gave her some throttle, she began to move and then..... perdunkkk! The nose dived whilst taxiing, buried itself into the ground. The propeller hit the ground as well and ripped the nose clean off. Disaster. Dad was not impressed and was in no mood for laughing! Bazza was on the other hand was wetting himself, but trying to keep it in. I saw Bazza which made me laugh and cry at the same time. Dad just thought I was an idiot I think.</p></woops>

    <title name="martin">Europe Trip - 11 countries in 11 days</title>
    <info>
		<p>Took the overnight sleeper from Copenhagen to Berlin. Very exciting. Woke up in Berlin and from the Zoo station I walked ages following a suggested walk in the book. I reached the Brandenburg gate eventually and saw the Reichstag (Parliament) which seemed to be a part of some art exhibition and had loads of cloth draped over it. I walked on to the East side, went in some shops and went up the tall communications tower which towers above the city. It was pretty cloudy so I didn't see as much as I hoped. I ventured back into the west and eventually went to the Olympic stadium. The one used for the 1938 Olympics. I sat in the VIP seat listening to the World Service. I got back to the station and got the overnight train to Vienna, passing Prague in the middle of the night.</p><p>In Vienna I used the small underground system to get to the famous fairground. This was at the edge of a huge park which I cruised to get to the national football stadium (Swarzenegger stadium).</p><p>From Vienna I again caught the overnight train and passed through the gorgeous Alps down through Italy to Rome and the Vatican.</p><p>Rome was wicked. I remember buying three football shirts for £15. I saw the Coliseum and went to the Vatican. I was refused entry into St Peters because I was wearing shorts on this boiling hot day.</p><p>Again I caught the overnight train to Montpellier, going through the most spectacular costal scenery. Cannes, Monte Carlo, Nice beautiful.</p><p>I stayed with Eva, Frank and Nicholas for a few days, before catching the TGV back to Paris and Eurostar home!</p>
