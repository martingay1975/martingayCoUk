    <info>
		<p>Moved to Walton on Thames because Dawesmere Close was not completed. We borrowed a house from a couple who were away touring.</p><p>The house was heated by coal! So mum, inexperienced in coal fires had to learn quick. Life was pretty solitary since having a baby in a new area in winter with Dad at work meant a lonely time.</p>

The build quality was pretty low.</p><p>Anyway it came to the grand launch day and Dad, Bazza and I ventured over to Pirbright, where others fly, to set my bird free!!! It was a disaster. We umm'ed and arrr'ed how to launch her. By throwing her, or with a proper take off. I decided to do a takeoff from the ground, because if it didn't fly from a throw, then it would just smash into pieces. The moment was set. I gave her some throttle, she began to move and then..... perdunkkk! The nose dived whilst taxiing, buried itself into the ground. The propeller hit the ground as well and ripped the nose clean off. Disaster. Dad was not impressed and was in no mood for laughing! Bazza was on the other hand was wetting himself, but trying to keep it in. I saw Bazza which made me laugh and cry at the same time. Dad just thought I was an idiot I think.</p></woops>

    <title name="martin">Europe Trip - 11 countries in 11 days</title>
    <info>
		<p>Took the overnight sleeper from Copenhagen to Berlin. Very exciting. Woke up in Berlin and from the Zoo station I walked ages following a suggested walk in the book. I reached the Brandenburg gate eventually and saw the Reichstag (Parliament) which seemed to be a part of some art exhibition and had loads of cloth draped over it. I walked on to the East side, went in some shops and went up the tall communications tower which towers above the city. It was pretty cloudy so I didn't see as much as I hoped. I ventured back into the west and eventually went to the Olympic stadium. The one used for the 1938 Olympics. I sat in the VIP seat listening to the World Service. I got back to the station and got the overnight train to Vienna, passing Prague in the middle of the night.</p><p>In Vienna I used the small underground system to get to the famous fairground. This was at the edge of a huge park which I cruised to get to the national football stadium (Swarzenegger stadium).</p><p>From Vienna I again caught the overnight train and passed through the gorgeous Alps down through Italy to Rome and the Vatican.</p><p>Rome was wicked. I remember buying three football shirts for £15. I saw the Coliseum and went to the Vatican. I was refused entry into St Peters because I was wearing shorts on this boiling hot day.</p><p>Again I caught the overnight train to Montpellier, going through the most spectacular costal scenery. Cannes, Monte Carlo, Nice beautiful.</p><p>I stayed with Eva, Frank and Nicholas for a few days, before catching the TGV back to Paris and Eurostar home!</p>

    <info>
		<p>Woke up at 7:45 with my dancing alarm clock. A bit tired, I first have a bath which is cut short with worry if I will pack everything in time.</p><p>Finish packing well within the time for once. As usual I am confident that everything is packed and as usual mum is fussing.</p><p>Caught the 10:44 Farnborough express to arrive in tonnes of time for the 12:27. At Waterloo I try and find something typically English for when I need it much later in the trip. Got the Daily Telegraph also check the exchange rate out.</p><p>Down the escalators to the international station and got confused on what to do. Make final check on tickets and passport. That isn't as easy as it sounds. I am not inter-railing in the traditional sense. Because Dad gets discounts on tickets I have got at least 9 sets of tickets for each leg of my journey. I think normally you'd have one ticket to travel where you like around Europe. All my stops have been planned and booked, so I must catch the right trains.</p><p>Departure lounge is swish and businessy. Loads of Japs there with video cameras and other big boys toys. Get on to the coach first, leave my bags there. They won't get stolen. I walk to the front of the train. There are 25 approximately. coaches. Wow.</p><p>Curse at dad, probably unjustifiably in getting an aisle seat, next to the large window frame. Can't see much very well.</p><p>Young gothic girl, about 20 years old, turns up and sits in the window seat. Not attractive. Dressed all in black. Leaving London the seats behind are free. The coach is only half full. Tell her 'Nothing personal'. Move behind, only to see it is raining outside. Typical. Start reading Theme Park computer game manual.</p><p>The train winds its way for 3 hours to Brussels. I have two hours to kill so decide to go for a walk out of the station. Can't say I am that impressed, although I didn't know where I was going.</p><p>The overnight train from Brussels Midi will take me through Holland and Germany. There were a couple of other blokes who came from Coulsden that were also inter-railing.</p>

Woke in the middle of the night for the Rostock-&gt;Gedser ferry. It was too hot and uncomfortable and I had chronic hayfever. I woke up at 4:40am and then officially at 6am. I waited for the other four to start showing some life before I dared clamber down from the top bunk. I waited until 6:25 and decided to be brave and be the first to move. I went for a wash... well as much as you can in a train toilet. I did not go back in the cabin. I stayed to look at East Germany for the first time ever. It looked a bit ram shackled and untidy, otherwise it was not too bad. I did see a few
        <a href="http://www.trabant.org.uk/">
          'trabies'
        </a>
        abandoned in back gardens. The trabies looked even worse than I can remember. If Dad were here we would be having a good old laugh. Arr the Minder episode where Arthur imports one. Fantastic.
      </p><p>At 6:50am we suddenly hit Berlin. No nice suburbia area, just straight from farmland to an estate of flats. Not very pretty flats at that. The train arrived a few minutes late. I waited for everyone to get out of the cabin so that I could sort my baggage out alone. Thirty seconds later, the SS guard barked at me to get out. Alright calm down I thought. Got out of the train, found a locker for the big red bag and paid my 2DM. Now try and find how to get to the Zoological Garten station so that I can follow the guide in the book.</p><p>My hay fever is really affecting me and my right eye is all red. Not a pretty sight. Have not got a clue where I am going and finally after 30 minutes I go and ask at the info desk for what to do. He points me in the right direction. Buy a ticket for 3.70DM but do not know what that entitles me to.</p><p>Travelling on the S-Bahn westwards I notice that the train doors are not electronic and can be opened at anytime. Also those German do like to graffiti everything within reach. Arrive at the 'Zoo' in the rush hour. A busy place at the best of times anyway. I did not notice the change from east to west Berlin. From Zoo I follow the guide book. I turn left and make my way towards Tiergartenstraße. On the way there are about 20-30 police motorcycles gathered outside a hotel along with 5-6 police vans. Flashing lights and sirens. There escorting somebody important but I don't know who.</p><p>Get to the quieter area near the woodlands (Tiergarten) and eat some of yesterdays sandwiches. Continue another kilometre to Potsdammer Platz which was supposed to be Berlin's Piccadilly Circus before the war. All there is now is just construction sites, a bit disappointing.</p><p>By this time, 9:00am, it is very, very humid. I carry along northwards along 'no man’s land', which is a 75m strip of desolate grassland which is about to be constructed on. Continue to the Brandenburg gate. I have a rest, getting a bit tired and drink and eat some sandwiches. Although there are no gates and no wall to be seen, quite a nice site. To cap it all there was a 'trabi' that stopped underneath the archway. The sad thing was I could not get my camera out in time. Around the Brandenburg gate there were street salesmen selling all sorts of East German memorabilia from bits of wall to the guards hats. Bought a matchbox 'trabie' car for about 5DM.</p><p>After the 'gate' I headed towards the Reichstag, the old parliamentary building. It was very busy there and plenty of TV crews. They were covering it up with a silvery colour cloth to protect it. didn't get to see much of that. Had a look at the market stalls just opposite and saw another matchbox 'trabie' for sale at 10DM! Walked east towards the old Eastern side down Unter Den Linden. This is where dear old Adolf used to have his marches. Again this street is under heavy re-development and so was a bit disappointing. Saw the place where the 'book burning' was done and saw 'Bebel Plate'. I needed another rest and sat down to eat and play on the 'Gameboy'. then it started to rain. This was around midday, 1 o'clock. then it started to thunder and lightning. It sounded like the blitz in Berlin with each roll of thunder.</p><p>I took relief at the strange , Neue Wache for half an hour. Even though it rained hard it dried off just a bit and I decided to walk to 'Platz de Akademe'. Moral was lower, see all those old buildings and it was raining. I decided a change of scenery so went up the telecommunications tower. A massive tower shadowing East Berlin. Went up it costing me 13DM and had an 8DM pot of hot chocolate in spinning cafe. It completes one revolution every half an hour. The problem was that it was very cloudy and I couldn’t see very far. For my £10 pot of hot chocolate I decided to stay for 45 minutes. This tower is situated right next to Alexander Platz.</p><p>At last I found some shops just by the tower. Could I get a bargain at the presumable cheaper German shops. No! CD's were 33DM (£15), computer games 100DM, Trainers and jeans were £20 more expensive. Caps were up to 40DM.</p><p>About 4:00pm now. Got on a crowded bus to 'Zoo'. I almost got away without paying, but an honest chap like myself went and paid the conductor. The traffic was bad and the weather poor. Saw one of the stadiums and 'Siegeßade großer stern'. A large, impressive statue in the middle of a roundabout. Got off at Zoo and made way for the main shopping street, Kurtustendamm. Not very impressed. Decided to go to the Olympic stadium. So went up Knesebeck Straße and get on a train at 'Savigny Platz'.</p><p>
        Finally get to the quiet station of 'Olympia Stadia' and made the five minute walk to the
        <a href="http://www.olympiastadion-berlin.de/">
          Olympic stadium
        </a>
        itself. It looked quite impressive. I paid the 1DM at the gate and went inside. Two light roofs at both sides of the straight, and seating all the way around. I went on to the track and field. Would this be allowed at Wembley? From the hub of the city it was nice to be in the peace and quiet. I sat down in the VIP seats, took my shirt off because of the blazing sun, and listened to the world service on my radio, wrote this and played on the Gameboy. I was there for around two hours I really enjoyed it. I was imagining what the 1936 Olympics would have been like with Hitler there. I had not realized that there was an equestrian and swimming centre within the grounds as well. Walked back to the station and took almost the entire length of the U2 U-Bahn line to AlexanderPlatz. Back at Lichtenberg, where I paid 3DM for a can of coke. I telephoned home to say I was still alive. Waited for 2 hours for my train.
      </p><p>On the train with four other German speaking men and a women. Wear shorts to bed this time. Learnt from Yesterday night. Knackered. Lights out after an hour’s travelling at 11:30pm</p>

		<p>In the afternoon I ventured to the famous Prater fairground and went on the big wheel, the same one as James Bond had done.

It was strange as it seemed circular, rather than oval. I managed to walk right in.</p>

		<p>Arrived in Rome. This was a vibrant, great city. The traffic was mad, topped by the roman driving! Wow. Your car wouldn't survive without dinks here and there.</p><p>I went to the Coliseum and toured inside. It was strange as the floor of the main arena had troughs in it.</p><p>I walked from there to the impressive Victor Emmanuel building.</p><p>I went to the Vatican. I was refused entry into St Peters Basilica.</p><p>I then went in search of the Olympic stadium. I went to try and get in like in Berlin and Vienna. A security guard got very shirty with me. I was resigned to the fact I couldn't get in, and went to their training ground which was close by and sat and had a rest.</p><p>Time was marching on, and I headed back towards the stadium. There were some street stalls where fake, cheap football shirts were sold. I bought three! A great, but warring day.</p>

    <title>Out with Laura</title>
    <info>
		<p>I was out for another night with Stevey, Stevey's girlfriend, Patsy, a wild child American who he was dating, Patsy's mate, Christie, another American and of course Laura who I last saw six months previous at Stevey's family boxing day do, who at the time was going out with Phil Rowe. This must have been the first time that I had gone out, where there were more women than blokes, and come to think about it, Steve and Patsy were a bit involved with each other at the time, so it was a bit like me going out with two girls, both very nice, not the usual quality talent that is associated with me. In fact this was so new to me, it was going to be an experience whatever happened. the venue was Ricks Bar, Bracknell, a pub come club type place, mainly used as a starting place before going into the adjoining Masquerades night club.</p><p>Now you could view this position in a number of ways. The 'blokes' view would be, no problemo, great opportunity to pull, two attractive single, free girls and me who were coerced to talk with each other. My predicted view would be, I've got no chance, I'm not even going to try, I shall sit in the corner. However, this was not my view for the evening.</p><p>I remember the first round of drinks , Steve bought for Patsy and Christie, I think, so a great opportunity to buy Laura a drink. Having bought a lager and bitter and thinking Christie was speaking with her best mate. I thought it a great chance to speak to Laura. Now I know Laura seemed a very outgoing person, which usually scares me, because I'm quiet and boring. However, I was asked about my recent holiday. I was glad to talk about that, it may be a subject that I could actually sound interesting. Ten countries in ten days, explained in 10 minutes. I'd ran out of steam. She seemed to take an interest. I felt so at ease as if we knew each other for a while.</p><p>Then as per norm Steve was all over Patsy which left Christie no other choice but to meander her way between Laura and I. I was disappointed and was sure to blow my 'ease' out of the water. I only wanted one girl around and had negative thoughts to an American who seemed just like another teenage girl. Our discussion revolved around the differences with America. I was hoping to continue the flow of the conversation , but the first seeds of my passion to Laura had been sown. Laura did not seem to have minded this intrusion from the foreigner, not that she should have, but I wish she had shown some visual, down cast feelings. The evening flowed on for about 3 hours I suppose, which I had enjoyed immensely, although a little dejected at the end, but I didn't show what qualities I thought I possessed. We left and dropped the Americans off and then finally myself.</p><p>Laura sailed off with Steve in his mini, whilst I wished she could of cruised with me for a chat and a laugh. I made Laura my most wanted girl. She had made a mark on me. I assumed it would be another six months before I next saw Laura. I did not have the bottle to ask her out because I thought she would think I was just a nice friend of Stevey's and no more. I had heard of the interest from Laura had created amongst blokes in Brighton. The inexperienced me would not have a chance. However, the Alton Towers trip was arranged later, time to gain my bottle. Little had I expected the outcome of that trip, which has led to my extreme happiness.</p>

    <title>Mum and Dad’s - 25th Wedding Anniversary</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mum and Dad's 25th Wedding Anniversary wasn't actually until next week, however, they had arranged a big party at the house. Lise and Jørgen and Mormor were staying over at the time, so it was quite hectic in the days preceding it.</p><p>A barrel of Hogs Back Tea was bought and placed in the marquee that we erected in the back garden. A lot of dad's work friends were there, as well as some family and mum's playschool friends.</p><p>I had invited Steve, Laura and Bazza over. Gary and his parents were also invited. Anyway I got quite drunk... offended Mums friend Suzanne (luckily without her hearing, calling her a big raspberry), and almost put my fist through Steve's car (mini) windscreen when I thought I was giving the car an affection pat goodbye!</p><p>After that performance, goodness knows why I had the confidence to ask Laura out the week after!</p>

    <title>Asking Laura Out</title>
    <info>
		<p>I can't remember quite how it happened, but the fact that Laura travelled back in the car with myself and Patsy from Alton Towers gave me confidence that she was interested in me a little bit. She was great fun to be with.</p><p>For some reason I had enough bottle to want to ask her out. I don't understand if this was confidence or whether I was desperate to continue meeting up. Anyhow, I asked Stevey what I planned to do. He rated my chances of success to be 40 / 60 against. Thanks to my best mate. Thing is I didn't believe I had such bad chances. Perhaps he was trying to protect me.</p><p>I remember I was at work (Armstrong’s, High Wycombe) and waited for a quiet time in the afternoon in the office. I went into the Marketing Director's office (who wasn't there at the time) and phoned Laura up to see if we could go out on a date. I remembered not to do a Rodney and sound all wet and unconfident. Anyway Laura said yes and had agreed to meet up on Friday at her house.</p><p>I was ecstatic. I remember phoning to tell dad straight away. Also I phoned Steve up to give me directions.</p>

    <title>!! First Date !!</title>
    <info>
		<p>Got directions from the dawg Barnett to go and pick Laura up from her house in Istead Rise. First time in Gravesend, so I was totally in Laura's hand as for a place to hang out. She choose the Railway Tavern!!! Mmmm. Still I wasn't there for the surroundings. Can't remember what we talked about, but I know it wouldn't have been easy from both sides. The enthusiasm or connection for each other outweighed any negative thoughts of stilted conversation, or rough surroundings. I believe we ended the night with Laura taking my hand, so although I asked her out, she made the first move on the affection front. We walked down to the river's edge, close to the pub and had a little kiss, before returning Laura on my chariot back to her house. I then made the 70 miles journey back home.</p><p>Going over to see Laura at the weekend was a regular occurrence for about 4 months.</p>

    <title>Grease</title>
    <info>
		<p>As a belated birthday present Laura took me to see Grease at the Dominion theatre. This was the first time I had been to the theatre and I remembered I was absolutely bowled over with the auditorium when I first walked in. I absolutely loved the atmosphere and the whole theatre thing. It was a real show.</p>

    <title>NW Holiday - Driving To Liverpool</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura stayed overnight on the Friday, so we were fresh for a Saturday getaway. We left mid-morning, after spending ages fixing the bikes to Daisy. I drove to Wycombe where I filled with the wrong type of petrol (unleaded instead of 4 star) and we met my old boss from Armstrong days, Patrick Finlay.</p><p>M40, M6 interchange. Get in road rage incident. We got stuck in a traffic jam and the big bloke in front stopped to look at his map in the slow lane when the traffic was moving. So I overtook him and joined the M6. The big bloke then raced up the hard shoulder passing several cars and rejoined the slow lane of the motorway, just in front of us. I was enraged, but kept calm and collected as ever and did not want to ram him up spaghetti junction. Very soon after the car in front stopped again, whilst the other traffic was moving. I got angry and beeped the horn, to which the man opened his door and waved his fists at us. He would have got out of the car, but the traffic had just begun to trundle on again. We passed him 5 minutes later in the traffic where he showed his displeasure at us again</p><woops rating="7" woopstitle="Potential Motorway Pile Up"><p>We stopped at services to stretch our legs. I went to make sure the bikes were secured on the rack at the back of the car and noticed that they were hanging on by a thread. I reckon if we continued down the motorway much longer they would have fallen and be strewn across the carriage way.</p><p>We gave up trying to fix them to the rack as we were too thick to work it out and ended up putting them into the boot of the car with all the luggage.</p></woops><p>We ate lunch in the traffic jam as we were short of time.</p><p>Arrived in Liverpool and started looking for the Albert Docks, but got lost and went under the Mersey which cost us a £1 in toll money. We then had to turn around to come back again from the Wirral</p><p>We eventually found the Albert dock where there was plenty of parking, but we were worried about Daisy and our belongings. Would they still be there when we got back?</p><p>We went around the Beatles Experience which was excellent. Looked around the docks, craft shops and saw the Good Morning weather map</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1996/1996_09_14-LiverpoolDocks.jpg</src><caption>Albert Dock</caption></image><p>We then drove to Anfield and looked around the outside of the stadium and saw the Hillsborough memorial</p><p>Went to find our hotel in Southport, but couldn't find it. So we asked for directions. Found it and it was really nice</p><p>Went out and had some chips by the Southport river. Went for a couple of pints in two nice pubs, before returning back to the Leicester hotel.</p>

    <title>NW Holiday - Manchester and Liverpool</title>
    <info>
		<p>After a nice breakfast, we left our hotel to walk to the station to go to Manchester for the day. Having got to the station we realised we'd forgotten the camera, so we walked back to get it. then halfway back to the station, Laura had to run back again as she left her student rail card.</p><p>Waited ages for the train to leave, then set off to Liverpool. Played whist all the way there. We needed to change to Lime Street and so asked for directions from the guard who drew us a nice map.</p><p>Caught the train to Manchester Victoria, which we wanted to do, as we both studied the line at school. We then waited ages for a tram (metrolink) to Old Trafford.</p><p>Due to all the waiting at the stations, we arrived too late for the booked Manchester United tour, but luckily we booked for one on Friday. After this disappointment, we fare dodged a tram ride to the G-Mex centre and nearly got trapped in a Mind and body Exhibition.</p><p>Walked to Castlefield, where there was a massive fete, next to the canal where we bought some sandwiches and rested for a while.</p><p>We made our way to the nearby museum of Technology, but were too late to get in. we then made a long walk, getting a lost a bit, back to the town hall, then the recently bombed Arndale Centre. We went to the city centre where we walked around Piccadilly Gardens where there was a fairground and lots of homeless people. We couldn't stay there because we didn't want to be too late for the train back to Liverpool, plus we wanted a pint, so we found a pub close to Victoria station which was very cheap.</p><p>We headed back to Lime Street at about 7pm, where we tried to find somewhere to eat, but strangely nowhere offered vegetarian food it seemed. We walked for miles and an our travels passed Nelson's Column, the art gallery and the shopping centre which was very boarded up.</p><p>We gave up and trained it back to Southport, after which Laura was feeling the soothing effects of my foot massage. we bought a special offer '2 for 1' pizza and took them to the inlet by the sea.</p>

    <title>NW Holiday - Bamber Bridge, Malham</title>
    <info>
		<p>After breakfast we packed together our things, paid for the two nights stay and said goodbye to the hotel. Before say goodbye completely to Southport, we thought that we would go and have a look at the sea as we had not seen it yet. However, it was a long walk, as the sand seemed to go on forever. The further we got the more we sank into what had become more like mud! We did not get in much further before the lifeguard blew his whistle at us because we were out of bounds and ignored the red danger flags!!</p><p>Leeds was our next destination. However, inevitably as it was to turn out, we got lost, and ended up near Bamber Bridge, which was good for me because I managed to get a tour of the football ground by a couple of their officials. They were very friendly people and recommended us some places in the lake district to visit.</p><p>We continued on our way to Leeds. I was driving and accidentally put Daisy into reverse going down a hill!! I was trying to find neutral, to roll down the hill to save petrol, but pushed the gear lever 1 notch too many!!! The car wouldn't start after this, so we had to find a garage. The first one we found wanted £100 to tow her, but the second garage came out and fixed her for free. We drove onto Blackburn and stopped in a nice pub by the canal to celebrate how lucky we'd been!!!</p><p>After a lovely drink, we got back in Daisy ready to try to get to Leeds again. I think we were destined never to get there because she wouldn't start again. We decided to for a walk along the canal to see if she would work after a rest, but she didn't. So again we were left looking for a garage. I found a right dodgy place, and didn't want to interrupt the boss man who seemed a bit underground to me. Anyway they came out in their van and they started Daisy straight away and told us that she needed lots of petrol, so we filled her up at the next petrol station, and headed off for the fourth time towards Leeds.</p><p>We drove through some lovely Pennine villages. When we got to Halifax we thought that Leeds was now out of the question. We just didn't have enough time. After lots of 'Norman bad map reading', we got to Malham Scar, and on the way back saw Janet's Foss, which is a nice waterfall. Malham has special memories for me as I came here on a school trip with the last year of Ravenscote.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1996/1996_09_16-NorthernHoliday-MalhamCove-MartinLaura.jpg</src><caption>Malham Cove</caption></image><p>We had a really nice meal in a lovely restaurant and then drove eerily through the Yorkshire Dales in the dark to the remote village of Litton. We were staying at the lovely Queens Arms Inn, so we had a pint or two before retiring to the most gorgeous bedroom with lovely beams on the ceiling. A place I'd love to return to.</p>

    <title>NW Holiday - Kendal, Windermere, Keswick</title>
    <info>
		<p>Had a top notch fried breakfast before setting out through the Dales on the way to Kendal. Laura was in search for her 'mint cake' in a town spoilt by the traffic. We bought postcards and some beer for our dads. Laura left her footprint in some wet cement in the high street. We got our photo taken by a real northern speaking man! After Kendal we drove to Windermere</p><p>We found the guest house we were staying in tomorrow and tried to ask whether we could leave our stuff there. However, no one was in. We left Daisy there and started to cycle towards Keswick where we were going to stay that night. After about 10 minutes we realised that we'd left the camera behind so I cycled back to get it! We set off again, stopping to look at all the lakes and gorgeous scenery on the way. We ate some rolls by lake Windermere for lunch. The cycle ride was really nice, except for when Laura decided she couldn't go up the slightest of inclines. We were in the lake district cycling, and now Laura tells me she doesn't like going up hills. Her bike was Charlotte's little kiddy bike. Prêt a manger!!</p><p>On the way to Keswick we took a d-tour past the 'circle of stones' where two people were doing some very strange dance exercises which we found very amusing. We made up from our earlier stresses from the hills!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1996/1996_09_17-NorthernHoliday-OnTheWayToKeswick.jpg</src><caption>Martin posing in front of Windermere Lake</caption></image><p>Got to our next hotel just a little tired after a mere 25 mile cycle (and walk!!) We felt completely exhausted and so we went to a pub and had a big meal and a few pints.</p><p>We had a really nice sleep!!</p>

    <title>NW Holiday - The mountain incident</title>
    <info>
		<p>Wednesday was a disaster day (what another one!). From the moment we set off. We went to buy some rolls for lunch and when we tried to lock the bikes up we couldn't find the keys! We realised we could have lost them absolutely anywhere and Daisy's key was with them. Luckily we tried last night’s pub first, and they were there.</p><p>We first went to the Cumberland pencil museum and got a free graphite pencil and watched a video on how they are made! Highlight.</p><woops rating="9" woopstitle="Potentially Stuck On Remote Mountain"><p>Our plan was to cycle back to Windermere from Keswick, roughly 22 miles away which is where the car was based. We decided to go cross country a bit as we had been along the roads the previous day. Because Windermere was further south on the map (meaning further down), Laura thought this meant it was going to be downhill!!! I know shocking.</p><p>Anyway without surveying the map properly I decided we should take a short cut through the Borrowdale Valley following Langstreth Beck, to the south of Stonethwaite, and cut across east to the south of Lake Thrillmere, a mere 600 metres high.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1996/1996_09_18-NorthernHoliday-Mountain-04-Laura.jpg</src><caption>The mountain where we got stuck at</caption></image><p>It started off OK, but began to get harder taking the bikes up, soon it became too steep for Laura to wheel her bike up, so I did both. Then it became too steep to wheel the bikes, so I carried Laura's up on my shoulders for about 10 or 15 metres, then came back down to fetch mine and do the same. This was really tiring work for me, and eventually it got too steep to get the bikes up small vertical ledges. We decided it would be a good time to stop and have some lunch and recharge the batteries. As you can imagine there was a wonderful, peaceful view.</p><p>The weather turned on us, and it began to drizzle with rain. At this point I was a bit worried. We slid down the hill, sometimes uncontrollably, with the bikes to end up where we had started, but a few hours on. We hadn't appreciated that we were at the Heart of the Lake District and the fact that there were some serious inclines which should only be tackled by those prepared and experienced!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1996/1996_09_18-NorthernHoliday-Mountain-10-Martin.jpg</src><caption>The mountain where we got stuck at</caption></image><p>We made it to the road and began to head south, towards grange. Having looked at a map there we knew this road was not going to lead us to Windermere. The only way to go was back to Keswick. By the time we got back it was late afternoon, and we knew we didn't have much chance of making it back before night fall, and we were knackered. So the only solution, was to lock the bikes up, catch a bus to Windermere, drive back to Keswick to pick up the bikes, then return in the car to Windermere where we turned in for the night. What a day!!</p></woops>

    <title>NW Holiday - On to Blackpool</title>
    <info>
		<p>Firstly we went round the Beatrix Potter museum which was excellent. We had a cup of tea and a cake in the coffee shop there. Then we went to a jumper making place and I bought a green middle aged spread jumper. Probably the worst buy ever!</p><p>We drove through Hawkeshead and stopped for a walk round Coniston village before we left the lake district to drive to Blackpool.</p><p>Blackpool was excellent. The lift up the tower was shut so we could not go up there. First we looked for a hotel and we found one and paid for it and afterwards we found a 'proper' hotel not a guest house and it was really cheap, but our one was still lovely. Very Pink.</p><p>We looked around the amusements. I won a whale for Laura in a darts game. We played air-hockey and had a go on the motor-bikes arcade game. We went on a runaway mine train. We then walked along the pier and had our photograph taken on it. We then walked back to our hotel.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1996/1996_09_19a-NorthernHoliday-BlackpoolPier-MartinLaura.jpg</src><caption>Paris??</caption></image><p>We got ready for a night out in Blackpool. It was our 'one year' anniversary celebration evening and our last night, so it was going to be very special.</p><p>We went for a drink and put our favourite songs on the jukebox. We found a lovely Italian restaurant. The meal was really nice. we walked along the 'Golden Mile' towards Pleasure Land, so we could go on the Pepsi Max ride. We caught the tram some of the way - the trams were all lit up. The ride was shut because of the wind! So we walked back, getting our photo taken by a transvestite and outside the tower which was all lit up. When we got back to the hotel we finished a lovely evening with a bottle of champagne and drunk it out of the hotel mugs!!</p>

		<p>Mum and Dad had got me a fabulous driving day at Thruxton for my 21st birthday. I was a little nervous and didn't do that well. I found it hard as the track was so wide, to find the apex. I was more worried about aiming for the cones, the instructors said to aim for, than actually driving. I enjoyed it very much</p>

    <title>Bootleg Beatles</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura had passed her nursing exams! Hooray. I turned my room into a romantic restaurant with one candle-lit table for 2. On the menu was Cheese Strata. I gave Laura the Evita CD as a present and bought surprise tickets for the night’s performance of the Bootleg Beatles.</p><p>The Bootleg Beatles were performing down at the BIC. It was great to see so many people there and the bootleggers were great. They performed roughly in chronological order, dressing up in various outfits they wore at the time. It was a weird concert. There were seats as if it were a school assembly, in this massive hall. Still we both enjoyed it allot.</p>

		<p>Went to the White Hart with Laura and the Boys. The famous "Barrie Raffle Ticket" incident. We all got really drunk. Barrie hadn't realized he'd won the raffle. When he did he argued with the bouncer, and said, 'I know you are a chain, I've seen loads of White Harte's. I'm gonna call your head offices and complain'. Cracking night.</p>

    <title>Dissertation Hand In</title>
    <info>
		<p>I can't begin to tell you the extreme highs and lows of my dissertation. The dissertation analyzed the software developer, Michael Jackson's, new way of describing Software Requirements in a structured method. My dissertation has consumed my life for a year or more. I can only describe it to be similar to a best man's speech, where no matter how hard you work at it, it sometimes doesn't come out as intended. It's something that eats at you every spare moment you have. Given the extra pressure of it determining the grade you get and therefore how you are set for the job market, the amount of money you can command, etc. etc.</p><p>My vow at the start of the academic year was twofold. One - was to understand everything being taught to me at the time it was taught. This way I would relieve myself of pressure at the end of the year when exams came around. Every other previous academic year I've ever been through, relied on me learning stuff in revision. Revision should be for topping up and refreshing arguments to put into answers, not to try and understand something taught 6 months previous, or for you to rote learn stuff.</p><p>Two - Was to work hard at the dissertation early on and not to leave it to the last minute. Unfortunately, I done both. Worked extremely hard at it and left it to the last minute. I remember in the last month or two, just working 12+ hours a day in front of the computer, pruning, adding, adjusting, researching, reading. I think it came to about the week before where I had all the content, but absolutely no structure, or putting my point across to the reader. I panicked severely. I think I was taken to the edge. I remember crying on the phone to Laura one evening whilst she was back in Gravesend, and she drove down (with Charlotte who she was babysitting so to speak) all the way to Bournemouth just for a few hours. I needed her so badly then. I don't think I've needed someone there for me so badly. She was a godsend at the time.</p><p>I remember I also poured out to dad my dissertation woes. I went home and he tried to help me sort it out. He even arranged to go and meet his friend from the railway. Although they did not really help directly, I realised I was making things so much more complicated than they were or needed to be. I decided to make it an introduction into Michael Jackson's ideas. My first step was to impose a structure almost a contents page, writing the conclusion first, and leading the reader to that conclusion. I continued by putting a bit more detail into the headings, stating what each paragraph was attempting to relay to the reader.</p><ul><li>It taught me a great lesson in methodically going through a relatively complicated topic.</li><li>It taught me that without an initial goal, a project can have no direction. As I was writing it through the early, middle months, I just thought 'oh it will just all fall into place'. However, it didn't.</li><li>It showed me that my family and Laura really cared about me. It was very warming to know this</li></ul>

    <title>Chill Out Before Finals</title>
    <info>
		<p>Revision for my finals has gone as well as can be expected. I was very happy that I had kept to my schedule and that I actually have learnt stuff. I figured what subject areas are going to be brought up, and just try and remember each side of the argument on that subject. I had learnt everything that I wanted to for the exams. Written condensed versions for the days leading to the exams.</p><p>I had been working so hard towards them, and felt fully prepared. So much so, I decided that going home to mum and dad and having as relaxing a time as possible at home was the best thing for me. I remember doing gardening out the front.</p><p>My exam schedule was tough. Whereas others had gaps between their exams, mine were one day after the other. I was glad because the pressure for me would be over quicker!</p>

    <title>Finals Celebration - Weymouth</title>

All gets a bit blurry. I think Susan and Gary came down, and Laura played the part of frogger after exiting the nightclub! Still not sure how one of the cars had actually hit her.</p><p>I remember chasing her down into the town, but she was running completely scared. I didn't want her going around the centre of Bournemouth on her own at that time of night. However, I didn't want her to do something stupid like run in front of a car again. Eventually we caught up with each other.</p></woops><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1997/97_05_24-Weymouth03.jpg</src><caption>Weymouth</caption></image>

    <title>Laura's 21st Birthday - Wimbledon Tennis - Sleep Over</title>
    <info>
		<p>The night before we camped over at in the queue at Wimbledon. However, I forgot the tent poles. I blame Susan really, as it is her tent, and she packed it away last. So we had to make do using the tent as a large sleeping bag. But the condensation during the night was awful. During the middle of the night, whilst it was lightly raining, I went out to get a big stick to use as the mast for the tent. I kind of worked. I think that nights experience was exactly what I hate about camping. Cold, rainy, condensation, bad night’s sleep.</p><p>We made our way to Dad's office in Blackfriars for a cup of tea and a bit of warmth and rest bite. I had to salvage Laura's birthday which wasn't going to well up to now.</p><p>We ventured to the old operating theatre where there was a presentation. I fell asleep during this, but Laura assures me that it was very interesting.</p><p>We went over to Covent Garden and mooched around a bit there.</p><p>We managed to get tickets to see the matinee performance of Miss Saigon at Drury Lane. I must admit I wasn't that gripped, and found it hard to stay awake. In fact I spent more time asleep and I couldn't tell you the story line. Laura on the other hand was involved! She loved it.</p><p>In the evening we went out for a nice meal at an Italian, Donatello's</p>

I believe Mick Weight and Keith Bloodworth also interviewed me. I mentioned my enthusiasm for database applications which I had done for Armstrongs's. This and my overall enthusiasm, rather than any technical know how, seem to have won them over.</p><p>I went for a second interview on Monday 21st.</p><p>In the meantime I was working for Roger Hipperson who had a number of projects that required doing. One was a stock system written using BTrieve. Another was a VB app which showed a user inteface for a fighter plane!</p>

    <info>
		<p>We drove through to Ejstrupholm and saw where my ancestors were christened and buried. We stopped off for something to eat. Later on we went to the place where steam engines run.

We made it to Abeltoft with seconds to spare to catch the Sea Cat over to Zealand from Ebeltoft to Sjællands Odde!</p>

We saw that Uncle Bob had done something similar over in Aus, which was quite interesting to see his way of life. In the evening we had our usual pasta meal, then went down to Brighton pier to watch the final qualifier for the World Cup, England V France. Great game. We outclassed the Italians.</p>

		<p>I was still having troubles with my leg after I twinged some ligaments/muscle in my knee. During the night it was really hurting so we popped down to the County hospital. It was a Sunday, and I was low priority and the queue was already 3 hours. We eventually gave up waiting after 1.5 hours as it became evident that I was not going to be seen to. We done a bit more filming around Brighton, then went to the Sussex Yeoman for its sausage meals. They were gorgeous. We played 3 games of risk in the afternoon and went back to Istead Rise to have a quiet night in. I left Monday morning to go to work. The alarm didn't go off, so I was a bit late.</p>

    <title>Woking Curry-Quiz Night</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura came to see AFP's, not so impressive Knaphill offices. She was impressed! After a quick tour we went back to get some wine and went off to Woking to participate in a quiz. All Laura's family were there including Ellie and Michael. The quiz was difficult with boring questions. We had drank 3 bottles of red between us and a strong curry.</p><woops rating="6" woopstitle="Sick in grandparents-in-law car twice"><p>As we were travelling home I leant out of the moving car and threw up, which was a bit embarrassing seeing that I was in Laura's grandparents car. The sick splattered the back wing of the car! We stopped, I caught some fresh air, and sat on the other side of the car. Then.... it happened again as we travelled along Gole Road!</p><p>I was also sick during the night (but didn't remember it). Laura's granddad got the hose pipe out the morning after to slosh down any residue!</p></woops>

We got a guided tour of Susan's new abode before we saw Pulp Fiction and Shooting Stars. The party of nine of us went down to the One Oak pub where I had a nice chat with Susan. I got refused to get served as well as I didn't look 18!! I am 22.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Had an early start. Had breakfast at a Happy Chef before moving on to Blenheim Palace for the morning's racing. Was very good, very noisy and a lot of popping of un-burnt fuel. On the way I took inspiration and decided to do a few of my 'moves' on the sodden, grassy car parks. The 360's went down well with the passengers I think, until the point they thought the car was going to roll!</p><p>We then moved on and in the afternoon arrived at the special stages at Millbrook, a purpose built car test track. Steep hills and hairpin bends. A good, but exhausting days racing.</p>

    <title>Auntie Grace Dies</title>
    <info>
		<p>Auntie Grace died today at the age of 90. I hadn't realized that she was ill. Auntie Grace to me had always been such a funny, kind lady for whom I'll take away so many fond memories. We used to visit her down in Deal at least once a year. Susan and I would find it boring all the talking she did with dad about family history and what not. Stuff I'd absolutely loved to hear about now. Times in the war. Sadly too young too appreciate. Anyway, Susan and I used to play hockey and golf with the Dixon's walking sticks. Another memory was the outside toilet. The only house I remember with an outside loo.</p><p>I can remember the smallest kitchen in the world, the shaking hands when pouring the tea (something Susan suffers with now) and the 'Do you want anymore duck?'. The Dixon's had a chair lift up and down the stairs in their later years which for kids like us provided more entertainment. Those stairs were quite steep though I seem to remember. Grace was a little lady, with a smiley face, white hair and had a great character. First time she saw mum, the first thing she said to her was 'Do you want a bath duck?'. She held quite some knowledge of the family tree. I remember once watching a cine film from the 1930's with Grace and Norman. The event of watching it with them was really funny. Plumes of dust billowed from the projector, Norman not hearing Grace's command to stop and the noise that the projector made was really loud. This is more Norman, but years back we went for a drive with Norman, and he drove so slowly that there was a queue irrate traffic behind him. He continued unflapped and seemingly oblivious to the modern need to rush about. Grace and Norman, I miss you so much. With the inheritance money passed, I bought a picture of two Hurricane's flying over your native London to remind me of you. It has hung above the fireplaces in both our homes for the past 10 years.</p>

    <title>Valentine’s Day</title>
    <info>
		<p>We drove to Chiswick and walked the length of the high street, from Chiswick Park tube to the Polish tourist information. It was a really hot day and it was very relaxing walking in the sun. We caught a bus to Fulham Broadway and began to make our way by foot to the Kings Road, via Chelsea FC. There were many antique shops, but wasn't until we reached a mile or so up that we saw the hub of the Kings Road. We walked and eventually ended up Sloane Square by about 5 or 6 o'clock. We bought some magazines and sat in the square reading them for 45 minutes. It was nice to stop and have a break. We caught the tube to Piccadilly Circus and briefly went in the Rain Forest Cafe. It was somewhere to come back to at a later date. We popped over to the Burlington Bertie for a couple of hours. We then walked through Soho to the Topo Gigio restaurant and almost sat in the same place as 2 years previous. I had raw beef and wild boar. The beef was great. Want to try that again. A lovely evening. Anyway we caught the tube back to Chiswick and drove us home.</p><p>We went back to Top Gigio again for a nice Valentines meal.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1998/98_02_14-TopoGigioBrewerSt.jpg</src><caption>Valentine’s Day in London</caption></image>

    <title>Charlton V Sunderland</title>
    <info>
		<p>Managed to get tickets to watch the vital match between Charlton and Sunderland at the Valley. I think Sunderland ended up the victorious team. They had both Phillips and Quinn playing for them.</p>

		<p>Went up with Laura to Derby for the weekend. I think it was the time we went to a nightclub and we saw people go onto stage and eat dog food! Not big and not very clever.</p>

    <title>Prague - Getting There</title>
    <info>
		<p>This was going to be Laura's first ever flight. At 7:20am she was quite nervous. Mum and Dad took us to the airport and we were free to look around the duty free. Laura was quite excited. I was looking forward to seeing the culture out in Prague. How much of the effects of communism could you still see? How did a city look with many of its buildings still intact after 600 years. What were the shops and people like? How cheap was it, how big is Prague and what was the food like?</p><p>The flight across was good. However, it was a little cloudy, so difficult to see much out of the window. Laura squealed as we took off and crushed my right hand at the same time! She didn't take her seat belt off for the whole journey. After an hour and a half we landed at Ruzyne airport which was about 25 miles north west of the city. We were advised not to take a taxi, so we took a bus to Dejvicka which is the end stop on the metro. At this point we didn't know where the hotel was. We eventually found it after talking to a tourist information girl. The big 3 star hotel was 6 or 7 miles north east of the city and placed on the edge of a large estate of flats which lined a long straight road. The flats were grey and ugly and seemed very tatty. Hotel Duo (Teplicka 17), was lilac in colour, with a sports centre, bar and restaurant. We gathered our keys and went to our room on the fifth floor. The room was again lilac with an en-suite. Two beds were joined together to make a double.</p><p>After unpacking, we went back into town and landed at St. Wenceslas square. We didn't know that at the time though. We looked around the market, which in the end was tedious as everything being sold was the same. We ate out and the waitress was overcome when I gave her a £2 tip for a £20 meal.</p>

    <title>Prague - City Tour</title>
    <info>
		<p>Went on a 3 hour tour. It was on a funny 16 seater bus which was very colourful. We went through the old town square, the Jewish quatre, and spent half the tour at the castle. I was getting tired at this point and the weather was very good. We collapsed in a park back at St. Wenceslas Square, where we wrote some postcards out. We eventually made it back to the hotel, got changed and refreshed ourselves before going back for the 8pm performance of Vivaldi's concert. We arrived a little late and got told off for trying to film to musicians. It was a new experience. I imagined this is what a concert to be like 200 years ago. The four seasons were played along with some other pieces which I did not recognise.</p><p>After the hour's performance we trundled across Charles bridge, and found a little restaurant to eat in. This is where Laura was almost sick on some caraway seeds.</p>

    <title>Prague - Coming Home</title>
    <info>
		<p>The last day came round quickly, which we started off with a massage. I was hoping for a nice, fit girl, instead 9 foot, hulk massaged us for 15 minutes each. We used the swimming complex everyday and it only cost £1 for an hour. We packed up and checked out all our luggage, but still had 7 or 8 hours before our flight. We made our way to Nadr Holesevice station where we based all our travel around. I tried to find where we could go by train for a short excursion. The booking clerk officer was quite unhelpful and unfriendly. This was the general perception I have with the Czech people. It was quite a shock. However, we laughed it off and got help from a foreign exchange cashier. We went out to some remote town village, that had a castle at the top of the hill. We didn't make it that far, but it was nice to get out of the city. The train journey was a bit weird. The train pulled out of the station for about 100 yards. Then stopped, broke down. We all had to get out and walk back down the tracks to the platform. Can't imagine that happening at Waterloo.</p>

    <title>Amsterdam - Casuals Tour</title>
    <info>
		<p>We left from Farnborough at 7am in the morning on a Whippet type bus. There must have been about 10 of us, including a couple of non football players. We drove to Dover and caught a ferry over to Ostend. The poor bus was absolutely being hammered at 70mph, and it took its toll in Belgium somewhere, as the engine was overheating. The driver eventually just left the radiator cap off the bus and we continued on for another 20 minutes, stopped, filled up with water, and so on.</p><p>The extra time gave us plenty of time to drink some of my special concoctions bought back from Prague. The disgusting bottle of 'Stock' was legendary as well as the yellow stodgy stuff that wiped Mr. Avez out.</p><p>We eventually arrived in Amsterdam, and after getting lost, we found 'The International Budget Hostel' or something like that. Mr. Aves offered to pay the bus driver his digs, as he didn't bring any money.</p>

    <title>Amsterdam - Casuals Tour</title>
    <info>
		<p>Woke up to hear that our knackered mini-bus had been bricked in, and my bottles of Stock had gone. The bus driver had to drive it back to England and get a replacement for us! Poor man.</p><p>Beers, beers, beers. Mr. Avez wasn't feeling too good after the yellow stuff the day before. We wondered around a bit. I think I ended up on top of a car that had a massive clog with flowers in it. Sounds weird, but I didn't imagine it.</p><p>On one of the evenings there was an almighty commotion. After returning back after a skinful of beers a few of the boys were smoking inside the hostel. I was mucking around and moved a wardrobe in front of the 'old boys' room, I then got hold of a fire hose and unreeled it and tied up to the wardrobe. Basically there was no chance of them getting out of their room.</p><p>Unknown to us were smoke detectors, and of course before long the smoke alarm bells went off for the whole building at about 3am in the morning. We all scampered back into our rooms and pretended to be asleep. Then we heard a rushing of footsteps coming up the steep stairs. It was a bit like a headmaster rushing up to see the naughty boys at a boarding school. We all lay really still in bed, and pretended to be asleep. The woman opened the door, and shouted who has been smoking? No one answered. She asked 3 or 4 times, and Phil spoke softly. Again unknown to us there was a flashing light going off above our door to say where the source of the smoke came from so it was very difficult for us to deny what had happened. That coupled with the moved wardrobe, I don't think we were flavour of the month. I don't think the old boys were very impressed either. You had to be there, so funny.</p>

I quite enjoyed it as it was a break for the usual drinking was getting a bit same-ish after a while.</p><p>I remember going to a Belgium beer bar where we met up with the old boys. Phil Clennel was wasted. They were serious drinkers. I remember coming out of there and seeing some man shouting out of the window. Can't remember if he was shouting at us. I retorted by shouting 'Ajax Pall' to him. Don't think he knew what to make of it.</p>

I thought it would be nice to go out and celebrate by going out for a meal, and getting a well done present, perfume, and card. We went to the Windmill in Windlesham. It was quite busy and the food reasonable. We were both starving and gagging for a pint. We then went to the White Hart and talked about Laura moving down this way. We also talked about plans for going to Australia in May 2000 and moving into together eventually.</p>

    <title>Bournemouth University - Summer Ball</title>
    <info>
		<p>I had just received my PII 300Mhz machine which I was busy setting up. Laura was reading her Coming Home book which she was equally enthused about. After lunch we went to watch Steve play bowls in Cranleigh.</p><p>The three of us then went from thereto Bournemouth to eat and get ready for the Summer Ball. However, it didn't feel very summery with the mild, wet weather. We got to the ball about 9:30pm. It was situated near Hurn Airport. We were first frisked, even checking the contents of our wallets. It was still semi-light. We headed towards the bar (drinks) marquee, which was extremely busy. We then headed towards the big top which was huge, circus sized. It had the atmosphere of a night club. Many were wearing fancy dress which I thought was excellent and really in the spirit of the party. We danced the night away. Me and Lau didn't really know anyone else there. Later on we all went around the fairground bit and had a laugh. We continued to dance until around 3am, when it was time to depart for the bus back to the beach for the 'survivors' photo. Crushing, long queues for the buses. Must have been an hour. It was light again by the time we got one. We were still in good spirits. We made it to the pier, many were playing football, drunk and falling over, bumping into Laura. We waited and waited and eventually gave up at 4:45am on the photograph as we didn't think it was worth being a dot on a photograph.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1998/98_09_XX-BournmouthSummerBall01.jpg</src><caption>Bournemouth Summer Ball</caption></image>

    <title>Laura's 22nd Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>Because we had just started in new positions, I'm now a C++/MFC developer now, we thought it a bit too much to take time off work. Instead we met after I finished work. I met her around her Grandparents where Laura opened her cards and presents. Laura asked for money this year as her present, and she managed to accumulate about £90. I gave her a booklet that I had spent two days making, and Evita on video. Anyway we got the train and tube to Leicester Square, walked through China town and made it to the Rain Forest Cafe, Shaftsbury Avenue. The interior was superb. The restaurant was in the basement and it had lots of trees (fake of course), a waterfall, smell of a forest and of course some animal noises. Lightening, flashing lights went off every 20 minutes. The food was good, if a little expensive. We had cocktails first which made it feel a special evening, a good evening.</p><p>After the meal we popped to the IMax theatre at the Troc to see New York In 3D. I fell asleep as usual.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1998/98_06_25-GaysBackgarden02.jpg</src><caption>Laura's Birthday - Our back garden</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1998/98_06_25-RainForestCafe02.jpg</src><caption>Laura's Birthday - Rain Forest Cafe</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1998/98_06_25-RainForestCafe03.jpg</src><caption>Laura's Birthday - Rain Forest Cafe</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1998/98_06_25-Tube.jpg</src><caption>Laura's Birthday - On Tube Station</caption></image>

We eventually entered a pizza parlour at the edge of Trafalgar Square and Whitehall (after running out of one restaurant because it was too expensive). We made it back home for an early evening where we got ready to go out to David and Rachel's.</p><p>We arrived there about 10pm. The flat was large. James Anderson was there and two others, who were David's friends. However we weren't best pleased what was going on and felt very uncomfortable. Topic of conversation wasn't that uplifting either. We left at 2am.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1998/98_06_27-HorseGaurdsParade01.jpg</src><caption>Me at Horse Guards Parade</caption></image>

It was the first time either had come round to my house. The match was very gripping and Denmark even took the lead. The atmosphere was nice, tense and exciting. Laura and Emma seemed to get along fine. Brazil won 3-2 in the end. After the match we dropped Emma back, as she was tired, and me, Lau and Steve went down the White Hart for a drink.</p>

    <title>House Search</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went shopping in the morning with Laura £120 clothes allowance. 3 hours later we eventually finished. I deserve a medal! We then out with Emma and Steve Laidlaw to look for a place for both of them to live. Emma came along to. We went to look at a place in Prospect Road in Farnborough. Rough. It really wasn't very nice and the other lodger looked really dodgy. I was a bit down after five minutes. I didn't want Laura moving into a place like that. I felt at the time that I wanted to move in with her and care for her. We went home and Steve came round to watch the end of the Holland V Argentina game. Mathew and his friend Mark also came round later on. Mum had set aside this evening as an 'American Evening'. We had an American meal which was a refreshing change. We also tried to play American dominos but Mum and Dad had forgotten what the rules were. We spent the evening playing Risk, watching the Germans get beat, One Foot in the Grave and License To Kill.</p>

    <title>Babar - Swim</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura and Steve had another appointment to see a house in Cove again. This house was in contrast to the other one. It was very neat and tidy, but the main their laid a lot of rules down which Laura did not like. We then rushed over to Gillingham to go yachting with Laura's parents. Steve and Mat came along. This was good fun. Laura slept a lot of the time whilst me and Steve went swimming in the 'med' as Laura called it. The water was green and both of us took a few mouthfuls. Although it was overcast, it was quite warm. Some boatman came along and just as we were getting aboard, he accused of us of being ship vandals!! I had a headache when I came out and didn't feel too good. We must have been in their in half an hour. I thoroughly had a good laugh and enjoyed the cruise. We made it back home by 10 o'clock.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1998/98_07_05-MedwaySwim.jpg</src><caption>Me at Horse Guards Parade</caption></image>

    <title>My 23rd Birthday - Haven</title>
    <info>
		<p>Friday began at 6:30am with present opening before Laura and Dad had to go off to work. I got some 1831 aftershave, a radio, Only Fools and Horses (series 2) and The Spy Who Loved Me. A pair of shorts, and the 'Best Anthems In The World' album, a cocktail shaker, a glass, some chocolates, an Eric Cantona book, a tennis racket and some other nik-naks. I got around a dozen cards. We went to work as usual, but I had a half day.</p><p>We headed down towards Hayling Island and met up with Helen and Nigel in a pub. Spent the evening down at Haven.</p><p>After dinner we went to Helen and Nigel's chalet and had birthday cake and presents from Laura's family. They all sang happy birthday, which was nice. We went off to play snooker, whilst having quite a few bevies. The cabaret, after, we had another 7 odd pints. Finally I tried to down half a pint which I succeeded for 5 seconds ...... but then threw back up into the pint glass it had just came out of. I then tried to drink this!!! but luckily was stopped. I then placed the glass strategically where Laura's mum was. She wasn't looking and picked the glass up thinking it was her drink. Again luckily it didn't go any further, but she wasn't too happy. What a great son-in-law I am. We then went to Hudson's for a bit more drinking and dancing.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1998/98_07_10-Haven02.jpg</src><caption>At Haven, Hayling Island</caption></image>

    <title>Haven</title>
    <info>
		<p>I got up late and just got breakfast in time. We played uni hock, bowls, boules and skittles before all of us went to the greasy spoon on the sea front. After the amusements and a look around the fairground, where I lost a 'lads punching competition', the heavens opened and it began to rain and rain. We done some quizzes in the afternoon, along with a hilarious game of snooker.</p><p>After dinner, We played this wicked drinking game.... Laura's mum interrupted the game and said we had to watch the cabaret. A disco followed and pressure was put on me when a Haven mate asked me to dance. Everyone was very drunk by the end of the evening, especially Steven. We played 21's, a drinking game which was very funny. Will always be remembered for Takazumi Katayama.</p>

    <info>
		<p>I failed to make breakfast today. I was dead to the world. Apparently Steve had woken his Mum and Dad up at 3am in the morning, asking for an alarm clock. He had to leave for bowls early! :) The weather was beginning to spoil things. It was still raining. For most of the day we done quizzes. In the morning we done bowls, croquet and curling, table tennis and trivial pursuit. We had our swimming and sauna competitions as usual which I won. We watched the World Cup final in the evening before the comic show and an early night.</p>

		<p>Monday it was glorious weather again, but it was the end of our long weekend :( We booked out, played a little tennis and went home. We done things around the house before we had to go to work. I played croquet in the evening and I spoke to Steve Laidlaw who moved in temporarily. Laura came round to sleep and we watched the film Trading Places.</p>

    <title>House Searching for Laura</title>
    <info>
		<p>After a very hectic week, I had a hectic weekend planned. We went with Steve Laidlaw to view a house in Cove and in Aldershot. The first property assumed Steve and Laura were going to share a bed together :), so that was out of the question. The other was in Aldershot town centre, small and wasn't available until late August. In between the 2 visits we went to Uncle Peter and Aunty Lindey's house. I've never seen anything like it. It was so untidy and filled with boxes, books and goodness knows what. It was chaos. The front room was no more, instead we had a cup of tea in Peter's office. We all had a laugh and stayed for about half an hour. A really unique and charming place.</p><p>We went to get some fish and chips for dinner and stood over the railway bridge in Frimley Green to eat them.</p><p>Bracknell was next on our tour, to watch the first showing of Godzilla with David, and the 2 Steve's. The film wasn't very hot but it was nice to see the film with some of my work friends and home friends.</p>

    <title>23rd Birthday surprise</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura had an early shift, so I got up with her to make sure she got off OK. I then slept in for a while, as I was so tired. I transferred the graduation and Prague holiday onto video tape. Steve Laidlaw and I went to watch Chertsey get beat in a pre-season friendly in front of 615 spectators. Laura joined us later.</p><p>Me and Lau went straight after the match to catch a train from Chiswick Park to get up to Piccadilly Circus. This evening was my birthday treat. Laura had seen a restaurant from previous trips to London and planned to take me there... However, she couldn't find it. We walked down Haymarket to Trafalgar Square and back to Piccadilly Circus. Arrgghh. We eventually found it on Rupert Street. It was Cafe Fish. I had smoked salmon for starter and the biggest platter you wished to see. It contained crab, three king prawns, normal prawns, oysters, cockles and muscles. It took me about 45 minutes and I still couldn't finish it. It was quite expensive, but very enjoyable. We planned to see the re-release of Grease, but we couldn't find anywhere suitable to watch it, so we made the long trip home and went to bed.</p><image><src>images/years/1998/98_07_18-CafeFish23rdBdaySurprise.jpg</src><caption>My birthday treat at Cafe Fish</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1998/98_07_18-CafeFish-CoventryStreet1.jpg</src><caption>My birthday treat at Cafe Fish</caption></image>

    <info>
		<p>Left early in the morning to go paint balling with James, Barrie, Duncan and Martyn B. Laura went to church, then work. It was great fun and cost about £40 or £50. We played 5 different games, each of them twice. I started off well and tailed off to OK-ish.</p><p>The evening was spent having 'Sunday lunch' then going round to sort Barrie's dad out with his computer. Then played Championship Manager with Steve.</p>

    <title>Lau Graduation Ceremony and Hayling Island</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mum and Dad went on holiday yesterday to see Mormor for 12 days, so Laura came over to stay with me. Steve Laidlaw also moved out today from Susan's old room.</p><p>We left at 8:30am to go to Brighton for Laura's graduation at the Brighton Centre. Once I dropped her off, Dad's car over heated! arrgggghhh. I still had to meet up with Laura's parents and Charlotte. I managed it, just about. The ceremony was 2.5 hours and was OK. Laura was quite nervous. After lunch by the marina, Lau's parents went home and we went to get Lau's photo's done. The pier was a nice resting place, but the fine weather turned to slight drizzle. We went back to the 'old sausage pub', by the station, but it had changed owners and was no longer. :( However, we did eat here, although I did get asked for ID!!! I'm 23!!</p><p>We made our way to Hayling Island where we camped on a 'Ancell Estate' camp site. As the weather was good, I enjoyed the night and got me enthusiastic for camping again.</p>

		<p>We checked out Sinah Warren where Laura and her family used to spend many a holiday when she was a lot younger. It was higher quality than Mill Rythe, but all the holiday makers were over 50! We sunbathed and even swam on the main beech whilst waiting for Lau's parents. They eventually arrived, and after a fry up, made our way to Haven. The temperature was quite hot. We challenged Lau's parents to all of the games. Laura is defiantly not a sportswoman.</p>

    <title>Canal Bike Ride - David and Rachel for BBQ</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura had an early, so it gave me a chance to do some bits and pieces, such as car and bike stuff and shopping for the BBQ. It was the hottest day of the year. When Laura returned we went for a bike ride from St John’s to Byfleet along the Basingstoke Canal. Laura done very well, keeping up the pace. It was a lovely ride and I now want to do the River Wey from Weybridge to Guildford. I have now ridden the length of the Basingstoke Canal (in chunks).</p><p>We rushed home as we hosted our first dinner party. Well not really a dinner party, more of an informal BBQ. The guests were David and Rachel from work. It flowed quite well, although the dinner was slightly burnt and Lau was very nervous. We sat in the back garden, and had a laugh. It was nice and something I would like to try again. We left the washing up and carried over the evening to Bracknell to watch 'Lost In Space', a sci-fi about a family and crew in space. It wasn't really up to much. 5 out of 10, so said everyone.</p>

		<p>Another early shift for Laura. I went to the first training session of the season for Casuals. I thought I'd done reasonable well. After post match drinks I went round to Barrie's to watch Man Utd get thrashed by Arsenal in the Charity Shield.</p><p>Later in the afternoon we showed Laura's parents her new place in North Camp / Farnborough. You could see right down the runway of Farnborough airfield. We then went to Chiquitto's, a Mexican restaurant, for Emma Barnett's 30th birthday. I wasn't impressed by the food, but it was a good laugh.</p>

We managed it home by midnight after a short excursion for Chips and half Fish!</p>

    <title>Dover to Ramsgate bike ride via Linda and Alan's</title>
    <info>
		<p>We set off early in the morning in the drizzling rain towards Dover. We dumped the car and began our trek to Deal via the cliff top route. At first it was a difficult ride, with hills and awkward terrain. It became easier and the weather brightened. The scenery was good and you could quite easily go over the top so to speak. We approached St. Margaret Bay (where Auntie Ada used to live) when Laura screamed out. She'd been stung by a wasp. It had taken us a while to reach this point, so we decided we had to get a move on and took the road route to Deal.</p><p>We got to Linda and Alan's and was told we were going to Linda's family BBQ. David and girlfriend, Alison, were also there and we chatted quite well. After spending a couple of hours there we both cycled on to Sandwich along the toll road. It was really nice. Laura then took the train to Ramsgate, whilst I cycled. I managed to beat her there! We spent ages trying to find Gerry's boat, who was moored in the marina area. There were loads of boats. After we found it and met up, we went for fish and chips and a few drinks down the pub.</p>

		<p>Laura was working an early on the day we were to leave for our summer holiday, so I had to do a lot of the packing. I was looking forward to getting away, but wasn't ecstatic as we weren't going abroad. Still a cheap holiday means more money for Australia.</p><p>We drove down and stopped off at Millfield school where I had been on 2 previous holidays, and Weston Super Mare, which was lively. It reminded us of Southport a bit. We camped close by for the night.</p>

		<p>We left early on Monday morning to look around Exeter swiftly, then shifted on to the Torbay area. The weather at last was good. We walked to the beach in Paignton where we saw Matthew Marsden and Bewitched on the radio 1 road show.</p><p>In the afternoon we went to Goodrington Sands where there was a water slide park. This was ace! 7 slides all of which were brilliant. I went go-karting afterwards, then drove to see Brixham, before spending ages finding a campsite in Torquay.</p><p>Torquay in the evening had almost a Mediterranean feel to it.</p>

    <title>West Country Holiday - Dartmoor, Plymouth, Bodmin</title>
    <info>
		<p>The weather turned for the worse as we made our way through the Dartmoor hills. I felt sorry for the ice cream van in a car park with no punters. We reached Plymouth for lunch. In town there was a YHA shop which had lots of information about holidaying in Australia, especially for those who wanted to travel around. Plymouth seemed out of character to the south west. I suppose being a big navel town it was a little different anyway. It wasn't pretty, filled with 60's and 70's style buildings. After looking around the shops, we scooted to Bodmin. Due to the worsening weather we decided to stay in a B+B. This B+B was in fact someone's house, where we stayed as guests. A bit weird but quite nice really. We had a pub meal, watched Bodmin get beat by Penzance in water polo, then I done 500m of swimming, a record for me I think!</p>

    <title>West Country Holiday - Polperro, St Austell, Newquay</title>
    <info>
		<woops rating="8" woopstitle="Knocked Over OAP In Car"><p>The weather was just about OK today. We were tipped to go to Polperro on the south coast. I managed to knock an old man over whilst driving really slowly in the narrow streets. I got out srtaight away. He was OK thankfully. Not sure how I managed it.</p></woops><p>After a lot of walking we made our way to St Austell where we went to a boring shipwreck museum, then to a brewery.</p><p>We moved on to Newquay, which was buzzing with holiday makers. The campsite was an expensive £11! We looked around the town in the evening before watching Man Utd playing in a European Cup prelim round.</p>

    <title>West Country Holiday - Truro, Falmouth, Lizards Point</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Laura swum in the sea for 15 minutes in Lusty Cove just by Newquay. I was too chicken and not one to usually to shy away from these challenges, but Laura beat me fair and square with this one. It was bloody cold for an early morning swim.</p><p>We then looked around Truro, then onto a Cider farm which was quite nice.</p><p>We went to Falmouth where we promenaded and circle the Falmouth AFC ground where I had been 10 years previous. We drove through the back roads to Lizards Point where we had a nice meal and evening stroll along the cliff tops. The campsite was nice and for once I had a good nights' sleep.</p>

    <title>West Country Holiday - Penzance, Lands End, Home</title>
    <info>
		<p>We drove to Lizard lighthouse in the morning, before making our way to Penzance where we again looked around the town. We finally made it to Lands End where there was an enclosed village area for tourists. We relaxed there for a while. Our mission was reach there and so it didn't seem important to stay on travelling any further. It was about 5pm and proposed to go home and try do the whole journey along the A30! This is what we done, however going via St. Ives. We made it back by 11pm!</p>

However they were about to sail back towards Gillingham, so we took Charlotte and spent half a day at Margate beach and Dreamworld before heading on to Queenborough. We then made it back to my place that Night. Total mileage for the 8 days was about 1200 miles!!</p>

    <title>Lau in the Paper</title>
    <info>
		<p>It's been several weeks since I've been out with my friends. Me, Nick, Martin and James went down the Kings Head for a few bevies. That evening I had a phone call from Laura's grandma reporting that she was picture in the Camberley News. Laura had lost her graduation picture, someone had picked it up and given it to the paper, appealing for the owner to collect it. Only would happen to Laura :) Anyway I bought 4 copies of the paper and took it down the pub for the lads to see. Laura came down a little later and made a big scene and got all embarrassed. We all had a laugh in the end.</p>

		<p>I went to see Chertsey beat Leatherhead to go top of the table. It wasn't the best I've seen them play, but they played intelligent, attractive, keep-ball football. In the evening we were supposed to meet up for Jas's birthday in Bar Mambo, Guildford. However, as we arrived a little later we seemed to miss them.</p>

    <title>3rd Going Out Anniversary</title>
    <info>
		<p>The Mongolian restaurant (Jolly Farmer Roundabout) was a choice we both wanted to do, as our list of different kinds of food has grown. We taxied down in the dark, miserable weather. We weren't quite sure what to expect:- An Indian or a Chinese style meal? Since I've converted Laura to meat, the range of restaurants we have to choose from is much larger. Anyway this was a buffet type affair where you choose which foods you wanted and could keep going back for more. Anyway an enjoyable night.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1998/98_09_08-GoingOutAnniversary-1.jpg</src><caption>3rd Going Out Anniversary</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1998/98_09_08-GoingOutAnniversary-3.jpg</src><caption>3rd Going Out Anniversary</caption></image>

    <title>Kieron's Wedding</title>
    <info>
		<p>The weather was on off-ish all day for Kieron's wedding. A family occasion. However, it showed to me how detached we were to this part of the family. I think we only exchanged a few words with them. I blame dad for that. The service was performed by the Archer hotel, Shepperton, the reception at the Runnymede Hotel. It was nice to catch up with Susan again.</p>

		<p>Me and Lau decided to treat her family as a thanks for their help and support, and to say goodbye to Ellie who was off to Germany for her placement year. We took them to a hotel by the river front in Gravesend. It was a really good evening. I want to claim this as the largest amount I have eaten in one course. It was a huge mixed grill.</p>

		<p>We had a lie in, before retrieving our cars from Fleet. We took Barrie along to watch Chertsey draw 2-2 with Romford. He enjoyed it and wanted to go next week.

    <title>100km Bike Ride - Havant</title>
    <info>
		<p>I left at 5:50am to meet Paul Maynard by the motorway. It took 50 minutes to get to Havant where we started our ride. We met up with Jon Cooper. This charity event had about 120 riders of which 90% seemed serious or club riders. We departed at 7:50. After 3 or 4 miles I decided that I wanted to push away from the other 2 as I fancied keeping up with the club riders, which I did for a few miles.... then my chain looped in a couple of places and had to stop to my extreme annoyance for 3 or 4 minutes. I expected the other 2 to pass me, but they didn't. I continued solely but got lost from West Meon. I ended up close to Droxford. Having gone 5 or 6 miles out of my way I met up with Jon (who was on his way back) and Paul at the half way stage. I took on some much needed food and drink. I was determined to try and catch Jon up, although I went with Paul for the first 3 or 4 miles, which meant walking up some hills. Jon must have been 45 minutes ahead by now and so gave up hope passing him. I cycled on my own for all the way back, only passed by 3 or 4 club riders who were going impressively fast. My bike was a cheap wreck. I couldn't get to the bottom 7 or 8 gears nor the top 3 or 4. As a result I really struggled up the hills. I also struggled down them with less than adequate brakes! The hill at Exton was memorable, not only for its size, but because I had climbed it when I went wrong the first time round! One I would like to re-visit.</p><p>Quatre past two, I ambled back to the finish line. I was starving. I was surprised not to see Jon. Both he and Paul got lost and so all ended up doing closer to 70 miles. I waited half an hour for Jon and one and a half hours for Paul. I felt surprisingly fit after the ride. An hour later and I could do everything again.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1998/98_09_27-Laura.jpg</src><caption>Laura in my bedroom</caption></image>

		<p>This weekend was very much a croquet weekend. It was the last weekend that the Woking lawns were open until next spring. I woke in the morning a bit worse for wear after my trip to the football club o see 'Bill Poster Will be Band'. It was the first time in years I sat down with Hedgehog to watch it/ They were very good.</p><p>Laura came to watch me beat Andy Davies, who had played in the All England National Finals the week before. Laura was on a late shift, while I went down with Dad to watch Chertsey lose to Bognor. Their club was very nice. Seemed like they had a good setup there. The evening was spent playing Championship Manager 2.</p>

		<p>I had early start as the mighty Casuals were playing down in Eastleigh. However, I was on the bench and was disappointed only to get a 2 minute run out.</p><p>I rushed back to play Andrew Dutton in the B class level singles, which I won. However, I only reached there because Lionel had retired due to his leg. Laura had joined me and watched. She said she was "proud" of me!! We went down for a short while where dad was laying a floor down for our newly fitted kitchen. Lau went to even-song, while I had a long overdue bath.</p><p>We went to Emma and Phil's in the evening where we had take away Pizza, played chess and chatted, which was nice.</p>

The food was good. I had a lovely crab for starter that I could really taste, then a slightly tougher than expected veal in a creamy sauce for main. After 2 hours and £107, we finished and went for a drink in a nearby pub.</p>

Was a bit disappointed as it was mainly an excuse to sell souvenirs to the punters. The M/C didn't quite know what to say next sometimes. It was nice to see and sit inside both the three wheeled van and the capri-gear. We queued up for 2 hours for Ken McDonald's and John Challis's autographs.</p><p>We made our way home through central London which took ages. doh!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1998/98_10_11-OFAHConventoin-BoycieMike.jpg</src><caption>Us with Boycie and Mike at the OFAH Convention</caption></image>

We had a drink in the Australian theme pub, Walkabout, which wetted my travelling dreams. Then walked towards Highbury... Boo.</p><p>We caught the underground back to the car and drove straight to the Spectrum where we saw the Guildford Flames play the Kingston Hawks. We went with Phil and Emma, Lau's grandparents and Susan and Mark.

		<p>On Thursday of this week I was told by Mick Weight that my pay will rise from 16K to 17.5K. I was quite surprised to hear that other developers were on similar salaries.</p><p>Today I went to Camberley to buy something with Auntie Grace's inheritance money. I wanted to get something related to remember her by. I managed to get a picture of three spitfires flying over London. I was pleased with my purchase, as Grace was from London and she liked talking about the war years.</p><p>I went to watch Chertsey get thrashed by Gloucester City. In the evening we went down to the White Hart with Barrie, James, Nick and Martin then on to the Litten Tree, Camberley. It was buzzing there.</p>

    <title>Laura's Special Dinner - cinema</title>
    <info>
		<p>Charlotte had come over to stay with Laura earlier on in the week. She come over to my house and played Monopoly. She thought Susan was posh! and couldn't believe how I got away with winding my dad up.</p><p>On Friday I went over to Laura's for a surprise evening. She had dressed up and looked gorgeous in her black dress. She had prepared a lamb dinner which was nice and rhubarb and custard (which was inedible burnt!!). She had made her makeup table into a dining table in her room and gave me a present and a card. Because I had already guessed the destination of my surprise trip away treat, she made a booklet of what we'd be doing in New York. It was all very exciting. The place where I've really wanted to go to. After the meal we went to see Small Solders at the Robins cinema. It was entertaining, but not much more than that. We went back to Lau's to finish off the wine.</p><p>We also went to see Small Soldiers at Robins.</p>

    <title>Sutton night out</title>
    <info>
		<p>There was torrential rain Saturday which put pay to Chertsey's fixture. We went to the Hogs Back brewery in Tongham to get Laura's dad some beer for his birthday. We then went and had a look at Tracco, Casuals new home ground.</p><p>We returned back to the house for a fry up, and spent the afternoon playing a borrowed game of Civilization II. I had a boys night planned with work, whilst Laura went out with Steve, Emma, Nick, Martin, Barrie and James to the Litten Tree and Joe Bananas. I however, went to pick David up in Bracknell, then go on to Jon's in Leatherhead.</p><p>We were the first to arrive at Jon's small, but nice, one bedroom flat. We played playstation until Trevor turned up. We took a taxi to Sutton. We got a pizza, then on to a place called Chicago's which was busy. We tried a club called Zoots which was practically empty so came straight back out. It was still raining and queued for 20 minutes to get into Legends night club, only to be turned away because of lack of ID!!! It was the first time I've been embarrassed about being refused entry. I was 23 trying to get into an over 21's. We trudged back to Zoots and went upstairs. There wasn't any atmosphere, no nice looking girls and everyone was on a bit of a downer. Jon and I left an hour later, leaving David and Trevor chatting up some women. I'd spent £50 on a not so brilliant evening.</p>

    <title>Football and Gerry's birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>I got early the next morning to find that Trevor had spilt beer all over Jon's nice carpet and David wanting a return lift. I had to rush back for football in Aldershot. There wasn't a cloud in the sky and I had a hangover. I'd never played a game of football like Sunday's game. The opposition turned up late and eventually only with 8 men. I had been picked for the first time to play left midfield from the start for the season. I scored the best ever goal from outside the box from a corner. I put the ball in the top right hand corner of the goal. There was even a man on the post that couldn't stop it. The game was a complete farce in the end. They played the offside trap successfully first, but soon we started beating it regularly. At time it was 3 or 4 against the keeper. The score ended up 11 or 12 nil.</p><p>As the game began late, we had to rush off to Gravesend, as we had Sunday lunch waiting for us. It was Laura's dad's 47th birthday. The house seemed mad as ever. There was 6 of us around the small kitchen table. After tea we headed back home.</p>

    <title>Fireworks around Susan's</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura was working, so went around Susan's for her (now annual) fireworks party. Straight after I went down the Kings Head and met up with Nick and Martin. Laura joined us a little later. Sounded as though she had a traumatic day at work as a patient fitted in front of her and was close to dying by all accounts.</p>

    <title>Fireworks at Blackheath</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura was working an early, whilst I was mainly playing Civilization II again.</p><p>We left mid afternoon to go and see the big firework display at Blackheath. First we visited Laura's grandparents in Lee. They cooked us a really nice meal. The source was scrumptious. I was full up and could quite have easily fallen asleep. They seemed in reasonable health, spirits high. They told us lots of stories, mainly about the war or sports turf.</p><p>We left about six-ish for the fireworks. Spectacular. The bangers were really loud. Laura said she was afraid. It lasted about 15 or 20 minutes. The only thing was that they didn't have a bonfire this time around. Never mind. We reminisced how we got stuck in traffic the previous year. On the way back, we found that Blackheath was packed. We decided to stop off at the Northbrook pub in Lee. One that Gerry used to frequently frequent.</p>

    <title>Footie</title>
    <info>
		<p>We played away in Medstead near Alton in the Hampshire Cup. We won 3-2 and I played a full game. I don't think I played my best. I felt a bit unfit and realised I needed to get into shape. On the way back we stopped in the Chicken Inn or something on the A31. Laura was working late, whilst I played on the computer.</p>

    <title>Carnaby Street, Festival Hall, Peckham</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had an early-ish start. We caught the train from Woking to Waterloo. We walked to the Royal Festival Hall where we saw the press photography exhibition. It was good to see and inspires me further to take up black and white still photography. However, I need money to buy a camera first! One day perhaps.</p><p>We walked to Carnaby Street where we looked for the New York Visitors Centre which had just opened. We couldn't find it at first, then realised it was a flat address and wasn't open! Carnaby Street was disappointing considering its history. It wasn't very busy. The shops weren't anything special. We then decided to venture into Hamley's which was particularly packed. We were both getting tired and decided next to take a bus ride to Peckham. Every other person was black and every other shop was either a butcher or fishmonger. There seemed to be some trouble at Netto where they had closed the shop, with Police and customers inside and a gathering of people outside protesting in not being able to get in! We then took a further bus to Clapham Junction where we caught the train home.</p><p>We went shopping at Asda where we bought stuff for the evening's pasta meal. After we had tidied the house up and eaten, Helen and Nigel arrived. They were staying for the weekend. They had announced their secret engagement to us. Nigel hadn't asked Helen's Dad yet, and wasn't planning to do so for a few months yet. Laura got very excited and kept going on about me and her getting married, and about being a bridesmaid. Barrie was at a loose end and so came along with us to the Litten Tree. Laura got drunk which was quite funny and told Barrie to get his best man's speech ready. The evening was nice and relaxed and I enjoyed having Barrie there to chat to. After we returned home we had a much needed bacon sandwich and Laura for entertainment.</p>

    <title>Banger Racing</title>
    <info>
		<p>I played football in the morning and won 2-0 playing a full match, whilst the others went to church and made lunch. In the evening we went to the world banger finals at Wimbledon. There were some good races, although the evening was too drawn out. It got a bit boring and cold and at the end willing the thing to finish. I hope Helen and Nigel enjoyed themselves. I think they did.</p>

    <title>Civilization II</title>
    <info>
		<p>Totally addicted to this at the moment. Noticing I'm becoming stressed/short and it's down to this. Played from 9-15pm, when Laura started her night shift, till 4-15am! In the morning I had a headache and I knew I had a hectic weekend in front of me. Not a great move!</p>

    <title>Network Q Rally - Cheltenham</title>
    <info>
		<p>Left at 9:30am with Nick and Martin to go and see the Network Q Rally. Nick reluctantly drove us to the pre rally show at Cheltenham. It was bitterly cold and not as good as last year. The highlight was getting 2 free Ford Focus hats! We left at about 2pm to go back towards Oxford where we were staying the night. The room was nicer than last year and fairly central. After getting changed we left at 6ish and headed for town. We stopped at various pubs, eating at one of them. I was a good evening and at times felt like throwing up. Couldn't handle the pace these boys were setting. I struggled to make it past 6 pints in 4 or 5 hours.</p>

    <title>Network Q Rally - Cornbury Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>We woke at 6:30am with a hangover. The other two, especially Nick wanted to be back in bed. After breakfast we left for a longish journey to Cornbury Park, near Chipping Norton, for stage 2. We managed to see the leading cars for once. I think No.51 was from Chertsey! There were 160 odd cars in all. We stayed until 130 went past before heading off to Donnington. We didn't see anything spectacular. There was a cock-up somewhere as Donnington was up by Derby. A nice long journey. I stayed in the back and slept quite a bit. We arrived early and saw the Classic Rally. We spectated from one of the two manmade jumps. However, most cars took it as a speed hump and slowed right down. We had a couple of hours to kill, so went down the village and had a swift pint down the pub. We returned to the dark skies of the circuit to watch an entertaining double stage. We saw a car catch light and a roll-over. We headed back cold and not looking forward to the long journey home.</p><p>We broke down on the way home as well. Martin said he had AA cover, then realized he hadn't. Lucky Nick somehow got the car going again. He was tired and fell asleep at the wheel for a split second as he smacked into a curb going along the road! A good, long weekend.</p>

    <title>Work</title>
    <info>
		<p>I surprisingly received a work bonus. Not as much as I'd expected, about £700. This coupled with our old Australia money, now house money, can pay off the rest of Laura's bank loan she took out to live down here. Between us we will only have my student loan, which is planned to be paid off by April time. From then on we'll have at least £400 a month to put away.</p><p>Laura was working a late so we got to the Kings Head for last knockings. We met up with Nick and Martin.</p>

    <title>Charlotte, Bazza and Works Xmas Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had a busy schedule. We went with Charlotte over to Bracknell to see the premiere of the remade Parent Trap. A film made for Laura I think. Charlotte seemed to be growing very fast. She seemed quieter than usual. We rushed back for the traditional fry-up before linking up with Barrie to go to watch Chertsey beat Leatherhead 1-0. It was cold, grim and raining.</p><p>We rushed back again to get ready for my works Christmas party which is to be held on a boat on the Thames. The boat is going to sail to Windsor and back (from Maidenhead). I had my dinner jacket, well actually Dads, and Laura looked beautiful in her short blue number. I didn't know many socially. I suppose there was Rachel, James and James but no one I could go and have a long conversation with. Rachel was getting a bit too friendly. We distanced ourselves and Laura and I had a laugh on our own. The bar was free so I continually knocked back the red wine. Laura was driving unfortunately. There was a roulette wheel, a black jack table, and later on a disco and a very small dance floor. It was something different which I think we both enjoyed.</p>

We were both fairly tired for the remainder of the day.</p><p>In the evening we went to Camberley Bowls club for Auntie Sue's and Uncle Richard's 25th Wedding Anniversary. We had a fish and chip supper. Gerry made a speech which he cocked up because he had too much to drink and couldn't read his prepared speech. Carol took over! Quite funny at the time.</p>

    <title>Laura's Ward Christmas Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>This year’s Christmas Party was held at the Hilton Hotel, Bracknell. Both Lau and I were quite excited by it. We met up with Lau's friend, Kelly's flat. I'd never seen any of Laura's nurse friends before. I think there are about 5 or 6 on her ward. After meeting up with another couple in the mini bus which drove us there. We had a few drinks at the bar before making our way to the tables for the food. Laura was modelling her new shortened haircut, a 'graduated bob', very stunning she looked as well.</p><p>Steve was a good laugh as ever. He had another mate which I chatted to a bit. He reminded me of a typical Sandhurst, army officer, student type person. A bit of a mouth. Amanda, Lau's boss, was quite drunk but nice. Many of the elder nurses rated themselves a bit. We sat down at one of the 20 or so tables. There were other companies there as well. The food was OK and there was a real party atmosphere. Laura doing what she does best, saying how sad and dappy she is! Everyone laughs.</p><p>After the meal Steve invited me to snort some Whiskey. I hate Whiskey at the best of times. However, I'll try anything new. First attempt was a bit lame, the second not so bad. Not the greatest method of drinking? The mini bus home was hilarious with one of Laura's stories about her grandpop being a chip shop owner in Wales for the army!</p>

    <title>Casuals Christmas Do</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura was back in Gravesend with Ellie making a surprise early return from Germany. I on the other hand had the Casuals Christmas Do down at Tracco. It was a great laugh with plenty of cheap beer (1.50 a pint) flowing. Me and Michael were pitched together in the table football and lost 8-0! However, my guess work in the scratch card came to fruition. Last week I predicted Dundee just before it was scratched off and it was! Tonight I said Notts County, and hey presto it was! Everyone thought I cheated. I don't know how I done it. I played a couple of games of pool as well. A great evening with all the boys there.</p>

    <title>Reading and Bill Posters</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning I slept and slept. Dad woke me at 10 o'clock. I was supposed to be sleeping over at Laura's where she was going to me there at 9.15. Ooops. She eventually came round, although none too happy. I made some sausage and bacon sandwiches before setting out to Reading, Christmas shopping. The weather was dull, I was tired and hung over and Laura still not happy from the mornings grump. We weren't very impressed by Reading. All I got was some tacky stuff from a pound shop. I just couldn't be bothered. We came home late afternoon, then went to the football club to see 'Bill Posters Will Be' Band and meet up with the family, including Ann and Mark. It was nice to see Ann again. It was an enjoyable evening, although I've seen the act too many times now.</p>

		<woops rating="7" woopstitle="Almost In A Punch Up With Two Mad Glaswegian"><p>I played football in the morning against Mytchett Centre Reserves. We comfortably won and I was taken off at half timed despite playing well, which was a shame because dad turned up at half time to watch me play. However, he almost got us into a fight.</p><p>We had a free kick and one of their players kicked the ball away. Dad made a sarcastic remark, to which their player bit back on. They eventually called dad and 'old c-word' and I replied 'That's better than being a fat c-word'.</p><p>At which a couple of their players started running towards to me. So I turned and begun to run 10 yards or so. They stopped. The rest of the match was very edgy and it had shaken me up. Me and dad left early from the game to avoid any trouble.</p></woops><p>In the afternoon I went to Gravesend. Laura's Grandma and Grand ad were there. We had a large Sunday lunch, put Christmas decorations up, watched  the football, went to a carol service at Laura's old primary school in Bean, watched Sports Personality of the year which Michael Owen won, then went home last in the night.</p>

    <title>Laura's Christmas Party Hospital</title>
    <info>
		<p>I was supposed to play football in the morning, but having a cold and stomach feeling a little dickey, so decided not to go.</p><p>We went to Istead Rise therefore and prepared for the party. One by one people called off. We ended up with Helen, Nigel, Robert, Ellie and Michael and Charlotte. During the afternoon I felt ill. I threw up every hour from one till seven. Blood came out of the last lot. Getting worried Laura called the 'on call doctor'. She eventually suggested to call an ambulance which seemed a bit OTT. I was also getting short of breathe. Once the ambulance pulled up, I was injected, oxygen'ed masked and asked a series of questions. After 10 minutes we drove off to Joyce Green hospital, Dartford. Laura came along and was crying. I would have hated to see her if it was something serious. After a lot of waiting and lying around, we eventually go out at 2am. Laura's dad came to pick us up. Laura was fantastic, being very patient and very supportive. It was something I appreciated loads. I lost a subsequent 3 days from it!</p>

		<p>I worked till 12:30 when I went for a swift drink with work. It was Christmas Presents time! I was worrying what I got Laura and Laura what she got me. I'd bought her the set of 20 Winnie The Pooh books, a knickerbox and M+S underwear set, a yellow fleece and a dress. I know I liked her presents but I thought I should get something she really wants. I'd done a couple of picture frames which I hadn't quite managed to finish.</p><p>I got a video recorder which was excellent. It seems quite a good one, some boxer shorts, a car cleaning kit and other bits and bobs. She spent far too much on me. She's also giving me that New York Trip.</p><ul><li>Flight = 170 * 2 = 340</li><li>Accommodation = 60 * 5 = 300</li><li>Laura Other Savings = 400</li><li>My Contribution (if needed) = 200</li></ul><p>We had a nice meal, then opened presents, then Laura had to work the night shift on Christmas Eve.</p>

    <title>Adventure Travel Show - Italian Restaurant</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura was working an early, so I went to the Daily Telegraph Adventure and Travel Show on my own at Kensington Olympia. It was quite small. I got chatting to a hang glider, which made me dreaming of hang gliding one day. Up in the skies, with everyone below, nothing noisy. Bliss. There was also a speaker who talked about travel writing and photography. I think this would be my second most ideal job after rally car driving. After the show I walked down Tottenham Court Road to try to find some sort of bug device, so I could tape or record when I ask Laura's parents the big question, and when for I ask Laura the big question.</p><p>I plan to do it in New York, perhaps on the Empire State building. Anyway I didn't buy anything. I met up with Laura at Waterloo and we went to an Italian restaurant, St Martin's (or something). It was different. I had the now traditional raw beef. It was a small restaurant, the service was bad, the food not brilliant, but it was fun and different. The waitress even came running out to check we had paid.... which we had. We went looking for a pub and stumbled one close to Trafalgar Square. We were stopped by a women bouncer. I thought we were going to be asked for ID. Instead she warned us it was a gay pub! Suitably embarrassed we walked on to a pub down the Strand.</p>

    <info>
		<p>About 150 people turned up. I wanted to speak to Laura's dad side of the family, as I don't know them so well. Not many of them turned up. Mum and Dad came and they saw some of Laura's family which was good. I spoke to Christine, Michael's dad and Karen and Richard, first time since their engagement.</p><p>Afterwards, it took ages to clean up that night and morning after. Both me and Laura were buzzing and really enjoyed it.</p>

		<p>After organising it seemed, Me, Stewart Hector, Sean Creed and David Guest all met up. First time since the end of university in 1997. Stewart picked me up and he scarily drove us to Sean's house in Lingfield. We went to a nice pub and had a few drinks. Actually I only had 3 1/2 pints, which was quite enough for me. We came home at closing time to play on his Nintendo. We all slept over.</p>

		<p>Stewart drove back on the Saturday and came round briefly for a drink. I went out immediately to Farnham to look for an engagement ring and valentines present. The rings I saw were £700 minimum. A bit over my £350 top limit. I bought the perfume 1881, however for the next weekend. Laura worked an early so we had a few hours in the afternoon together before I headed off to David's for a boys night in. There were only four of us in the end, but I had a good time playing on the Playstation.</p>

    <title>Paintballing and London</title>
    <info>
		<p>I had to get up early to play Paintball over in Effingham. There were about a dozen AFP members. We had about 5 different scenarios, playing each twice. It was enjoyable, but not as good as the Horsham one last July.</p><p>In the evening we made our way up to London to meet up with Laura's friends. Andrew had only got back from Oz a couple of weeks ago. He seemed to have enjoyed himself. We all met in the Griffen pub just by Charing Cross station. We then moved on to the Buzz Bar by Leicester Square. This place was a great and had a club type atmosphere, size and unfortunately prices, but shot at 11 o'clock. I had nice chats with Nigel, Phil (Andrews mate), Richard and Karen. Really enjoyed it.</p><p>Both of us had a bit too much to drink. We passed out on the train back and missed our stop and went on to Fleet. It was freezing waiting for Dad to pick us up.</p>

		<p>We went to see the holiday show which had over 100 stands. I didn't enjoy it as much as last time because I've seen what's on offer. I just want to go and do it. Afterwards we tried the New York visitors bureau again, to no avail, and the BBC also to no avail. However, it was a long, but enjoyable day. I did scrape my car against someone else’s but no damage was done. Training in the evening.</p><p>Susan was back home after Mark wanting a trial separation. Mark did not explain why and Susan is a bit tearful and didn't think there was a problem.</p>

    <title>Engagement Preparation, Tennis, David Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura had two earlies this weekend. This gave me an opportunity to prepare for the engagement in New York. First and most importantly the ring. I've already looked around Farnham and Fleet and have not seen anything suitable. I decided upon Guildford. I trundled over and must have looked around a dozen or so shops. I was beginning to get disillusioned, either rings being too ostentatious, expensive or not right. I want a diamond/ruby ring with a thin ring or band, without a shoulder, spending between £250 and £350. I saw one cheaper at £150, but wanted to spend more on her. I was on my way back when I looked in Ernest Jones and saw one that met my requirements. This sounds bad, but it was £600 reduced to £300. I didn't progress any further as I needed to borrow one of Laura's rings and wanted Susan there as well to get a second opinion. I was very, very happy with my choice. It felt just right. I scooted back as happy as a sandboy. I told Susan and Dad the news.</p><p>After Laura came home and had some lunch we went off to St John’s to play some tennis. I really wanted a good knock around. I'd get immense satisfaction if we managed to get some decent rallies going that lasted more than 4 or 5 shots. We had a good time and said we weren't allowed to go until we had a 10 shot rally. It took us about 20 attempts but in the end we managed 30+ consecutive shots. Wow!</p><p>We went to Sainsbury’s to do out family shop. I bought some strange things. Pineapple, orange and banana juice comes to mind. Laura laughed at me getting done by dad. £56 it came to. I made a pasta carbonaire from Delia, which wasn't brilliant.</p><p>We headed off to another of David's parties. We played Taboo and I think I made an impression with my cheating tendencies. The Playstation inevitably came out which inevitably broke the party up again. We left just after midnight as Lau had an early.</p>

    <title>Mum returns from Denmark</title>
    <info>
		<p>Sunday was spent watching Match Of The Day, waking up late and painting my head stone which was made of glass. It is a head that I have painted to make it look like me. The face is too red. The hair I painted dark blonde then combed brown paint on top. It has to be seen to be believed. I was thinking of putting a light underneath and leave it in her room in Farnborough as a surprise. Then when she came in from a late shift she'd get a bit of a shock! Perhaps for our 3.5 year anniversary!</p><p>Mum returned from Denmark in the evening and went sledging!</p>

    <title>Susan Back Home</title>
    <info>
		<p>Susan came home on Tuesday from Marks. It seems pretty terminal and quite sudden. It's nice to have her back in the house again as a proper sister. Mum and Dad blame Mark as they've only moved in together for 2 or 3 weeks. It seems as if Mark is going to struggle to keep the house. Susan is fine some moments, bit tearful at others understandably. I think she's accepted it's over and wouldn't go back even if asked. In the evening me and Lau went for a walk in Heatherside and was that 32 Dawesmere Close had a 'sold' board outside.</p>

    <title>The Glass Head Story</title>
    <info>
		<p>Nothing special was arranged as Laura was working a late. I had made a glass head to look like myself. I bought the head, which is slightly smaller than real life size, in Kingston, whilst Christmas shopping. Unfortunately the nose bit broke. Never mind, I was undeterred. I'd spent quite a few evenings doing it. I first painted the whole head in a skin colour. However, it turned out too red. Another night I painted an undercoat of blonde hair. Then, I combed brown paint to give it some detail. I then ventured on to the face, which I had lighten somehow, and give it character. In the end I'd finished. Now what should I do with it. Give it as an anniversary present! Instead of just giving it to her. I set it up in her bedroom as a surprise for when she returned from her late shift. I'd put a lamp underneath and switched it on, to illuminate it. When she came home I hid to make it look like it had been left there. When she saw it, she was horrified and ran into the bathroom for half an hour. She hated it and said it was like something out of the Godfather. I tried to talk her out by saying 'don't lose your head' and a million and one other puns. The story ends by me taking back the present that I'd put so much effort and planning into. Hopefully one day she'll come round. My plan was to do one of her and we could have the pair as bedside table lamps! I didn't get a an anniversary present to top it all off.</p>

    <title>2 Weeks to New York</title>
    <info>
		<p>I'm getting very excited about the prospect of going to New York. A) because it's New York and B) Popping the question to Laura. She's been harping on about when we should get engaged and I'm shrugging her off and saying not for a long time yet. However, it's not easy, to keep saying that when in my heart of hearts I'd love to marry her this weekend. Not only does she harp on to me, but to our friends as well. 'Oh Martin and me are getting married' she'll say. I've told quite a few people my plan. I shouldn't really but I'm so excited by it. I haven't told work, any of Laura's family or David. She keeps bluffing me, which is a bit scary. Last night she came out with "You're going to ask me on top of the empires state building. I know your mum told me". For 5 or 10 seconds I believed that she knew. I do want it to be a surprise. I can't wait to see her face. I think she's going to be unbearable. I don't want it to completely over shadow the trip, so I'll give it to her the day before we leave. I plan to do it close to Brooklyn Bridge. The view from there is amazing, looking down towards Manhattan. I'm still not too sure how to ask her. I want it to be serious, but not over the top. I want to make sure we're both in a loving mood at the time. I also want to give her some presents, a CD at least. It's got to be small enough for me to hide in my coat.</p><p>My other problem is asking Laura's Dad. Do I involve her Mum, what do I say, how do I say it, where do I say it and when? All unknown at the moment. The trouble is Laura is going back to Gravesend in the days leading up to New York. However, I don't want to do it before she goes back because I don't her mum not letting the cat out of the bag! I think I'll take them down to The Ship or the Black Horse in Southfleet and ask and go through the financial plan and ask them whether they have any questions. How do I get them down the pub through! Tricky.</p>

There were two tables , the oldies and the youngies. I had a great laugh. Too much so apparently. I was too noisy and excitable Laura said. Laura's mum had got 50 golden things for her parents.</p>

		<p>We went with Steve and Uncle Peter to the Hogsback Brewery. It was very sunny. Laura had a late, while I had a round of golf with David over in Hawthorn Hill, near to Maidenhead. We had a practice on the driving range, where I was terrible. I was missing the ball more often than not. Anyway y we had to hire shoes as there was a dress code that I broke. David teed off well on the first. There was a bit of an audience.... and I fluffed mine. I played badly for the first three holes. I steadily improved from there. I was cracking away my drives. I felt great satisfaction. We played match play and lost 6-3, but had a good laugh.</p>

I got a tape for the dictaphone I borrowed, but couldn't find Flash Gordon (Queen) or Wonderful, Wonderful Copenhagen on CD. Got my haircut done as well. In the afternoon I drove to Hambledon near Guildford where we done some nice cycling. We stopped off at a nice pub in Chiddingfold, for a drink and a read of the paper.</p><p>We moved on to Bognor via the back roads. Having got there we visited a few pubs but couldn't find a decent restaurant. We decided to find a pub on the way back. The one we found was 5 miles north of Bognor, and had a nice locals atmosphere.  We returned home, not going to Jas's do!</p>

    <title>Asking Carol and Gerry's Permission</title>

		<p>Trying to organise this was a bit of a nightmare. I had to tell Laura I was going to David's this evening, so Laura then decided to go back to Gravesend. Great start!</p><p>The next problem was getting Gerry out to tell him, I mean ask him, without letting on beforehand what I wanted to speak about. I told him it was surprise I needed help on. Very good I thought.</p><p>I got to Southfleet at about 8pm and rang to meet in the Ship pub. I asked if Carol could also come. I waited having already bought me and Gerry a pint. They arrived 10 minutes after my call. I waited and agonised at the bar. I just wanted to get it over and done with. My insides were all twisted as I travelled down. I can't remember the exact words, but it went something along the lines "... I was going to ask Laura to marry me in New York". They were very happy especially Carol. I think she went on to organise the wedding that evening. I showed them the ring as well. We must have chatted for about an hour and a half before I returned home.</p>

    <title>NY Trip - Set Off, Grand Central Station, Walking around Manhattan, Empire States Building</title>
    <info>
		<p>An early departure for our memorable trip abroad. Dad dropped us off at terminal 3 at about 7:15am and we headed for check in at United Airlines. We were greeted with a note offering us to travel on a later flight, arriving at Newark airport for £800 each. A chance not to be missed. So we volunteered for this. We checked in and looked around duty free for 20 minutes. I wanted to make sure we had the best possible chance of qualifying by getting to the boarding point first, so our names would be top of the list. However, it didn't work that way and we were not chosen. We boarded and took off at about 9:30am.</p><p>Laura done her usual 'Brace as hard as possible' routine. I thought she was going to have a baby the way she was going. Our flight lasted 7.5 hours and passed quickly with a couple of films and meals to occupy us. The TV screen was built into the back of the seat which was quite neat. We even had a tracking system to guide us, and report our location, speed and altitude. It was a bit cloudy when we landed at about 1pm, but we noticed that even in the suburbs houses were organised in a grid pattern.</p><p>JFK airport wasn't as modern as we'd thought it might be. The usual intermediation of being in a new country hit us almost straight away whilst trying to organise transport for the 20 miles trip to Manhattan. There was a travel information point where we sought help. The so called helper was very official with her advice and manner. Meanwhile Laura was waiting outside with the luggage getting her shins reformed  from trolley pushers who totally disregarded what was in front of them. A bus just arrived as we rushed to get seats. Two black ticket sellers were outside and sold us return tickets and told us to hurry on to the coach. Before I knew I was short changed by $10, but only realised when I got on the bus. This made me annoyed.</p><p>The weather was a bit grim and drizzly, and leaving the airport we noticed how untidy everything was. Our coach trip was about 30 minutes long, and we didn't really see much on the way. We came in through Brooklyn and Queens and through Queens tunnel to Manhattan Island. As soon as we came out the other side we immediately noticed how tall the building are. They make you feel to be at the bottom of a canyon. I'd not seen anything like it before. We were slightly held up in the notorious Manhattan traffic, but were finally dropped off at Grand Central station.</p><p>Excited at the prospect of taking in the atmosphere of New York, we decide to walk to our hotel, with all our luggage. The Arlington Hotel which was on 25th Street by Broadway and fifth avenue. We went passed the library and the impressive Empire State building. We saw the first of many steaming man hole covers and the yellow taxi's, which seemed to make 25% of the traffic. The walk was tiresome as we had to carry all our luggage. We finally arrived at our hotel, which seemed to be in a rough par, although it seemed fine inside with a reception area and nice cafe at the back. Again the receptionist was coarse and could have some of Laura's 'happiness lessons'. The room was basic but clean. The view was other rooms of the hotel and we had an ensuite bathroom. We unpacked and I continually checked the ring was still safely tucked on my inside jacket pocket.</p><p>We left the hotel at about 3pm and headed for the tourist information in Time Square. We got on to Broadway, but to our surprise this area for several blocks looked decidedly dodgy. There were many foreigners, electrical shops and general untidiness. We felt a little apprehensive walking down here. However, the rundown area quickly passed. Time Square is the New York equivalent of Leicester Square. However, this had a number of busy roads running across it. In the middle there were boards up, stopping you entering a building site. There was scaffolding all over the place, seemingly holding buildings up. Having said that, we did get a piece of New York. There were loads of lit adverts, like at Piccadilly Circus, there were news feeds scrolling across, there were loads of yellow taxis, there were many shops and sky scrapers. There were such a large mix of races. I couldn't really see them as Americans. We looked at the half price ticket bureau for Broadway shows but they were still too expensive for us at $40 each. We went to the Visitor Centre (tourist information). We had to go to the bus terminal itself to buy our tickets to Woodbury Common and a sightseeing tour. Our traditional swimming baths visits would not be fulfilled here. You either had to buy a year’s ticket for the municipal baths or go to an expensive.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_03_XX-NewYork66.jpg</src><caption>New York - Time Square</caption></image><p>Never mind. We headed off to the bus station but inadvertently took a de-tour through the unknown then, Hell’s Kitchen area, North West of Time Square. This was once home of gang land territory. Where West Side story is supposed to have been set. Although not the nicest area, I felt safe enough. Laura however, felt a bit intimidated. While we walked along one of the busy roads I was filming. Suddenly somebody lent out of their car and yelled across, 'I love you' or something like that. It was quite funny. A lady, who was  walking towards us, who saw this remarked "it could only happen in New York". To which I thought "only a comment like that could be made by a New Yorker". We eventually made it to the bus station. By now it had got dark. It was closed!!!</p><p>Apparently there were two big stores not to miss. Macy's was close by so we popped in. We weren't very impressed. I expected a Harrods or Selfridges type thing. All we got was an ordinary looking department store. We only saw part of it, and I reckon we just saw the bad bit.</p><p>We continued east along 5th avenue and the Empire State building. To be honest the building didn't look any taller than any other big sky scraper there. It again had scaffolding around the bottom. The interior was very plush. We queued a little bit on our way up the 80 something floors. The left was quick. It took perhaps 30 seconds to get to our destination. We walked outside to the viewing gallery and the views across the New York skyline was amazing. It was very windy. It was difficult to pick out people we were so high up. The highest we'd ever been. The traffic could be seen, the whole island could almost be seen. From Central Park in the north, to the World Trade centre in the south, and bridges east and west linking the other boroughs. We were so high up and it was dark it was difficult to pick any detail out of anything. The viewing area was quite big at 15-20 metres squared. There were a couple of gift shops in the middle. Laura turned all romantic on me which was nice. I think she was hoping for a proposal. I think she thought if I was going to ask on holiday, here would be the place. Never mind eh Laura, I didn't disappoint in the end.</p><p>We returned back to earth, hungry. There was a Houghlihan's restaurant close by, which we entered and had a burger 'dinner'. Shattered from all the travelling and walking we made our way back to the hotel on foot where we crashed out.</p>

    <title>NY Trip - Bus tour, Central Park, Bloomingdales, Sony Experience, Rockefeller, Cinema</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had our bagels for breakfast and set off to buy our various bus tickets. We decided to go on a sightseeing bus tour, first taking the southern loop which took in the highlights of downtown Manhattan. To begin with it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. The bus was noisy so we couldn't hear the guide. It was also cramped and we seemed to be stuck in traffic all the time. However, we saw the other parts of New York. It looked as any other city as we travelled between mid-town and downtown. Then we began to come into China town and Little Italy. The roads were not in grid positions which strangely was a refreshing change. This area had a certain charm about it. A lot of old buildings. I was interested to hear the history of the oldest part of New York. We then reached the financial region, down at the southern tip. We stopped here for a short break. On the next stage we sat closer to the front where we could hear the guide, but nothing much he said was particularly interesting. In fact he kept going on about tipping him.</p><p>We were eventually dropped off at about 2pm at the Astoria Hotel and Central Park. The weather was fine and we decided to go for a walk in the famous park. The park is vast and was designed over 100 years ago. There are many characteristics to the park: hilly, ponds, flat, rocky, trees. We walked past a pond first, past an ice staking rink and sat by some rocks. There we wrote our postcards and rested for a while. We didn't go too far north. We exited to the east on to 5th Avenue. We looked at a more salubrious part of Manhattan. These streets were more quiet and there were many hotels as we dodged to Lexington Avenue.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_03_XX-NewYork65.jpg</src><caption>New York - Entrance To Central Park</caption></image><p>We found Bloomingdales which was huge, nicely presented, huge number of lines and some very expensive items. We also went into the Spy shop briefly and the Sony experience place which was free and we spent a couple of hours in there.</p><p>We found a diner in which to eat. I loved it. It was a typical diner with stools all along the serving bar and a huge mirror, so the vain could watch themselves eat. We couldn't afford much and embarrassingly gave a small tip.</p><p>On our way back we explored the Rockefeller building and watched part of the ice skating that was strangely there.</p><p>We de-toured and headed for a cinema in Time Square to watch 'Analyze This'. We wanted to see a film that hadn't reached our shores. We were so tired after this we wearily walked home.</p>

    <title>NY Trip - Wall Street, Woodbury Common</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today we went to a large discount retail park, Woodbury Common. However before that we caught the subway to go to Wall Street to see the Stock Exchange which is only open during the week. We queued for a while, but eventually got in to see the trading floor for about 15 minutes.</p><p>We then subbed it back to the other side of town to catch a bus from 42nd and 8th. The subway seemed to have more room inside the carriages to the London Underground. However, the stations themselves didn't seem to be a friendly place to be, with large cast iron black fences which reached to the ceiling and turnstiles designed in a similar fashion. It cost roughly 60p a ride. We rushed to queue for the bus only to find it was leaving 20 minutes later than advertised.</p><p>We left the city west into New Jersey. There was a lot of nothing on our 1/5 hour trip. There were many megastore type places and on one particular dual carriage way there was shop upon shop for about 10 miles. It was quite amazing. You have to drive to each shop. After a fair while the landscape turned hilly, rocky and green. It was a refreshing change to the bland, flat landscape previously.</p><p>We finally arrived at the 200+ shopping outlet for fashion stores rejects are unsold lines. I was expecting swarms of people like Camberley on a Saturday morning. However, it was very quiet. The sun was shining and we were ready to shop. It was fantastic. The prices were cheap, the shops were practically empty, the sun was shining. I had money set aside to spend and 'my honey' could carry all the bags for me!! No not that last bit.</p><p>I bought some Skechers for $40, some smart suit shoes from another place for a similar place, some large smelly candles (which I later found in England to be cheaper!), two pairs of Dockers chinos for $50 the pair. A Nike top reduced from $70 to $20, a Calvin Klien jumper at $15 and some Vans shorts for $5 each. I really wanted a black hat exactly like Greg Normans, but Laura wouldn't let me, and I had run out of money. I bought Laura a top as a consolation for her. We flukely caught an earlier bus back, but it stuck heavily of toxic smell. I almost passed out.</p><p>We walked with all our shopping to Planet Hollywood where we had a meal. This is something Laura wanted. I personally would have preferred somewhere else, especially as you could walk into one of these back in England. Again we wearily walked back to the hotel and flaked out.</p>

    <title>NY Trip - !! Marriage Proposal !! - World Trade Centre, Statue Of Liberty, Ellis Is, Brooklyn, Little Italy</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today was the big day. I wasn't nervous at all. I knew she would say "yes". I looked forward to making her happy. I guessed that her reaction would be one of excitement. Breakfast was a bit of a joke as we queued for half an hour. We had a busy day ahead of us. Again the weather was sunny, dry and getting warmer. I double checked the ring was with us as we left to head back towards the southern tip of the Island. We caught the subway again and headed for 'Clinton Castle' where we bought tickets for the 25 minute crossing to Liberty Island.</p><p>This area interested me the most as this where New York was colonised. The statue is the symbol of freedom and was donated by the French as was the first view that immigrants had of New York. The statue had in the past 10 years been cleaned up and renovated to its past glory. The boat was packed with tourists. The Island itself was packed and there was a 3 hour queue to Liberty herself. Having a full days schedule, we didn't have time to waste. There was a band and dancers performing which gave a really good atmosphere to the place. We ventured to the edge of the Island where there were spectacular views back to Manhattan. I was obsessed (well so Laura says) of getting some pictures of us, in front of the postcard scenery. We walked around Liberty to return to the queue for the 5 minute boat journey to Ellis Island.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_03_XX-NewYork72.jpg</src><caption>New York - Statue Of Liberty</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_03_XX-NewYork49.jpg</src><caption>New York - Our Picture Postcard</caption></image><p>Now this really did interest me (oh yes Norman!). It was difficult to capture any kind of atmosphere or resemblance of how it used to be, with 100's of thousands travelling through. Again there were many tourists here. We went to see an informative and interesting film about immigration and Ellie Island. Although it only last an hour, I was knackered and kept falling asleep even though I really wanted to watch it. We had a look around the exhibition for about half an hour but had to leave if we were going to fit everything in.</p><p>We returned to shore, caught a hot dog, and ate it looking over to the Island we had just visited. With my 'Norman' hat on, we followed a walk as described in the guide book. I read aloud as we walked. Laura couldn't believe how sad I was, but she loves me for it. We took in a lot of historic offices, a medium sized church that used to be a toilet building in New York, where George Washington was inaugurated. We then reached the World Trade Centre which is a collection of buildings but are famous for the twins towers that make New York's current tallest building. Again we queued for half and an hour or so. The lift took us quickly to the top floor. This time we were inside, but we could see all the way down as we could press our noses right on to the glass building. We had clear, spectacular views of the whole of Manhattan and could see much of Brooklyn. It was a beautiful sunny afternoon. Whilst we were up there we had to go on the helicopter ride simulator around Manhattan. We also had a drink in the cafeteria, before returning back to 'terra cotta' (as Del Boy would say)!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_03_XX-NewYork75.jpg</src><caption>New York - World Trade Centre</caption></image><p>We quickly exited and followed the guided walk around. We trundled along, but I started to get worried about the time. Although we were close to Brooklyn Bridge, I knew it would take a while to cross. We seamlessly made our way to the bridge, as the sun began to lower from the sky. I can remember the reflections on the buildings as we looked across. I was anxiously trying to pick out Brooklyn Heights, but I couldn't see it. Anyway, we eventually found the bridge footpath which runs above the traffic. It was a wooden walkway. Laura's feet were hurting from her shoes, so she took them off, which I gladly carried. As we walked across the sun was descending quickly as we admired the fantastic views of the buildings, the lights and the traffic. Half an hour later we reached the other side. I doubled checked that the ring was with me. I wasn't particularly nervous. I just wanted to ask her.</p><p>Once we reached the end we headed south. Laura knew we were going to the heights. We asked for directions and walked down a nice quiet residential street.</p><p>We finally made it. It was pretty dark by now which was a shame in some ways, but added to the atmosphere in others. The location was perfect, only a couple that were chatting to each other on a bench 40 yards away and one or two couples walking by. The atmosphere was relaxed and tranquil as the traffic could only be heard in the distance. We parked our bags on one of the rows of black, cast iron benches. Laura went to the railings to look across the water towards Manhattan. This was a chance for me to discretely set the video camera up and get the ring out. Now my adrenalin was flowing quickly. I went up to Laura, who still had her back turned. We kissed for a while and then got the ring box out, and so we were still close to each other presented the box, opened it, and asked "Will you marry me?" It was a bit of a blur after that, but I don't think I even got a 'yes' answer. She didn't even look at the ring. Instead I got crushed with a big hug. I could tell it took Laura aback, she was lost for words. There was a lot of feeling there. I felt glad on the one hand it was no longer a secret, the other happy that Laura was happy and happy myself for her wanting to spend the rest of our lives together.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_03_XX-NewYork56.jpg</src><caption>New York</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_03_XX-NewYork59.jpg</src><caption>New York</caption></image><p>We chatted back over Brooklyn Bridge about the whole setup and who knew. We walked to Little Italy where we found a restaurant to have a celebratory meal. Neither of us fancied champagne and to be honest felt like nothing had really changed. We still loved each other the same, still felt as close. I think this was the case as we both know what we wanted, we both wanted each other so much. I felt excited as we took a step closer to our goal of living together and marriage. We finished our meal and headed home early-ish as we had another exhausting day.</p>

    <title>NY Trip - Church</title>
    <info>
		<p>Sunday was our real last day. Laura wanted to go to church on this Palm Sunday. After breakfast we went searching for a church. There was a Serbian church opposite the hotel. I thought this is a bad place to go seeing that the Kosovo crisis had just began. We found a nice, big church near Lexington Avenue, but it began a little later. Just enough time for us to go off exploring the east side a little more. Lexington Park and Madison Avenue had a nice atmosphere about them. The lower numbered avenues were also nice and more refreshing than the busier west side. We hit first avenue and saw the UN building again.</p><p>We returned back to the church hurriedly (as someone was worried about the time). The service was much the same as in England. People seem to take it more seriously, dressing up, singing louder. The choir was excellent. We took communion and an hour and a half later exited the church and went to a diner like in Pulp Fiction for some lunch. We then headed to the bus station for the second half of our bus tour, Central Park and Harlem. This was much more enjoyable than the previous tour as the lady commentator was better and we had good seats. We saw where John Lennon was shot, the whole of Central Park and Harlem where it was spot the white man. The shops there were very cheap. Low quality clothing and electrical stuff. We got off early and wandered round the souvenir shops buying tacky things. Laura laughed at me for wanting to go in these shops. To be honest every shop did seem the same. We slowly walked back to the hotel via the westerly avenues. We stumbled across a massive sports complex in Chelsea. It was brilliant having an all sports arena from ice hockey to football to gymnastics. A separate are dedicated to each sport. There were also exclusive boats trips. We also looked at the local heliport nearby, but decided against a helicopter trip as we had seen enough. Walking through Chelsea I was pleasantly surprised what a nice area this looked. If I had to live in New York it would be here. We finally reached the hotel, packed our clothes and quickly walked back uptown to the Mars 2012 cafe, another of Laura's theme cafes.</p><p>This one surpassed the Rainforest cafe visit in terms of gimmicks. You don't book a table, you get a boarding pass for the shuttle flight. The flight attendant then introduces us to the cafe and then to our simulated flight. We then went to Mars where the bar was situated. It looked like something out of Star Wars. The prices had already been inflated to 2012 levels I think!! Our name was displayed on screen 20 minutes later which meant we could enter the restaurant area and eat. It was like being inside a huge cave or volcano. It was brilliant. The service was good and tables set apart from one another so you could have a private conversation. It was huge inside. Down to our last pennies we couldn't afford much. We even shared the drink. The meal was fine and after chatting and paying the waiter, we left for our last walk back to the hotel (free of bags this time).</p>

    <title>NY Trip - Homeward Bound</title>
    <info>
		<p>We rose very early to catch our return bus to JFK airport. We wanted to make sure we got there on time. We caught a tube to Grand Central station and then bussed it to terminal 7. Laura got really stressed at the bus driver as she thought we were going to be late. However, we arrived on time and had a little money for duty free. We were very disappointed with the three shops there. Poor selection.</p><p>We had something to eat before boarding. Again we watched a few films on the way back to pass the time quickly. Before we knew it, it was 10pm and Mum and Dad picked us up at Heathrow to drive us home.</p><p>A very enjoyable, if tiring holiday. We both had work on the Tuesday morning. We both didn't seem to suffer with Jet lag.</p>

However, after America, I'd seen enough shops, so didn't think much of it.</p><p>In the evening I returned back to David's for a boys night. It was the usual playing on the Playstation. That's getting a bit boring now.</p>

		<p>We again ventured over to Gravesend. We wanted to finally finalize which reception venue we would like. Every week that goes on restricts our options in terms of availability. There is about a 15-18 month wait time!</p><p>We began at the Stakis by Dartford Bridge, which was really nice, but a little too expensive for us. We tried to find the 'Mock Tudor Inn', in Greenhithe, but couldn't find it. We tried one in Gravesend, another near Chalk, and one small place in Cobham. However, none was as good as the Black Prince, Forte Hotel, Bexley.</p><p>We went Laura's grandparents in the late afternoon, where I almost fell asleep, exhausted from the morning. We headed back to Lau's for dinner before departing for the cinema in Rochester to watch Shakespeare In Love.</p>

    <title>Grove Quiz</title>
    <info>
		<p>Me and Lau went to Wokingham to shop for a present for Mum's birthday. Never really been to Wokingham before. It's quite a nice, small town. I found a 3 tier plant thing for her.</p><p>In the evening we went to the Grove School with Laura's mum's family for a quiz. Laura's parents could see we had a row, which I didn't like one bit. I want us to be seen as perfect couple on the outside. Anyway we made up quickly and enjoyed this very long quiz.</p>

    <title>Shrimptons Restaurant surprise</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura had a surprise restaurant trip planned. This time she had managed to keep the location quiet, well until we got lost anyway.</p><p>It was a quaint looking place just to the south of Haselmere. However, when we got inside, we were the only guests except one. It was a small place with just 8 or 9 tables. This unnerved Laura who moaned a bit. I didn't mind so much. I had the Thai style prawns which were a bit spicy hot, then Monk Fish on a bed of rice. The fish was salty, but the meal was nice. The rice especially was well done. An enjoyable, but different evening.</p>

		<p>We ventured up to Cambridge for the day. I don't know why Laura wanted to go there, but I agreed. It took us a fair while, but the weather was good and me and Laura were getting on like a house on fire.</p><p>I wasn't expecting much of Cambridge, but I was very wrong. It had a nice classical architecture, it was vibrant, full of students, it had nice parks, a market and nice shops. We had a really enjoyable time wandering around. We ended up in a park reading our magazines for an hour or so. We returned home mid-evening, bought a pizza from Sainsbury’s' on the way home, which we ate and then watched Match Of The Day.</p>

		<p>On Sunday I played football where I got my first ever booking for dissent. The referee was awful.</p><p>We had lunch around Mum and Dad's before venturing again over to Gravesend. We stayed at Lau's parents for a while, then went to the Black Prince with Lau's Dad, Mum, Grandma, Granddad, Charlotte, My Mum and Dad, Susan, Mark and Mormor. The purpose was to celebrate our engagement, to show the reception location, and discuss. We all got on very well in the pub a bit before hand, then when we ate our families settled in to two groups and defeated the purpose of the meeting. Never Mind. We slept around Laura's parents that night.</p>

		<p>Both me and Lau are very strapped for cash, especially with Lau's car potentially either needs a new engine or even a complete write off. She had gone home for a couple of days so I picked her up from Woking station and went for a quick drink in Woking's Litten Tree. We went home only to find we couldn't take the car over to Gravesend because automatics can't be towed for long distances.</p><p>Anyway we went to the Quays with Bazza for one of the nurses leaving do's. We're really becoming good friends with him. Nick and Martin and turned up later. They are now not moving in together. For the last 2 or 3 years they're moving out.</p>

    <title>Jas's Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura had an early on Saturday. I pottered around then went into Camberley with her to buy some nursing shoes.</p><p>In the evening we went to Jas's place in Guildford. There were a number of us. David showed his single mindedness and wanted to go out, while the rest of us wanted to stay in. Jas's flat was very nice. Over the last few weeks, Susan and Mark have split up as has Steve and Emma, Claire and Jon, and now Jas and 'boyf' Chris. It must be the season for it. Only Ellie and Michael have outlasted us.</p><p>We went to a couple of pubs, then David wanted to go on to a club. It was quite funny as the rest of us didn't want to go, but we were all too scared to say anything to him. We eventually ended up back at Jas's. We both felt very uncomfortable as they were doing funny substances.</p>

    <title>David and Alison’s Wedding</title>
    <info>
		<p>We booked a night in the hotel where the reception was held and decided to stay up in Nottingham for a couple of days. We drove Susan up and got there about 12 midday. Mum and dad left half an hour earlier but arrived at about 1:30pm. Typical.</p><p>The hotel was on the edge of a housing estate, in a country park. It was 3 star. The room was OK. I watched the lead up to the FA Cup final and the cricket, while we were getting ready.</p><p>The town Arnold, seemed a bit like the Ancell Estate. We three, got to the church not knowing anyone really. The service was nice. I felt admiration for the two of them. Lots of friends there, a bit of family, a sunny day and a lot of happiness and excitement.</p><p>After the service there were millions of photos that needed taking. We were included in the grooms half. We waived the two wedding cars off and proceeded back to the hotel for the reception. I managed to pop into our room once or twice to look at the football. We hung around for a while. Mum and Dad found it difficult to socialize, that's one thing I have learnt this weekend. I can see why we're not include with family that much. We were sat with some other Dixon's, cousins, a son and a great nephew of Grace's. They were quite posh, and I felt sorry for the mid 20's nephew who was a complete mummy's boy.</p><p>Terry, Alan's brother, didn't seem to mix in much either. I had a good time as did Laura. The speeches were good, and the best man's was relatively short. A lot of wine was left over, which we hid away for the evening do.</p><p>Mum, Dad and Susan left for home, while we were going to party. Me and Laura chatted most of the night, but I did get to speak to Lynda's aunt and mother. The disco was pumping out disco music mainly, to Laura's disappointment, but we still had a boogie. We didn't quite make it to the end. I was so tired, I collapsed and passed out on the bed. We'd finished that wine off.</p>

    <title>Sherwood Forest and Nottingham Camping</title>
    <info>
		<p>Sunday morning and I spookily didn't have a hangover. We went down for breakfast and met some of the other party go'ers. We waited for a while, then went to Dave and Ally's house with his parents to open some of their wedding presents. Well watch them open them. The house was a brilliant starter home. 4 bedrooms, nice street, 8 year old house for only £90K. It was really nice to be there watching them open the presents. They got loads. All nice as well. They had it all now.</p><p>The day was sunny and we left just after midday for Sherwood Forest. We walked around, looked at the visitor exhibition, then basked in the sunshine, listening to Radio 5, watching a local village cricket match with 'my woman' beside me. Bliss, bloody bliss. We traipsed around looking for a campsite, eventually found one, costing just £3.50. However, there were no showers. We set the tent up in 5 minutes, before driving on to Nottingham to look for the Cathedral. There is no Cathedral in the city. Well I thought it was a city! We found the main church instead and went for evensong. We then bought pie and chips and ate them in the town hall square, before returning to Calverton for a quick drink and then an early night off to bed.</p>

		<p>Because there were no showers, it was a priority to find some swimming baths. We went to Mansfield, had no luck there, but did find some in Chesterfield. After our swim we proceeded to Sheffield. A city much like any other. Nothing to go out the way for in the future it seems.</p><p>The weather had turned for the worse and we'd run out of money, so we thought we'd go and see Ellie back in Gravesend. After the long drive back we arrived early evening.</p>

    <title>Visiting William in Birmingham</title>
    <info>
		<p>We travelled up on Saturday afternoon and met Helen and Vicky on the way. A glorious sunshine morning, turned into a rainy, brummy afternoon. We met with Will and Phil and travelled back to his place. Now correct me if I am wrong, but I'm sure William had finished being a student. I think a student would even think twice about renting this place. The smell, the untidiness were something else. This provided great comedy, William being the butt of all jokes of course.</p><p>After jogging to the bank and back, we went into Will's local for a couple and played some pool. 'Quiet' Phil was an OK bloke who I could warm to. Will's friends seemed a bit dodgy. The words of the weekend were 'Who's your daddy', 'sweet as' and 'get amongst'. We went back had some dinner, then hit a pub before going to the 'dome' nightclub which was good.</p><p>However, Laura was very tired which spoilt things a bit. The taxi ride home was a bit of trauma. The mad Asian, drove very fast and at the same time hooted on to the bumper of the car in front. Shattered, we collapsed and fell asleep very quickly.</p>

		<p>After the previous two weekends of practically non-activity due to skintness and Laura working we decided to venture out this weekend. I'm currently in a furniture making mood at the moment, so we decided to go out and see some second hand furniture shops. We went to Aldershot, Cranleigh and another craft factory units village. Although we saw nothing, the weather was good and it was quite relaxing. It was Nick's birthday so in the evening we went to a Guildford pub called Roxboro's or somewhere close to the Friary centre anyway.</p>

    <title>Regents Canal Bike Ride</title>
    <info>
		<p>After Laura went to an early church service we went up to London for a bike ride along the Regent's Canal. We dumped the car at Limehouse and begun our cycle up the canal. Instead of the Regent's Canal we begun on the Limehouse Cut, which feeds into the River Lea. How we laughed! I mean who are the only people who could get lost on a canal, there's only one path! Having looked at the map and calming Laura down, I decided that we should continue up the river, turn off the Hertford Union canal and join the regent's Canal from there.</p><p>The cycling itself was very enjoyable. There were no hills to climb, instead Laura got off sometimes to go down them! There were a lot of fisherman as we raced alongside scrub lands, disused factories, flats and trendy apartments and houses.</p><p>Dad suggested to stop and look where Auntie Grace and Ada grew up in Dalston. It was a rough looking area and we eventually found 109 Hertford Road. It was quite a nice looking house. We went to the A10 and ordered two pizza's which we ate by the crossroads. By this time it was getting quite hot. Lau took a picture of me outside the house before we continued  westwards along the canal. At one point a kid chucked a bit of roll at me from the other side of the canal. Cheeky so and so. We made it through Islington until we came across the very long tunnel, which didn't have a tow path. We rejoined via Rodney Street! We went through Regent's Park after going through the busy Camden Town. we again were forced off the canal route by Lords cricket ground.</p><p>The World Cup Final was being played, Australia Vs Pakistan. As we were biking along a street to rejoin the canal, half a dozen Pakistani's were in a shouting match with some others who taunted at them about Australia winning. They ran at them and a fight was about to break out. Some 'authentic inner city violence'. However, someone calmed the situation down and they walked off!</p><p>We rejoined having gone through London Zoo and finally reached Little Venice. From there we had a break and rode to Hyde Park, went past Speakers Corner, down the side of Park Lane to Buckingham Palace, to Parliament, then followed the Thames path before returning to the car a bit wearily.</p><p>In the evening Laura went to Chiquitto's for Uncle Philip's birthday, whilst I played croquet with Dad. A very enjoyable day.</p>

    <title>Wimbledon - Camping in the queue</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was Laura's birthday treat to go to Wimbledon again this year. Even though the past two years have been disastrous, we hadn't lost any will for Laura's 23rd. In fact I think we were more determined. I've spent the last 2 or 3 weeks working hard on her picture frame present. After getting the number of years wrong on the Christmas Card I went one better and put Laura's age wrong down in her card. As small compensation I did realise before giving her the card..</p><p>I made sure the tent was all there on the Wednesday. I had planned to make some nice rolls so I bought some fresh after work on the Thursday. I made some bacon and cheese + tomato rolls, got a large tray of strawberries and a big bottle of orange. I raced to meet Laura, who had been wedding dress shopping, by Wimbledon stadium.</p><p>We parked very close to the tennis and decided to go down to the pub before joining the queue. We walked and walked and found a pub in Smallfields that wasn't packed out with tennis tourists. The pub was excellent, having a blues band jamming there. Even Laura got to like the noisy atmosphere. We stayed till closing time and took a different route back. We setup tent in the park and we were about the 800th people queuing. The weather was hot and dry for once with no clouds in the sky. Perfect! However, we had 3 or 4 scousers next to us who decided to stay up all night and cause commotion.</p>

    <title>Wimbledon - Laura's 23rd Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>On Laura's birthday we queued after an hour’s or two sleep to a blistering hot day. The scousers seemed a bit worse for wear. I put everything back in the car and moved it just up the road. I was surprised how close I was able to park considering.</p><p>The girls that the Liverpuddlians had chatted up, were rough looking which brought a smile to my face.</p><p>We had a choice of tickets. Centre court had just been sold out with Henman and Rusedski playing there. We plumped for court no. 2 after my persuasion, with Anna Kournikova first up. She's got a great body and legs, but she has a face like a spoilt brat, and she is miserable, so overall I'm still happy with Laura I suppose!!! ;) She's my babes.</p><p>We got in about mid-morning paying £23 for our seats each. We sat and had my rolls for breakfast by the impressive new court no.1. We decided to wonder around, until we found Steffi Graf warming up for her match with McEnroe later on. I don't want to sound like a pervert, but she's got nice legs to. She looked in great shape for the championship this year. the effort she puts in to each shot is staggering.</p><p>We then made our way over to the seats, where we found we had front row positions. Top banana. Just after midday the two players arrived. Was there a loud cheers for Anna or what. Wolf whistles the lot. To the opponents credit she smiled at all the attention Anna was given. Anna on the other hand looked miserable as sin. I was quite surprised how brown she actually was. I didn't think Russians got a tan. I had my camera poised, but was under the evil eye of Laura. There was a huddle of photographers there waiting for Anna. It's a bit sad really, all the men interested in her because of one thing only. Not because she is one of the world’s top players. I wonder if the day will come when we get bored of seeing her face and appreciate the tennis she plays.</p><p>The game lasted just over an hour with her opponent retiring, already one set up anyway. It was nice to watch our first game of tennis for two years! Next on court Laura got her own back because the supposedly good looking Mark Philippoussis was on. Now he had one mean serve on him.</p><p>We broke off for a rest to look around a bit. we were getting frazzled in the sun. We saw Henman play on Henman Hill, looking to the big screen by court no.1. He won.</p><p>I also saw Greg warming up for his match as well. We returned back to our seats later on in the afternoon to see a Briton pairing get knocked out. Now there's a surprise.</p><p>We returned to 'Henman Hill' to watch Greg play, before being worn down by the sun. Both wanting to get something to eat. Having enjoyed our day out, we rounded it off by some fish and chips in Berrylands on the way home.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_06_25-BirthdayAtWimbledon1.jpg</src><caption>Wimbledon Tennis</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_06_25-BirthdayAtWimbledon4.jpg</src><caption>Wimbledon Tennis</caption></image>

    <title>Croquet - Maidstone with Lau's Friends</title>
    <info>
		<p>I returned up the A3 to Surbiton to represent the club in the Longman Cup. I didn't play particularly well, but enjoyed basking in the sunshine, and we won in the end.</p><p>In the evening I trekked over to Gravesend to meet up with Laura's crowd for a night out in Maidstone. We went to Yates's and Strawberry Moons. It was so nice to see so many of Laura's friends collectively and getting on really well. It was the first time I had seen Jessica for absolutely ages, Fiona for 6 months or so, sane with Andrew. William was also down, being the fool as usual. A good night out.</p>

    <title>Adam's leaving do</title>
    <info>
		<p>Adam who sat next to me at work was leaving to work in the city. A pay increase from 19K to 23K. For the first time, Development were going out for a few drinks. Trouble is we had for than a few, ending up with myself, Adam, Steve Cassidy and Martyn. I was a bit out of my head, but apparently made everyone laugh. It ended up us leaving for the train station (trampling across the bushes along the way) only to find we had to wait half an hour. So we turned to the pub for more alcohol only to find it was shut of course. We then for some reason began walking into Fleet to find if an 'offy' was open. Once we reached the traffic lights however, we realized we needed to get back sharpish to catch our train. I was trying to avoid the guard so we went on the end carriage only to find he was there!! I began to walk purposely in the other direction, but of course didn't get too far, because it was the end carriage. Luckily I didn't get fined and was only charged £1.60.</p>

		<p>Laura had an early whilst I went out shopping with dad for wood. I wasn't too sure what I was going to make beforehand. I'm just a frustrated DIY'er with nothing planned. Dad suggested bed side tables, which I thought would be good.</p><p>We went over to Gravesend and helped set the quiz up that Laura's mum was running. Laura was in a foul mood, but cheered up later! Mum and dad came across for this one, and done us proud. They met Helen and Nigel and they thought Uncle Peter was a little strange.</p>

I got £15 in vouchers from both Barrie and James, and I got drink bought for me. I only had 5 or 6 Caffreys, but I paid for it later as I chucked up all over the place at home. Apparently I'm the loudest person when wrenching up.</p>

    <title>Martin's 24th Birthday - Don Beni's Italian</title>
    <info>
		<p>I had a croquet match arranged with Charles Bailey, and again I won. He was younger than me and he just graduated from Oxford. He was a nice chap with a plum in his mouth. We returned to have a scrumptious lunch, which meant smoked salmon. In the afternoon we went out in the scorching sun, 27C, in search for furniture shops. We went to furniture 2000 which was well over priced. We headed off to Reading, and on the way saw a couple of pine shops in Lower Early. One claimed to be second hand, but they were all new it seemed. Definitely one to go back to at a later date. The trouble is that we don't know what furniture to get because we don't know what the rooms are like. Also storage space is a bit of a premium. We scooted back to prepare for Laura's surprise dinner out.</p><p>By this stage I didn't know where I was going. Laura wore the lovely black dress that I got her at Christmas and she did look very stunning. Just thinking about her in it make me want to give her a big cuddle. She led me down by foot to Frimley station, caught the train to Egham. Fuggy wasn't working the late turn which was a shame. We got a taxi to Englefield Green and had a drink in the Barley Mow pub whilst watching the village cricket. Laura done her usual trick and couldn't remember where the restaurant was, even though she had made a special trip previously! It's difficult to get lost in the village of Englefield Green! I couldn't believe it! She asked a man where the restaurant was then comes back to me and says 'he's Italian too', which gave it away. The restaurant was down the same road as the green we were just at. How does she get it wrong? I was laughing as Lau was getting stressed at being late. Don Beni's was its name.</p><p>We both had a lovely starter as we sat outside. Al fresco style.  For my main I had a fish pasta selection, with cockles and muscles and prawns. I enjoyed it, but was getting a bit fed up at picking my way through it. It was very filling. Laura stuck to garlic bread and lasagne, how predictable. We walked back to the station. We had to wait 45 minutes at Ascot, so I called up Dad who took us home.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_07_10-EnglefieldGreenItalian2.jpg</src><caption>24th Birthday Meal in Englefield Green</caption></image>

    <title>Still looking for furniture</title>
    <info>
		<p>We began by looking around some car boot sales, but weren't very impressed, other than Spectrum stuff. We eventually had lunch at Laura's grandparents prepared by Laura. It was very nice, but we sat outside in the searing heat. She had put a lot of effort into the meal. I had prawns with a dip for starter, then some Italian potatoes in a sauce which was very filling. For pudding we had a raspberry ice cream sorbet which was the best pudding I've tasted. After watching the end of the British Grand Prix which Michael Schumacher had a bad shunt, we walked to the bust Frimley Green carnival.</p><p>In the evening we watched Live and Let Die.</p>

After a few games of pool I slid off home quickly, ate dinner, and went off with the whole family for the first time in ages, to Chertsey for the 'quiz de la musique'. It was quite a fun evening.</p>

    <title>New Star Wars Film and Met Graham for first time</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura had an early, whilst I played Andy Davies at croquet, and won. My break building was good, my hitting in was variable. I made lunch for Laura and I and Barrie came around for half an hour for a chat.</p><p>We went into Camberley to buy James's birthday present, a £15 gift voucher for WH Smiths. We rushed over to watch the new Star Wars film over in Bracknell. I haven't heard too many good things about it. There were 10 of us or so. I saw Nikki, David's girlie for the first time. She seemed quite outgoing. I loved the film, I think more because it was Star Wars rather than its content. I just love the different animals and droids, the light sabres and the fact it was a part of a bigger story.</p><p>After the film we scooted to Camberley's Litten Tree. It was happening there. Everyone enjoyed themselves. We ended up in Joe Bananas, which we couldn't really afford, but we got persuaded. We didn't buy a round that evening! and we came back potless. I danced quite a lot, but again, clubbing ain't my scene anymore. Barrie's Laura was off her head. We got on well as a four. We also met Susan's new fella Graham. He's Susan's age and a mechanic. Very outgoing. I just hope he treats her right.</p>

I'm doing this unaided, so I'm a little unsure if my design is any good. Even so, I'm enjoying the responsibility and experience. Roy has planned for me the archive problem, which means re-engineering code. This seems to be a grotty, although large and important job.</p><p>There are many people speaking of leaving the company mainly due to salary. The company better do something about it and fast otherwise it'll be too late. I or we have felt like mushrooms, not knowing anything. I'll be looking for around £20K to £22K minimum.</p>

All residential streets are permit only. We went to the pub beforehand. The show itself was very good. We were sure that some of the motorcyclists were going to collide as they criss-cross. It was good to see the gun race which is quite competitive. It lasted about 3 hours. My bottom ached on the uncomfortable seats.</p>

We wandered around the shops before doing the same in Christchurch.</p><p>We headed north to Brokenhurst, where we got the bikes out and saw some countryside on our way to Lyndhurst and back. It was a long ride (10 miles) and many hills, but I was chuffed at Laura enjoying it and making a great effort.</p><p>We returned home and picked up my car from its MOT (cost £260). In the evening we saw Austin Powers 2 and by coincidence sat behind Phil Rowe and Emma! the film was good and better than the first one. We returned to Farnborough finding that Laura had to move out by 10am!</p>

		<p>We frantically moved the rest of the stuff out to Laura's Grandmas. Someone came around the place to assess its condition. I'd put a lot of effort in and another row was brewing as Laura's attitude stunk! We made up and went into Camberley to look at mortgages and whether we could sort something with our Sorrento honeymoon. It was nice and relaxing.</p><p>After another BBQ we went bowling with my work at Pine Ridge. We walked there and arrived too late for the bowling. However, we had a good time chatting. We almost got chucked out after Robbie decided to spray Steve Cassidy with a load of Ketchup.</p>

    <title>Watford</title>
    <info>
		<p>I noticed I had a pay rise of 10% now making me on £19,250. I was hoping for a bit more. Laura had hers risen to £14,900.</p><p>In the morning we trundled off to Watford. The town centre seemed quite busy. Somewhere to return shopping one day, perhaps Christmas.</p><p>We went to look for a computer company to get a 4.3gb hard disk for £65. We then meandered our way to Hanwell to watch Chertsey win 4-1. We returned to watch A Life Less Ordinary on video.</p>

    <title>Margate Car Breakdown - Part I</title>
    <info>
		<p>Work so far this week has been pretty lack lustre. The 'pipe' work that was so urgent still hasn't moved any further and I was really missing Laura. I've never missed her so much. I felt lonely without her.</p><p>My craving for her happy face was so much so I decided to go and see her, by driving down to Margate to surprise her.</p><p>I trundled off at about 9am, but realized the temperature gauge on my car was on full whack. I limped off at Leatherhead and put it down to an empty water tank. However, the problem persisted, stopping every 10 or 15 miles or so for new water. I eventually made Margate at 1:30pm! Now where in Margate was Laura? The hotel they were staying at didn't know where, so I began searching the town, up and down the beach, in the amusement arcades, in the town, everywhere! I grew weary of walking and waited till around 4:30pm where I went to buy some flowers and prepared to wait at the hotel. They were already there! I left the flowers in the door way with a note saying something along the lines, 'I've been watching you and think you're really gorgeous. From another carer'. I got a hotel man to get Laura who found the flowers and the note. She went back to the chalet and laughed nervously with her mum. She caught me watching her and she was very pleased to see me. I met the three clients, we played pool and darts before I had to return home.</p><woops rating="6" woopstitle="Towed to a Hurse Garage at 3am!!"><p>After taking 4.5 hours getting to Margate, with the leaking water tank, I had the pleasurable task of getting home! Having reached Detling, just outside Maidstone, I could see grey clouds bellowing from my exhaust, as I was stopping in a garage the car stalled. I feared the worst, and thought it was some sought of seizure. It didn't sound right as I turned the car over.</p><p>I phoned dad who was at the football club to come and rescue me. At about 11:30pm (3.5 hours after I left Margate) he arrived. We tied up some blue rope and I was in my own car, making sure bit bumping into Dad. The rope only gave a maximum of one car length between us, and guess what we pulled out and the first hill was saw had an 11% sign!! It wasn't a nice experience as the rope kept slackening and then yanking and because the servos on the brakes weren't as good as usual I was afraid of going into the back of the 'tank' (dads car).</p><p>However, we never came close. We stopped shortly afterwards. Dad was ready to set off again but I hadn't put the key in the ignition to unlock the steering wheel yet! So I slammed on the brakes whilst I frantically looked for the key. Dad was struggling to set off, revving up his car. Luckily I found it quickly in my pocket and we were off again.</p><p>Another big problem was that in order to preserve my battery, I switched off my lights in lit areas. This made it difficult at times to see 'the tank'. The rope finally snapped in Maidstone. We stopped and someone got us a proper tow rope, and off we went again.</p><p>The lights began to dim, and I was getting extremely tired. We eventually stopped in a garage in Riverhead, Sevenoaks and we got home at 3am! Unknown to us we dumped the car in a Hurse garage. A fitting end. I had managed to buckle the cylinders, but of course they were just about OK to be fixed and a week later I was back on the road.</p></woops>

		<p>Took another day off work in order to get the car sorted. The garage we parked at was for Hurses and limo's. We towed it to a back street garage close by. It'll be a few hundred pounds they suspect. There goes my back pay.</p><p>In the evening Dad and I went down the snooker hall to play a few frames.</p>

We tried the 'Stilton Dish' in Hartley Witney, but it was closed for some strange reason.</p><p>We drove to Farnham and found a Cafe Uno, which is an Italian style restaurant. We had a nice chat, the food was OK and wine good. We came back relatively early, and had an early night.</p>

    <title>Sam West's Wedding</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning I had aches and pains everywhere. On Thursday I went to my first football training session in months. I've never had so much aching muscles. We had planned swimming but none of us were up for that. Instead we browsed around Camberley and got our Sorrento book.</p><p>After lunch we went to Barrie's sister's, Sam, wedding. I don't know her really. I think it is the first time I had seen Barrie and James in a suit. The wedding was at St Andrews, Frimley Green, and seemed a low key affair. There weren't many in their 20's attending.</p><p>After the wedding we went over to a new housing estate in Ash Vale. We enquired about prices, stating that we wanted a 2 bedroom property. She said 'our cheapest is £120,000'.Good golly gulp. We looked around anyway. Nothing close to our 90-95K mark.</p><p>In the evening we drove to Great Fosters, near Egham where the evening do was for the wedding. It was an idyllic setting. A big country house with landscaped gardens. Barrie and James both had rooms for them and their respective partners, Laura and Emma. The party kicked off with Nick and Martin arriving with James's parents. Nick and Emma were chatting each other up and left halfway through the evening. Martin who was also after Emma I think, looked a bit put out. Poor old James wondered where the pair ended up. They ended up in James's room all night. Gutting for James as he was really fond of her. I'm not sure what they were up to., knowing how much James would be hurt. That was a dampener on things. The evening otherwise was a success. Laura drank too much, but danced loads. The evening ended in James finding, what eventually would be his new girlfriend, called EMMA, and me ringing dad up for a lift home. He was brilliant to do this.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_08_14-SamWestWedding1.jpg</src><caption>Sam and Stuart's Wedding</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_08_14-SamWestWedding2.jpg</src><caption>Sam and Stuart's Wedding</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_08_14-SamWestWedding4.jpg</src><caption>Sam and Stuart's Wedding</caption></image>

    <title>Medway Croquet</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had an early start. Laura had a major hangover which I wasn't surprised about. She was off for another family trip , this time sailing up the Essex coast. I was to play croquet in Maidstone. Andy Davies was kind enough to drop Laura off at her house. We got to Maidstone for the 10:15 start. The lawn was undulating and patchy. After a nervous start my play reached average. I'd lost both games, one due to my partner, the other was down to a bit of unluckiness. Just as we were about to leave I saw Laura's parents friend, Stan. He was there for the bowling. It's a small world.</p><p>Dad and I went off to collect Laura's car from Great Fosters, then flaked out in the evening.</p>

    <title>Hitting Mikes Car</title>
    <info>
		<p>This was my only evening in this week, so I decided to continue with the bed side tables.</p><woops woopstitle="Hit Next Door Neighbours Car" rating="7"><p>I needed to move Laura's car which was parked in front of the garage. Being casual I used my left foot and subconsciously counted two pedals in from the left. However, because it is an automatic I hit the accelerator and not the brake! The car door was wide open and it smacked into the next door neighbours car! Luckily dad's car wasn't behind. There was no damage to Lau's car but I had made a big dent and scratch in Mike's car!</p></woops><p>Flustered that I was, I quickly drove away. Nobody else seemed to see this happen. I drove to think whether or not I should tell him. At this stage I wasn't too sure where the dent was. If it was by the passenger door, then it would be noticeable as the door wouldn't open cleanly. I decided not to say anything. He wouldn't notice it was there for a while as it was on the passenger side and how on earth could I have smacked it. The cause of events seemed hard to believe. Also I park Laura's car on the road 9/10 times, so I don't think I'll be suspected. They are also moving soon and it wouldn't take much to touch up the scratch. I calmed down and done my wood working until dusk.</p>

    <title>Adam's - Clapham Clubbing</title>
    <info>
		<p>I had managed to organise a trip out with some of the department. Myself, Martyn, David and Peter went up to Adams in Clapham. It was a bit more nerve racking as I had organised this, and we'd never done it before.  I drove up, but Adam wasn't in. We were let in by his brother. It was quite exciting really. We went out to Pizza Express then into a number of pubs. It was such a good atmosphere up there. Bars that spilled onto the streets. trendy, nice looking, not traditional. The conversation flowed most of the time. We discussed what money we were on. Everyone was disgusted at the promises that were made to them.</p><p>Adam, Martyn and I stayed on for a bit of clubbing at the 'Clapham Grand', with all its 10 foot high leopard skin doors on of course Dr. Glitz on a 10 foot high stage. Surreal, but cool. We stayed till 3am, completely drunk. We got back to Adams and I gave some generous helpings of Vodka and orange. A good night out.</p><p>Laura had returned from holiday and gone to London to see Mama Mia.</p>

Famous faces were supposed to be there. We only saw an Elton John look alike. We all had a pound on each of the six or seven races. None of us won anything! It was the first time that Char and Laura had gone to the races. I did enjoy it.</p><p>We had a romantic evening with a pasta, wine, opera, candle lit dinner in the front room. The video we hired got chewed up in the recorder. We watched Match Of The Day instead.</p>

Laura asked Karen to do our reading for our wedding, without even asking me if that was OK, which didn't please me in the slightest. Not because it was Karen, just the fact that she didn't even consult me on something which is important for us. We had a big row about it, but later made up.</p>

I was mainly black people there who were dancing to their kind of music. It was great as everyone was happy. It was a good party atmosphere. Eventually we had to go back. I needed to collect Laura from work. There were 100's of thousands of people to wade through. I eventually made it back home.</p>

That was the plan anyway.</p><p>We cycled and cycled, stopped and cycled. Laura was scared of a few cows and a few dogs. We never actually reached Woking. We ended up at the junction with the Basingstoke Canal, in Byfleet. Oh dear! We made the long trip back again, going down the canal to Woking, then getting on the A320 back to Guildford. We stopped for a lovely meal and paid for just the cheapest! We cycled back to the car in the dark, and then eventually got back home! Mum and Dad returned back from their holiday on Tuesday.</p>

		<p>I had a phone call from the garage to say that my car now starts. OK - but it still overheats, possibly due to a small crack in the engine and it would need a new engine in order to fix it. In other words a write off. I was a bit angry and confused what to do, but eventually decided to give up the idea of having a car. However, come Thursday morning the garage rang up and said it was the thermostat that was broken and the everything was OK. The total bill was £291. Me and dad collected the car that evening.</p>

    <title>Mortgage Consultants</title>
    <info>
		<p>A couple of mortgage consultants came round from Pearl. They were a bit disappointing because they didn't give much on mortgage lenders, instead a lot on what they sell themselves. Still I understand "mortgages" a lot more now.</p>

    <info>
		<p>In the morning I was supposed to play croquet, but because all of the rain there were puddles on the lawn. We instead headed into Woking and put our names down on more mailing lists. You seemed to be able to get more for your money around there. Bisley looks a good bet. We also got one or two things for the house. Laura had work, whilst I went over to Leatherhead to watch Chertsey play. It was a spirited 1-1 draw. In the evening I went over to David's and one of his gatherings. It was quite good fun.</p>

    <title>First house viewing</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had an early-ish start as we were going to see our first house. The estate agent had told us a few porkies. 19 Devonshire Avenue, Sheerwater. A bit of a dump really. The worst thing was it being on a tacky council estate. We lasted less than 10 minutes there. I felt quite embarrassed as you have to go around pretending you're half interested. We went from there to Colchester via London! Big mistake. Over 3 hours later we arrived and eventually found somewhere to park. We had a look around the shops and some things for the kitchen. Mr. Silly and Little Miss Scatterbrain, and believe it or not a talking / singing Christmas tree. We then headed off to the leisure pool for some spa-bathing, Jacuzzi, sauna' ring and steam baths.</p>

    <title>First Viewing Of 82 London Road, Bagshot</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we looked round 82 London Road, Bagshot with the estate agent, Sally. We both loved it. It had a good character to the place and was well decorated.</p><ul><li><i>front room</i>You step through the front door, straight into the front room. It had a fireplace for Laura and a dining room table.
        </li><li><i>upstairs</i>Upstairs via the winding stairs were two smallish bedrooms. Amazingly the triple glazing keeps the noise out very well. A bit noisier downstairs though.
        </li><li><i>garden</i>Out the back was a 100ft garden in good order. Most importantly I could imagine us in here. I wanted to be here.
        </li></ul><p>In the evening the whole family went out. I prepared a pizza meal for Laura and made my bedroom up to have a romantic candle lit dinner. I surprised Laura by giving her a couple of "The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe" tickets for the Royal Shakespeare Theatre production in Stratford Upon Avon.</p>

Watched football down the pub in the afternoon and that had a Danish evening where we had a big meal with 8 of us, and played the dice game.</p>

I hadn't realized that it was over 14 months since we last been down. Anyway we got on well with them. Linda was impressed by Laura's religious background. We then went off to Deal for a walk along the beach, then through country roads to a place called Martin. We returned to Gravesend, where some of Laura's family were there. After watching some tele, we returned home.</p>

Anyway we won the game on penalties.</p><p>In the afternoon we had a little drive to Loosely park and back. Couldn't afford to go in.

    <title>Croquet Final, Surveyors Report</title>

		<p>We got the surveyors report through. There were quite a few things reported that needed urgent attention. They included:</p><ul><li>Repair and replace window frame in the bathroom</li><li>Upgrade insulation in the roof space.</li><li>Re Cover the main roof.</li><li>Build up or complete the party walls in the loft.</li><li>Overhaul/Repair the rear gutter and replace the front down pipe rainwater fitting.</li><li>Repoint the front walls.</li></ul><p>So we are going to see if they'll drop the price and let Barrie's dad come round to give us a quote on some of the required work. It seems a bit 50/50 now whether we'll get the house or not now. However, the sellers, must be a bit worried. I feel for them.</p><p>Still I had a croquet final to play against Michael Hague over in Surbiton. I played miserably and lost. Never mind. We decided to have a pizza for lunch, then made our way to Kingston. However, I wasn't in shopping mood much. We didn't buy anything and made our way back to have a quiet evening in.</p><p>I got up at 5am in the morning to watch the final Grand Prix. Mikka Hakinen won the title in the end.</p>

		<p>We set off at about 10:30 for Ongar Leisure centre. I took my collage along. It was better organised this year. It had the usual long serving table, where you could buy a lot of merchandise if you were the avid fan. I am 'an avid' fan so bought; Christmas Tree's video, Series 6 videos, book of scripts from series 1 to 4, a TV secret location book, a CD of 'Fools' music and Laura bought me an alarm clock and we're supposed to be saving for a house! We queued for 2 - 2 1/2 hours to get Sue Holderness (Marlene), Pat Murray (Mickey Pearce), Roy Heather (Sid), and Ken MacDonald (Mike) autographs. They were all brilliant, had real enthusiasm for us all. We drove back at about 6pm exhausted but thoroughly happy of the weekend's activities.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_10_31-OFAHConventionAll.jpg</src><caption>Fools and Horses Convention</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_10_31-OFAHConventionMarlene2.jpg</src><caption>Marlene - Fools and Horses Convention</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/1999/1999_10_31-OFAHConventionSid.jpg</src><caption>Sid - Fools and Horses Convention</caption></image>

We went over to Laura's grandparents in Lee and had a quick chat before we hooked up with Renaud at his house. We walked up to the Blackheath firework display, no bonfire. As the same as last year it was quite impressive. The traffic trying to get out was horrific, we dropped Ren off and returned to the Grandparents before, dropping off the girls at Gravesend.</p>

    <title>Stratford Upon Avon - Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe</title>
    <info>
		<p>My car has still got battery problems, so Laura drove up to Stratford in the morning. We almost ended up in Stafford, due to someone's map reading skills confusing the likes of Stratford and Stafford! We stopped off on the way for a spot of bacon sarnie lunch. We surprisingly found the hotel easily. The Moat House was 4 star and very plush inside. A large elegant reception area, with a grand hall, a restaurant area a couple of bars, a relaxing area where there were comfy chairs looking on to the River Avon. We checked in, and went straight to the room. It was very nice. A large, I say large double bed for hurgles, a nice bathroom, although someone again blocked the toilet very easily and Sky TV! The only downside was a poor view, but that didn't matter, all the viewing I needed was of Laura. After checking the springs out, we unpacked, and went for a walk in town. I really liked the atmosphere of the town. I was relaxed, the weather was wintry, but dry and we had the afternoon to do nothing. We wandered back to prepare for the theatre. Laura found my letter to her which she really appreciated. I'm glad because I spent a lot of effort and money on it. Laura wore her very fetching 'mermaid' dress. I wore a white shirt of course. We went to a nearby pub, where we had a pleasant meal before the early evening show of 'The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe'. I got us excellent seats, 3 rows in. I didn't even fall asleep, I enjoyed the production so much! I got Laura a surprise Yorkie bar at the break. Afterwards, although still relatively early, we made the 2 minute walk back to the hotel.</p>

    <title>Stratford Upon Avon</title>
    <info>
		<p>We made it down for a 10 o'clock breakfast. Fill your plate with as much as you like. I had a fully, fully fried big breakfast and some grapefruit and Satsuma to boot. We went to read the ordered Telegraph in the Relax area. Oh yes my son, this is how to live. I even let myself (and Laura did as well) go and put a bet on later. Heavenly. We went to town and ordered our James Bond - The World Is Not Enough tickets. We also needed to buy some toiletries after someone forgot them. We meandered back and then went to the health suite area for a long swim, Jacuzzi, sauna and steam room. Went back to the room to relax, once more. We went for a long walk around the town and ate in a Bella Pasta before going to see the Bond Movie. There were scenes on the Thames which I loved. It was a good film. Still I like Golden Eye the most. We went to a pub then quickly back to the hotel.</p>

    <title>Danish Church Christmas Bizarre</title>
    <info>
		<p>We got up early and had breakfast before scooting back down to London for the Danish Church Christmas bazaar. We had to navigate ourselves through memory and got a little lost by Swiss Cottage, not our fault though. Poorly sign posted. There was a Danish atmosphere about the place. There were craft stalls and they were quite expensive. Laura even had a Danish coffee and she liked it! We also had a pølser with all the trimmings. Scrummy. A very enjoyable weekend overall.</p>

    <title>The 'Jumping Out On The Limp Man' Story</title>
    <info>
		<woops rating="6" woopstitle="Jumping Out On The Limp Man"><p>We went out with Nick and Martin, for a pub crawl around Wokingham. We walked to Nick's and then to Farnborough North where we popped in to the local there and had a quick pint, then caught a train. Our mission was to drink one pint every half an hour.</p><p>The first pub we walked to I saw Ian Wales in there, who had just been made redundant. I felt really sorry for him as there was no explanation for his departure. That kind of feeling that I'll never see him again as well. We carried on regardless. We visited another three or four pubs. One of them a guy had blood all over him and it seemed he'd only been punched 5 minutes before. We quickly got out of there.</p><p>We caught the train back and walked along the Hatches. Me and Lau walked on ahead. Nick and Martin tried to out flank us. However, they didn't realize there was a man with a bad boy limp in front of us. It was very dark. Suddenly Nick jumped out and shouted to scare us. However, he jumped out on the wrong person. Needless to say the bad boy limp man walked off fairly sharpish! It was very funny. One of those, you had to be there incidents.</p></woops><p>We walked all the way home. However, with an upset tummy I managed to speckle the bedroom carpet and wall as well as the landing carpet. Whoops!</p>

Stereophonics had some great tunes but they lacked to put on a show. Wembley Arena was a very big hall with seating around the edges and standing in the middle. It lasted just under 2 hours without a break. We made it home back late.</p>

The room was amazing, facing the Strand 4 floors up, with air conditioning, a safe, a big TV and a desk, sofa, the works!!</p><p>It was a murder mystery evening where there were 4 or 5 actors. We had drinks, before sitting down for a meal. Steve and Paul were ratted and heckled the actors. The disco went long into the night. We retired at about 2am.</p>

We visited the timekeeper zone, rest zone, Rally School racing game, the mind zone, the journey zone, the talk zone, the performance and saw the millennium version of Blackadder which was by far the highlight of the day.</p>

    <title>Destination 2000 and The Griffin</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went up with Nick and Martin to the Holiday Show at Olympia. It wasn't good as previous years. I think the novelty has worn off. I would still would love to go on a cycling holiday somewhere hot and scenic. We trundled off to a pub for lunch and went on a bus journey to Bow and Stratford, whilst the boys went to Chelsea V Wimbledon</p><p>We met up in the evening at Trafalgar Square and went to a restaurant in Leicester Square for a meal and cocktails.</p><p>We then met up with all Laura's friends at the Griffin.</p>

		<p>Laura very kindly invited me over for dinner. She had made a good effort with her fine Italian Restaurant. I had mushrooms for a starter, spaghetti for main, and Ice Cream with Cappuccino. Laura gave me a nice t-shirt and I gave Laura an underwear set and a Britney Spears tape and CD. I felt honoured and pleased that Laura went to some effort.</p>

I thought it had it. With a little trouble I managed to get it out in the end. I made spaghetti bolognese, then went shopping to Sainsbury's.</p>

    <title>Tunbridge Wells Half Marathon</title>
    <info>
		<p>Oh dear. No real training done in preparation. However, I'm confident of finishing. I was doing the run with Andrew and George who are fitness fanatics and tri-athletes. George's brother also came along... guess what also very fit. I turned up at the school at 9:20 thinking the race began at 10am. It in fact started at 10:30. I was new to this. I signed in a paid 10 quid. In return I got a number to pin onto my t-shirt. There was quite a bit of hanging around. We chatted about running and fitness.</p><p>It was something I could get into. There were about a 1000 entrants, about 900 more than I thought there would be. We jogged to the start. It was a coolish, windy day, but conditions weren't too bad. The gun went off and we... walked for the first 30 seconds. We broke into a trot then a run. Andrew and George's brother immediately stormed off. My tactic was to stick with George. Within the first couple of miles I could sense that my calves were tightening up.  It bothered me a bit, but continued.</p><p>After 3 or 4 miles, I lagged behind George but I kept in contact for the following 3 or 4 miles and eventually overtook her. There were quite a few hills, one of them over a mile long. After about 7 miles my calf was really hurting and actually made it difficult to run I could also feel my left foot split open. The final 5 or so was a real struggle. I made it to the 10 mile mark and then had to slow to a walk. I was in real agony and for a split second contemplated giving up. I battled on and thanks to encouragement from the crowd, stewards and other runners. I made it to the town centre. The encouragement really helped I stopped just after the 11 mile and 12 miles markers. My finishing time was 2 hours 19 minutes..... and I was dead.</p><p>I got a medal which I am very proud of and looked at the damage to my feet. Andrew laughed. My sock was blood ridden. I could barely walk. I got driven back to my car and I wearily went home.</p><ul><li><i>Georges brother</i>1hr 28 minutes
        </li><li><i>Andrew</i>1hr 35 minutes
        </li><li><i>George</i>1hr 55 minutes
        </li></ul><p>I really enjoyed it funnily enough and has spurred me on to do more. My target now is to beat the 2 hour barrier.</p>

Instead we went to Bodium Castle then on to Tunbridge Wells where we drove round the long, drooling course I completed a week ago.

    <title>Claire and James Praggasen Wedding</title>
    <info>
		<p>Finally Claire was getting married and was happy. I'd been out with James a few time before, but I still can't believe it's not Jon. Anyway I drove down and we booked in to a nice B+B, just outside Wells, which was a lovely small city. We arrived early and sat in the church for quite a while before the service. Trouble was I didn't know anyone else and wondered if we were at the right place!</p><p>It was a sunny day and Claire eventually got down the aisle and done the business. It was a strange service. I think mainly due to the humorous roman catholic vicar. Photos were taken by the Cathedral so we all walked over there. The reception held close by. It was a bit awkward again as we didn't know anyone other than Becky who was bridesmaid. We sat down for the meal with a load of James friends. It was the only table he had out of the 9 or 10.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_03_XX-ClaireJamesWedding.jpg</src><caption>Claire and James wedding</caption></image><p>They were easy to chat to and we had a good laugh. Afterwards we congregated upstairs for the best mans speech.</p><p>Dan and Karen turned up in the evening for the disco. It was good to see them again and we got on well. He was the same as ever. Drinks like a fish. We stayed till the end, briefly speaking to Claire and James. Karen and Dan came back with us as they stayed at the same hotel.</p>

    <title>Fleet Half Marathon</title>
    <info>
		<p>Again I hadn't done much training, but I started off confidently and felt good. My legs and feet were in good condition. I confidently went past the 7 mile mark. At 8, I began to slow. I went past Laura at 9 still confident in finishing. However, come 9.5 miles all of a sudden I struggled...badly. It was a hot, dry day and I started to feel dizzy. I walked most of the last 3 miles and still finished better than last time in 2hrs 15mins. I remember getting overtaken on the home straight by a man with a false leg! I got a second medal! My neck was sore all week after that.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_03_19-FleetHalfMarathon.jpg</src><caption>Fleet Half Marathon</caption></image>

		<p>Not much happened over the weekend. We went to see Andrew and George on the Friday. I am extremely skint. I went to the flicks with David H during the week. Sunday we played at Farnham Park and lost 2-1. However, I scored. Matey was bringing the ball out of defence and I anticipated his move and tackled him, ran forward 20 yards, saw the keeper off his line a fraction and chipped the ball into the far top corner. A peach my son.</p>

    <title>Engagement Anniversary</title>
    <info>
		<p>1 year and 1 day in and Laura organised a surprise outing. We began walking to Frimley, through the town, past the road to the station. I thought where are we going? There was nowhere else. We went down the steps to the station over the bridge where she stopped and proposed to me giving me a watch. A stopwatch! It was very sweet. I had to imagine the bridge as Brooklyn.... a bit different to Frimley Railway station! We then went to the Italian Villa Bianca via the White Hart. It was a great atmosphere and good food. An enjoyable evening. The watch wasn't bad as well!</p>

    <info>
		<p>I took the day off work, legitimately, and we went to the ideal home exhibition, hoping for some inspiration and ideas for the house.</p><p>We took the train up from Woking. We were a bit disappointed with the ground floor as it was more of a sales fair with just furniture, not colours, room layouts, ideas, etc.. We went upstairs and although it wasn't what we were looking for. We enjoyed the food and drink stalls and nik-naks. In the end we bought 6 frosted glasses, a rug, a candle, a 3D picture of a kitchen and a chess set. We left tired and happy with our haul.</p>

We then went on to watch a good game and 1-0 result.</p><p>We tootled off to Gravesend right round the north circular and via the Woolwich ferry. Had an early night.</p>

		<p>We drove up to Newham Leisure centre. Frank Bruno was running and an 88 year old woman! A warm up lap around the running track didn't make me feel very confident, my legs were like lead. Anyway, this made me run slower and this time I completed the course without stopping to walk. I ran past 10 miles in 1:30 minutes. I was on target for 2 hours. However, I took on water, which made my legs heavy again. I finished in 2 hours 5 minutes. I was pleased that I hadn't stopped. It took an hour to get out of the car park and I rested for the rest of the day.</p>

Turned Laura right off, but I loved seeing the range of gourmet foods. We headed up and down the high street, but didn't think much of it. At lunchtime we went over to Canterbury and had fish and chips. Again we wandered along the shops and bought some Mr Men. There were  plenty of foreigners there. We drove back to Frimley that evening.</p>

I bought an Adidas marathon cap which I was pleased with.</p><p>I then made my way to Peckham to meet up with Renaud. We went off to watch Leyton Orient v Chester City. A bit of a bottom of the table clash. Anyway someone came up to us just outside the ground and gave us 2 complimentary tickets. Result! Saved us £20 each.</p><p>We both enjoyed watching the game. Chester won 2-1. We made our way back quickly as I had to be over at Lau's grandparents for dinner. Not quite pasta'ing it up, which I was worried about. I had an early night, sleeping over at Lau's grandparents.</p>

    <title>London Marathon</title>
    <info>
		<p>I was quite nervous about the day and I had to be happy with my preparation. I didn't want to think I failed because I didn't prepare how I wanted to. I had a big bowl of porridge for breakfast and trotted down the paper shop to get Lau's grandpop a paper. I wanted to make sure I was properly warmed up and felt loose. We left at about 8:15 and drove to Blackheath and got there about 8:30.</p><p>There were lots of people, not many drove it seemed. Plenty of warming up, going to the toilet. It was one of the warmest days of the year and sunny. There was a great friendly, nervous atmosphere, with helicopters floating about. Martin and Dad rang me up just before the race to wish me good luck. Laura was there to support me. We kept shuffling forward as 9am approached. Loads of people got rid of their sweatshirts and just lobbed them to the side. I didn't even know the race had started. It wasn't until 9:15 until I crossed the start line!</p><p>I took it very easy to begin with, and enjoyed it. It was great with the cheering crowds. My nervous tension meant I had to go to the toilet after the first 3 miles. The pace was effortless, but slow. At 3 miles we joined with the other starters and booed at them. It was a great atmosphere. At this point you could appreciate the enormity of the volume of people.</p><p>The first milestone point was at the Cutty Sark (7 miles) where Laura waited for me. It must have taken me an hour to get there. There were so many people watching, I didn't see Lau. We had agreed to see each other a mile or so on, so from then on I was just looking at the crowd, but couldn't see her or my parents, who said they must have just missed me.</p><p>Anyway come the 8/9 mile marker in Bermondsey, the marathon really began. The honeymoon period was over. The crowds were sparse and competitors a bit more concentrated. This is where the mental side began for me to tell myself to keep going. I just kept at my own pace. I reached Tower Bridge and I picked up with all the crowds. I felt a bit sad that I hadn't seen anyone and consigned myself not to seeing anyone as how would they know where I was?</p><p>Half way was reached in 2:15 minutes which I was pleased at. I thought from here onwards was the most I or any of my friends had run. We saw all the runners coming back who had done 21/22 miles. I just could not comprehend running that fast. I quickly tired, and went to the toilet up a side street, I also stopped for a minute at 14 miles. I felt so disappointed in myself, but I felt light headed. I thought I was in need of sugar. 30 seconds late I began again. Luckily kids were handing out Jelly Babies and sweets. I grabbed them. My health improved again and I felt mentally very positive again, even though my body wasn't.</p><p>Many people had stopped to walk at 15 miles, so it felt good overtaking a lot of people. I kept going like this for another 5/6 miles. I saw Laura by Marsh Wall (I think) which was really nice. I hope she was proud of me. I enjoyed this part as the scenery was different and I was proud of myself for keeping running, wondering where I got my stamina from.</p><p>At 20 miles I was struggling again and felt hungry. I saw mum and dad for the first time. Mum looked really proud of me. I asked for food. Eventually I got a Frusli bar (oat bar) and a banana off them. They had to run after me to give it to me, which was quite funny.</p><p>On exiting the Isle Of Dogs I felt I was on the last lap and all I had to do is keep going and not stop. I saw runners coming the other way, who had only done 14 miles. I felt poor sods. Although still positive in thought, my body just couldn't do much more. Nothing really hurt, just my legs couldn't do much more. I ran under Tower Bridge (22 miles), but had to start walking where the cobbled street came. I tried to start again, but really couldn't. I think I was up to about 4hrs 15mins at this point. I couldn't even walk fast! Other walkers were overtaking me! The crowds were still there.</p><p>At 24/25 miles I kept coming over all emotional. Sort of crying. I don't know what that was all about. I got to parliament and the crowds were massive. I saw Susan and Graham and was able to jog again, down Birdcage Walk. This was a bit of luck as Mum and Dad were 50 yards further up with the camcorder, making it look like I'd run all the way! I turned past Bucking Palace and ran past the finish line. I felt proud and happy with myself. My official time was 5hrs 35mins, but I take the 15 minutes off to give myself 5hrs 20mins. I got my medal and someone took my chip off my shoes. I couldn't sit down, I had to make my way to the end of the Mall. Susan and Graham were by the fence. Laura was at the end, by this stage it was difficult to walk.</p><p>Lau and I went over to the Foreign Press Association offices between the Mall and Pall Mall. There I had some much needed food and a 20/30 minute massage. It was nice, but I am not sure it really helped. The masseur on the next table was a fit blonde. Probably a good idea she didn't get me. Phwoaarr.</p><p>We struggled to Charing Cross via Piccadilly Circus. We eventually made it back to Lee, although Laura couldn't find the car! I then drove home and rested for the rest of the day. Went to work as normal the following day.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_04_XX-LondonMarathon07.jpg</src><caption>London Marathon</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_04_XX-LondonMarathon08.jpg</src><caption>London Marathon</caption></image><p>As I was running for the Anthony Nolan trust, we managed to go up to get a sandwich in one of their building that they had hired out. We finally got back to the car and drove home. I did manage to go to work the next day!!</p>

		<p>Drew 1-1 with Rushmoor Saints. During the game I got fouled in the middle of the park, and the guy took exception to me going down. As I was on the floor he started kicking me! To protect myself I curled up into a ball, something my friends will never let me forget! Anyway the chap got sent off.</p>

		<p>We only won through 2 rounds to get here. However, everyone was up for it and it was played over at Fleet Town F.C. Martin brought over some music which we played in the dressing room before hand.</p><p>I played left midfield, with Stevie behind me at left back. The game was played in good spirit and we had lots of fans to cheer us on. Lau had unfortunately choose to meet her friends from Gravesend up in London. Dad came along however.</p><p>We scored first, but the game ended 1-1. In extra time we unfortunately lost another goal, and lost finally 2-1. I really enjoyed the game ever though we lost.</p>

    <info>
		<p>We had an important double header against bottom place York Road. We had to collect 4 points to finish above the two relegation spots. However, I had little motivation, compounded by their right back body checking me off the ball and spitting at me. I just couldn't be bothered. Anyway 4-1 and 3-1 we were, guaranteeing safety.</p>

		<p>A load of us went to the Greek Taverna restaurant in Frimley Road. Laura unfortunately was working a late. I sat between Phil "The Gannett" Rowe and Emma. Funnily enough I got on well with them, although Phil was being a pig. It was cramped but a very lively atmosphere. The food was all dips and things to put in dips!</p><p>As the evening progressed the atmosphere turned into a party one where people just stopped eating and danced. Too loud to chat. It was a great laugh. However, we weren't given anymore food. Come the end of the evening some argued with the management over the £5 a head bill! We got a fiver knocked off in the end, but we had a good night.</p>

Mike Collis got a little trophy and a Trevor Brooking signed picture as a memento for the past 25 years of service.</p><p>In the afternoon me, Lau, Nick and Martin went down the Tracco club to watch a boring cup final. Chelsea 1 V 0 Aston Villa.</p><p>In the evening we went to the Cricketers, Tongham for the presentation evening. Darren was player of the year. I won the pool competition and the scratch card. James Ball made an appearance which is quite rare. He'd admitted that he had spent a lot of time with Emma and neglected everyone. Another good night. Laura enjoyed herself.</p>

    <title>Normandy Holiday,  Portsmouth - St. Malo</title>
    <info>
		<p>We left in a bit of a mood, on Thursday, late afternoon. It was me, Laura, Nick and Martin, all in Mart's car and we headed for Portsmouth. We waited around for ages until we got on the boat and set sail for Saint Malo. We started and ended in the bar, playing cards and having a general laugh. We ended up going to bed, well lying across a couple of chairs at about 2 or 3 in the morning.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_06_XX-FirstNormandyHol.jpg</src><caption>Normandy Holiday</caption></image>

    <info>
		<image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_06_XX-NormandyHoliday01.jpg</src><caption>Laura In The Kitchen</caption></image><p>We were awoken by the passengers milling around the cafeteria waiting for it to be open at 6am! It wasn't a very comfortable sleep. We didn't fancy breakfast, and it wasn't long until we departed the boat and set off eastwards towards St Bruic. It was mainly motorway and uninteresting. The journey took a couple of hours. Chance for some to catch up on some sleep.</p><p>We decided to head straight for the chateaux. The closest town Quintin must have been 3 or 4 miles away. The directions that Martin's boss gave, included "turn right at the brown bins". It was in the middle of nowhere. Very nice nowhere, but nowhere! As we turned into a new road, it became narrower and a bit more bumpy. We eventually arrived exhausted.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_06_XX-NormandyHoliday03.jpg</src><caption>Laura and I</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_06_XX-NormandyHoliday04.jpg</src><caption>Quintin</caption></image><p>The house was big, old and in the process of being renovated. It was spacious, had plenty of land. We unpacked, chilled , then went off to the supermarket to get some food for the evening's BBQ and to look around Quintin. Quintin (pronounced can-tan) was old and hardly a sole to be seen. The shops were locked shut. except for a few . We couldn't quite work it out. We went to the out of town supermarket which was also practically empty, and bought loads of food and drink. The wine was as cheap as 80p a bottle! We returned home and had an axe throwing competition, but neither of us could get it stuck into the tree. However, we did score the tree which we felt guilty about.</p><p>The BBQ was good and went into the evening. We played monopoly and I got competitive which I don’t think Nick appreciated.</p><woops rating="4" woopstitle="Big Fire in French Farmhouse"><p>We decided to get the fire going, but had little kindling. However, next door did! We sneaked off and stole a batch of wood which we put straight onto the fire.</p><p>Blimey didn't it get hold it. Flames were going right up the chimney. It was roaring and cracking away. Sparks were actually coming out of the top of the chimney as we stood outside and marvelled. Inside the house the flames were lapping over the fireplace. We got some water to calm it down a bit. It was huge.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_06_XX-NormandyHoliday05.jpg</src><caption>Fire!</caption></image></woops>

    <title>Normandy Holiday, Local Village Tour</title>
    <info>
		<p>After a beautifully made breakfast, we decided to explore some of the villages and towns around the area, and to see if there was any nice countryside.</p><p>All the towns seemed the same as Quintin. Very picturesque, and old, but as dead as a doornail. We went to Ploeuc and Loudaec where we stopped off for a beer in the pub. We again went to the supermarket for some more food and drink. Nick taking advice for wines off a drunk Englishman!!</p><p>We returned back to chat and had a little rest before it was BBQ time again! I didn't eat a great deal but we certainly made a hot BBQ. Everyone had really hot chillies except me. All of a sudden Martin came over all ill and went to bed where he stayed for the rest of the evening. This must have been about 7pm. Me, Lau and Nick then played Trivial Pursuit. Nick and Lau cheated, but I had the last laugh and won and my cheating undetected!</p><p>I decided to go for a walk in the pitch black outdoors. I'd never seen the sky with so many stars. I walked and walked for miles down country roads. At times I heard the big cows in the fields breathing heavily and got quite worried. I'm sure I heard some galloping at one point. I was guessing my way around a loop. However, after about an hour I thought I must be going wrong and I couldn't make anything out ahead of me, total darkness, so I decided to retrace my steps and return home.</p>

    <title>Normandy Holiday, Coast</title>
    <info>
		<p>Again a gorgeous breakfast. Today we were heading for the north coastline. We went to Binic via Perin and Pordic. There was a massive beach, could hardly see the sea. There was a parade with many market stalls. At last we found somewhere with a bit of life. We wandered about, played Frisbee and football on the beach. I really need to learn how to throw a Frisbee. We finished by me kicking the ball over a 15 foot wall into a canal type lock! That was the end of that.</p><p>As we had a bit of money left we decided to go out and eat in Quintin. We got there mid-evening and tried to find a restaurant we saw on the Friday. However, we got a bit lost and wandered all around the empty town centre. It was quite eerie that there wasn't a soul to be seen, a noise or even a light on in a house! We had a laugh about it anyway. We eventually found a pizzeria. Very French cuisine! In the end there wasn't much else open. We were all a bit farty when it came to going into the restaurant and speaking French. So I had a go. "Bonjour" I greeted the waitress, to which she replied "Bon Soir". Woops mistake.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_06_XX-NormandyHoliday02.jpg</src><caption>Normandy Holiday</caption></image><p>We returned home after the meal only to find there was a message from Tony, the owner of the place. Laura and Martin went out to find a phone, whilst Nick and I began the cleanup operation and putting the furniture back under plastic sheeting to stop the mice from eating it. Laura and Martin went for ages. They couldn't get hold of a phone so late. Public phone boxes required a card, the police were no good. Of course we worried a bit.</p>

We saw Mission To Mars and Toy Story 2. As soon as we reached the Solent it began to rain! It hadn't rained for the whole time we were in France. We finally made it home and collapsed into bed.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_06_XX-NormandyHoliday07.jpg</src><caption>Goggled Eyed On Boat Journey Home</caption></image>

    <title>A Week's COM Course</title>
    <info>
		<p>I had been feeling funny most of the week - light headedness. Anyway at the last minute I was asked if I wanted to go up with Steve White to the Guerrilla COM course. Although it looked a tough schedule 9am-9pm each day, and the subject matter a bit advanced, I went for it. It was going to cost the company 2600 quid! 10% of my wage.</p><p>We left Sunday afternoon and got to Manchester in 2.75 hours! Not bad eh! We stayed at the 4 star Marriot hotel and the room cost £155 a night! I thought it was pretty standard room myself. The next 5 days were tough. We had a routine going, where we would get up at 7:15, swim and sauna till 8:30 then get a lovely breakfast, I had fruit, before starting at 9am. We broke for lunch for an hour, by which time, I needed to sleep, then went through the afternoon till 5:30pm. We again had a swim and some dinner, before doing a final 7 - 9:30pm. We then either collapsed or went to the bar for a few drinks.</p><p>The course itself raced on at a pace, although it was kept interesting. The first day packed a lot of introductory stuff which is where a lot of the useful stuff laid. Could have done with padding that out. A lot of subsequent stuff that MTS and COM+ specific. Although I understood some of it, I couldn't help think I was being taught how to run before I'd even tried walking. However, the week did give me some insight and a good base to jump into COM. I was raring to go and try some stuff out myself.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Euro 2000 was on, and we had the disappointment of losing to Portugal last Monday. However, it was as good as time as any to boot the Germans out as they had an old, weak team, without their star centre forward Bierhoff. Martin's parents were away, so invited us, Nick, Steve, Barrie, Laura, Duncan and James around. We put the TV outside and got the beers ready. It was a gripping, tense match, and we had a bit of a laugh to. We ended up 1-0 winners with Shearer being the goalscorer. An enjoyable evening.</p>

    <title>Suits, Leukaemia BBQ. Woman In Black</title>
    <info>
		<p>Barrie and I had to get to Cheeks in Bexley by 11am! Laura's dad voiced a preference on this shop, so I felt pressured to use it. Laura came along as well to keep us company. It wasn't too difficult to choose a suit. Barrie and I will be wearing a full frock coat, black and the ushers a normal looking suit. We have grey trousers with black pin stripes, a burgundy and gold waistcoat and a burgundy cravat. It took about 0.75 hour to get measured up. I'm a bit worried that everyone else might not like what I have chosen. We then trotted off back to Laura's where Barrie met Lau's parents for the first time. He seemed to get on well with them. We then took him to the church so he could see what it looked like and how big it was before we went back home.</p><p>At 4pm we went over to Steven's house for a charity BBQ in aid of Leukaemia. It was nice to see Lau's family again and Steven. We had to leave at 6pm though so we could go up to London and watch the Woman In Black. It was a thriller, which only had two actors. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Much better than a musical. I was disappointed that we couldn't stay on for a drink afterwards. Lau wanted to get back as she was scared!</p>

She was allowed to pick a present. We then went on to have a picnic which I'd prepared. I tried to make it really special. Pasta and potato salad, melons, salad, bacon and strawberries. I also got a chocolate birthday cake that mum made. It was really nice. Afterwards, we eventually found the village fete where we watched some kids football.</p><p>Presents:</p><ul><li>2 Woman In Black Tickets</li><li>Watch</li><li>Clothes from shopping bit</li><li>Video</li></ul><p>We made it back in time for the evening church service and then flaked out after an exhausting weekend.</p>

    <title>My Stag Weekend - Laura Lincolnshire</title>
    <info>
		<p>There were about a dozen of us who ventured from the Frimley ghetto, to go Hovercraft racing over in the Maidenhead direction. I found that they were dammed difficult to control. I thought, keep my weight at the front in order for it to go faster. However, this made the steering double difficult, and I came a cropper. On more than one occasion I left the track. I think Andrew managed to get banned from a second go, for going into the back of Michael. Carnage!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_08_19-StagNight02.jpg</src><caption>My Stag Weekend</caption></image><p>We then went over to Bristol for the evening's proceedings. The boys had arranged the most ropey stripper you'd ever like to see. Yep cheers boys. We ended up in a night club, where we seemed to lose a few people. I managed to fulfil some of my tasks and got back to the hotel unscathed.</p><woops rating="9" woopstitle="Motorway Accident!!"><p>Laura and family were on the other hand away for a week's holiday up in a prison in Lincolnshire, taking the mentally handicapped out for a break. However, disaster struck when a caravan decided to pull out into their lane on the motorway causing the car to swerve to take evasive action. It swerved one way, then too much the other and ended going up a bank and spinning to a rest on the hard shoulder.</p><p>Thank goodness everyone was OK, even though Laura wasn't wearing a seat belt as she was tending to one of the clients at the time. This meant they spent the rest of the holiday with just the Crabs Nissan Micra. So everything was 2 trips all of the time. What a nightmare.</p></woops>

    <title>Laura's Hen - Car Pickup</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura and friends went to a Greek Taverna in Dartford. She apparently was the star of the show and managed to make everyone envious of her... downing drinks, kissing bald men and dancing on tables. Laura's mum didn't fair to much better after her drinks were spiked. Anyway I think it all ended fairly early with Laura coming home feeling a tad bit ill at about 9 or 10 o'clock.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_08_26-HenNight01.jpg</src><caption>Laura's Hen Night</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_08_26-HenNight09.jpg</src><caption>Laura's Hen Night</caption></image><p>Michael and I on the other hand had to go and pick up Laura's car from somewhere close to the M11. Although Laura's car had little in the way of windows and just been involved in a car accident, I still managed to get over 100mph out of her!!</p>

    <title>!! Our Wedding !!</title>
    <info>
		<p>Woke at Karen and Richard's house along with the boys (Steve, Barrie, Nick and Martin). Waited for Renaud at Gravesend station he was late!! Typical Belgian. We then made our way over to the hotel, Black Prince, to get changed and ready. The fire alarms went off which made it quite interesting. Those upsets and the heavy Bluewater traffic made us very late. I think we arrived 20 minutes before the ceremony started.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-02-CharlotteEllieLauraSusanHelen.jpg</src><caption>Bridesmaids with Laura</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-06-MartinBarrie.jpg</src><caption>Barrie the best man with me</caption></image><p>Laura on the other hand got ready at her parents’ house. They went to get their hair done and the photographer took a load of photo's</p><p>The ceremony went very well. It was held at St Nicholas Church, Southfleet. Laura looked très belle in her dress. So did the bridesmaids, Susan, Ellie, Charlotte and Helen. Clifford, the vicar, made us feel relaxed throughout the ceremony. A blast of Abba's 'I do, I do, I do' was heard whilst we were signing the registers! The customary confetti and birdseed!! were thrown at us afterwards as well as a few more photo's. We travelled in style in an old, old car to the reception at the Black Prince</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-07-MartinLauraSigningRegister.jpg</src><caption>Signing the register</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-08-MartinLauraClifford.jpg</src><caption>Us with Clifford (the vicar)</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-11-Lineup-JetteMartinLauraChris.jpg</src><caption>My Parents</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-12-Lineup-MartinLauraGerryCarol.jpg</src><caption>Laura's Parents</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-15-Lineup-BridesmaidsUshers.jpg</src><caption>Bridesmaids and Ushers</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-16-WalkingBackDownTheAisle02.jpg</src><caption>Down the aisle</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-17-Gerry-Jette-MormorSalute.jpg</src><caption>Mormor salute and Gerry</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-21-Lineup-MartinFamily.jpg</src><caption>My Family</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-22-Lineup-LauraFamily.jpg</src><caption>Laura's Family</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-27-Lineup-MartinFriends.jpg</src><caption>My Friends</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-26-Lineup-LauraFriends.jpg</src><caption>Laura Friends</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-27-Lineup-FamilyFriends.jpg</src><caption>Family Friends</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-30-Confetti4.jpg</src><caption>Confetti</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-30-Confetti5.jpg</src><caption>Confetti</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-31-GazingintoMartin.jpg</src><caption>Laura loving me!!</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-32-Car-MartinLauraInCar.jpg</src><caption>In Car</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_09_02-34-Grandparents.jpg</src><caption>Grandparents</caption></image><p>I couldn't eat any of the wedding breakfast due to the nerves.

Could we get rid of them!! Only joking. we were both knackered and my cheeks were aching where I had been smiling so much through the day. In terms of a party it was the best, and will never be surpassed. We really enjoyed it so much.</p>

    <title>Carbon Monoxide Poisoning</title>
    <info>
		<woops rating="10" woopstitle="A Bit Of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning"><p>Helen and Nigel came over to stay for the weekend. The previous night we went down the pub and had a few drinks. We gave Helen and Nigel our bed and we slept in the spare room with the door open.</p><p>I remember waking in the morning to Laura groaning away and looking really unwell. Helen and Nigel thought we were up to no good! At this stage I believed I had a clear head. I decided to go and get Laura a sick bowl and a glass of water. As soon as I stood up, I collapsed onto the bed side table and was knocked unconscious for a short period of time. The big crash prompted Helen and Nigel to come in. Nigel had opened the windows suspecting a carbon monoxide leak. The ambulance was called.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_10_XX-02-CarbonMonoxide.jpg</src><caption>Silent Killer</caption></image><p>When I came round, I couldn't speak properly and was concerned for Laura. The ambulance men I think suspected drugs, and I remember both Helen and Nigel kept saying they haven't taken drugs. At this stage we only suspected carbon monoxide poisoning. It wasn't until we got down the hospital that they confirmed our blood oxygen levels were dangerously low.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2000/2000_10_XX-01-BoilerOfDeath.jpg</src><caption>Boiler Of Death</caption></image><p>We ended up being taken by Ambulance to Haslar, Gosport hospital and put in the hyperbaric chamber. This is used to get the required oxygen levels back into the blood, commonly used to treat people with the 'bends'. Laura's family came down to see us in the chamber, where we had to put these space type helmets on. Anyway we stayed overnight in the hospital together for observation, which we both hated. Laura's grandparents came down a day later to pick us up and take us home. We felt fine.</p></woops>

    <title>5cm diameter by a foot long hole</title>
    <info>
		<woops rating="6" woopstitle="Tender care for old house"><p>Drilled a hole a couple of inches in diameter through our 160 year old house. Even had to buy special bits for the drill to do it. The wall was so thick I drilled from inside of the house outwards halfway, then from outside the house inwards. Of course the two holes did not match! In the end I got a scaffold pole and a big mallet and smashed my way through. When we came to selling the house I managed to get the bit of plaster that had flaked off and selotape over my handy work. This was all so I could run a thick electric cable up to the shed, which I had incidently extended!</p><p>Ended up knackering the drill in the process. Smoke was coming from the motor.</p></woops>

    <title>1st Wedding Anniversary - Dublin</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went to Dublin for a few days. We flew across and got a bus to the hotel. It was a busy weekend as U2 were playing locally, which I would have love to have seen. Anyway we arrived at the hotel and they didn't know anything about our booking... which we had paid for already on the internet. We eventually could not get this resolved so we had to settle for paying again for 1 night, and finding another hotel for the next night. Unperturbed we ventured into Dublin determined to put that all behind us. We wondered around the trendy, Temple Bar region. The next day we took a bus tour around Dublin, and to be honest we weren't that impressed by it. Not a lot for us to get excited about.</p><p>We went to the Guinness factory also. A nice weekend for the two of us.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2001/2001_09_02-08-Dublin1stAnniversaryTrip.jpg</src><caption>Me outside Guinness brewery</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2001/2001_09_02-18-Dublin1stAnniversaryTrip.jpg</src><caption>Lau sampling the stuff</caption></image>

    <title>Hang Gliding</title>
    <info>
		<p>I've really wanted to try out hang gliding out for a while. And now my chance. A group of us novice's went to start. We were first shown how to rig a hang glider, then we went to the top of the hill (equivalent to Frimley Green rec) and begun running down it, and got some flight. We were landing on our bellies, which is how we are supposed to start. We were on trainer gliders so we only went 10 metres in the air and lasted about 50/100 metres before landing. Had 4 or 5 attempts throughout the day. Very frustrating coz all I want to do is fly! Oh well walk before running and all that.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2001/HangGliding-FirstAttempt4.jpg</src><caption>Me flying</caption></image>

I remember feeling dizzy and weak before we even climbed the mountain.</p><p>We were just in trainers and jumpers. Everyone else was in serious hiking gear with rain coasts on. The normal people and the plums!!! Anyway we got half way along, and we had some great views.</p><p>However, we hadn't done anything other walk up a path. i.e. No mountain climbing yet. This is easy. Half an hour later, and we reached the steep ascent. By the time we reached the top, we were literally in with the clouds. It was damp and slightly cold. However, we sweated loads getting up.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2002/2002_02_23-04-CapelGormanWales.jpg</src><caption>Looking over Llyn Teyrn</caption></image><p>We then realized there was a train to the top! However, it was shut.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2002/2002_02_23-05-CapelGormanWales.jpg</src><caption>Us at the summit</caption></image><p>We reached the top after 2 or 3 hours.

    <title>Astra finally replaced by the PUG</title>
    <info>
		<p>After a number of incidents with Poppy (as Laura affectionately calls her) I needed a new car. Here are the reasons</p><woops woopstitle="Spill Yellow Paint Over The Car" rating="7"><p>I managed to spill yellow paint in the back seat, when I borrowed a whole pot of paint without realizing the lid wasn't securely on. I went around a roundabout and hadn't realize it had tipped onto its side. There was so much 'double yellow line' paint over the back seat and floor. I remember when I opened the door, it started flowing out onto the road. I didn't even attempt to clean it up, because I knew it was going to be no good. It eventually dried to a very thick crust. It was legendary.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2002/2002_01_19-02-PoppyDaisy.jpg</src><caption>Back seat - nice shade of yellow</caption></image></woops><woops woopstitle="Car got 'stingered'. Cost more to get back than its worth" rating="8"><p>Someone decided to steal my car! It wasn't difficult to pick the lock, as all you needed to do is put any key in the driver’s side door and hey presto! This was a useful feature for me, allowing me to seemingly lock myself out of the car. The thief managed to break this 'feature' when he broke in, as ever since then the lock worked as it was intentionally designed. A crying shame.</p><p>Anyway Poppy was taken by a drunk, without a license, from the Old Dean estate. Luckily a neighbour had seen it been taken, after the thief decided to bump into the cars trying to get out of the parking space. The Police finally stopped the car, by setting a 'stinger' trap by the Ferrari garage in Egham. However, the Police impounded the car at a garage so they could get forensic evidence. I wonder what they thought of the paint. So it cost me a heap of money in storage costs and 4 new tyres. I never got compensated for this. It cost me more to put the car back on the road, than the car was actually worth.</p></woops><woops woopstitle="Car roll down the hill into another car whilst I was asleep" rating="8"><p>The handbrake was wearing a bit thin.... and I park the car on a hill.... which at the bottom of is the very busy and fast A30. I think you can almost guess what's coming next. Anyway one day I go to my car in the morning to go to work, when this neighbour (by coincidence the one who rang the police when my car got stolen) came out to confront me. My car had rolled down the hill into this neighbours car. Luckily there was no damage, and luckily it was there in order to stop it from going onto the A30. The thing was that this women couldn't go to work, because if she moved her car, mine would roll down the hill.</p></woops><p>When I took the car to the scrappy I managed to get 60mph in 2nd gear, which I thought was quite an achievement. Black smoke was billowing out of the exhaust.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2002/2002_02_15-11-PoppyCrushed.jpg</src><caption>Poppy Crushed!</caption></image>

    <title>Golf, Grandpop’s, Karen and Richards</title>
    <info>
		<p>After finally deciding that Michael and I were not to be included in the photo for Laura's mum's 50th birthday present, we went off to play some golf at Swanley. I won (of course). The best pitch and putt I've played on. The grass was in such good condition. All of us then went to see Grandpop near Swanley. He has deteriated quite a bit since I last saw him. Not in terms of health, but he is forgetting what he says 5 minutes ago. The number of time we were asked about what we're up to. He's so sweet really and it's distressing to him like it... especially when he forgets about Ethel's death. Very awkward. He's ringing up Gerald all the time, to the extent where he has to ignore his calls sometimes. It's so sad. we later went to Karen and Richards for a meal. The time flew by. It was nice to get on with them.</p>

    <title>Soccer 6</title>
    <info>
		<p>After watching some of the England v Cameroon game, we drove up to London for the Soccer 6's. Most impressed as we made it from door to door in about 1 hour. Found parking very close by. Have to remember this for next year. Anyway it was good if a little long. Saw plenty of celebs. Hardly any I knew. Michael knew all the Page 3 models. I knew the ex-pro's and Laura and Ellie knew most of the others.</p>

    <title>Barney Stock - Day 1</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was Jubilee weekend. It was also Barney Stock weekend. Steve had organised a massive party at his parents. A weekend party.</p><p>Gaz and Mart were DJ's on the decks, there was pugile sticks for that Gladiator game. I had a bit too much Chardolini. I remember performing a summersault off the bouncy castle thing and everyone watching and biting my tongue. The whole place seemed to go quiet.</p><p>Anyway Gaz was trying it on with Charlotte!!! Nick was enjoying himself, Bazza plastered, and Michael in the car asleep! A great party.</p><p>There were masses of bodies on the floors sleeping.</p>

    <title>Oasis Concert</title>
    <info>
		<p>I went with David Humphreys to Finsbury Park to see the Oasis gig. There was an edge to the whole atmosphere. We went into a pub before hand, where you had to watch your back.</p><p>I remember there was a group of lads just sitting on the pavement having their beer, and this meathead just came up and stamped in a huge puddle and soaked them all. It could have kicked off big time but didn't.</p><p>Black Rebel Motorcycle Club were the support act and as we entered the park it began to rain, and rain hard. People ended up having sliding competitions in the mud. Fantastic. There was a now a real carnival atmosphere, with people playing football and not caring a less about getting wet.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2002/2002_07_06-02-OasisFinsburyPark.jpg</src><caption>Oasis - Finsbury Park</caption></image><p>The convert started and I went to get drinks, but couldn't find David again. That was the last I saw of him. I must have searched for about 30 minutes on where I thought we stood. It didn't help that it was raining. I gave up looking and tried to make my way to the front. It was a good concert, but they are well passed their best.</p><p>I had the nightmare of getting back home, which I managed. David on the other hand caught a taxi back and lost his house keys. He was in a bit of a state.</p>

		<p>
        We hired a car and dared go on the American roads. First we decide to go to<googlelink link="Boggy+Creek">Boggy Creek</googlelink>and took an airboat ride around the swamps. We saw an aligators snout in the water and a big bird in the trees. I was so close to taking a parascending ride, but bought a Boggy Creek cap instead!
      </p><p>We continued to the east coast and eventually got to Cocoa Beach. It was really hot. We sunbathed and played in the water. A storm was brewing and before we could vacate the beach, the heavens opened in a big way. We took refuge in a huge surf shop which pleased me.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2002/2002_08_02-01-Florida-BoggyCreekCocoaBeach.jpg</src><caption>Boggy Creek</caption></image>

		<p>I plucked up the courage to have a go on the near vertical slide. You stand in a pod, really, really high up. The floor then disapears from under you and then you proceed to hurtle down, barely touching the slide at a great rate of knots! Gets the old heart racing.</p><p>Also at Wet n'Wild there was a surfing lake. There was an over head rail with ropes dangling down. You had to hold on to the rope and balance your way around a rather large pond. Great fun.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2002/2002_08_06-13-Florida-WetNWild.jpg</src><caption>Wet n'Wild</caption></image>

    <title>Sarah and Paul's Wedding</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went up to Essex for Sarah and Paul's wedding. It was quite sweet the way Paul sang to Sarah during the service.</p><p>Paul's Dad had too much to drink and made comments during the speeches. By the end of the night he got decked by Paul's brother. Shame we didn't see that, because apparently an ambulance turned up to take him away.</p><p>The reception was held in a wicked stately home. After the meal there was a casino competition, which Michael got into the final with. First prize was a holiday. He didn't win.</p>

    <title>Plane Flight</title>
    <info>
		<p>For Dads birthday Susan and I got him an hour's plane flight from Blackbushe to Portsmouth and back. I enjoyed the first 30 minutes, then felt a bit sick after that. We could recognise loads. We followed the A3 for a lot of the way. It was amazing to see how many people have swimming pools in their gardens.</p>

		<p>A few of us (William, Karen, Richard, Helen) went down to Brighton for the day. We mooched around the town, beach and pier.</p><p>In the evening we went to Jess and John party which was held in the Conservative Club. It was quite a strange party. This very grand building, hidden away in a dead road. We had to buzz to get in! There was a disco in the back room. We didn't know anyone else there, except for one of Laura's old school friend (Jess's best friend). I enjoyed it as like something a little bit different.</p>

    <info>
		<p>It was just Dad and I who were the removal men. Although, I had been preparing for us to move for the past few weeks, there was lots of work still to do.</p><p>We managed to hire a transit at a reasonable cost (something like £80), I think it took 2 trips. It was a well organised and slick operation. Dad and I put a lot of hard work into it all.</p><p>Our new house, was NEW. Off white walls and carpets, nice new fitted kitchen, Just a few snags, but otherwise we were ready to move our stuff straight away without having to worry about decorating too much.</p><p>Mum and Susan came over later on and we all had Fish and Chips for dinner.</p>

    <title>Card Night - Johnny B's</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had a card night over at Johnny Bakers house.</p><p>A memorable comment from Stevey Barnett was, "So, are you still a student", inferring the house was in such bad condition that John lived in a student house.</p><p>It wasn't too memorable for me as I was completely ratted by about 9 o'clock. Past that time I cannot remember anything. I went out early within the first 45 minutes, and proceeded to drink 2 bottles of Amarula, pretty quickly. No joke.</p><woops rating="7" woopstitle="Two Bottles of Amarula = Samurai Sworded"><p>Apparently I was very close to getting my head panned in, by a mad Samurai sword owning Irish man called Fonzy.</p><p>Well the boys told me to call him that, but he hates it. He's actually called Alfonso. Anyway at one point he climbed over the sofa's to go and get a drink and pushed him onto the sofa, and laughed at him, as drunks do! The room fell silent, there was tension in the air, and he must have contemplated in giving me a smacking. Anyway he didn't, but a close thing.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2003/2003_03_22-01-CardNight.jpg</src><caption>Two bottles surely not me!</caption></image><p>I was havoc. John was just following me around making sure I didn't cause too much damage/chaos. I collapsed by the front door. I finally slept on the first floor landing. One of Johns female housemates, rang from her room to John, to say I was sounding a bit ill. I think she was scared to pass me on the landing. I managed to hurl up, a number of times in Johns bathroom. I sprayed their bathroom. I tried very hard to clear it up. The floor the sink, the toilet. The carpet bit around the toilet was ruined where I didn't really aim right. I gave John a fiver in the morning to get a replacement.</p><p>Nick drove my car home the morning afterwards, as I was still drunk!!</p><p>
          See a <a href="images/years/2003/2003_03_22.MartinCardNight.wmv">video</a> here of the night's proceedings.

    <title>Great Uncle Bob and Claire P</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went to Great Uncle Bob's funeral. He was a very kind and loving man. The proceeding went with the respect he deserved.   We went for a bite to eat afterwards and saw all of the Weston side of the family, which was very nice</p><p>On our way home we had arranged to meet up with Claire and Georgia at their lovely little cottage. It was lovely to see how much bigger Georgia   had got. We had a couple of cups of tea and a nice chat before heading back off home again.</p>

    <title>Trip to Royal Maritime Museum and Sanders Christmas Meal</title>
    <info>
		<ul><li><i>afternoon</i>We drove to Greenwich, walked through the park. It was such a miserable, rainy, windy day. Our umbrella 'blew out'. We went to see the Cutty Sark, then had lunch in a traditional pie and mash shop. It was packed with lots of people coming in from the cold.    We then walked to the Maritime Museum. It wasn't very busy, but it was very modern. We only saw a bit,   because I was getting grumpy and Daddy was a bit tired.
        </li><li><i>evening</i>After visiting Grandma and Grandpop, we went to the Sanders for a Christmas meal. It was lovely. We got a lovely Christmas   Ball to hang on the tree.

    <title>Christmas Eve</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy worked in the morning. We went over to Farmor and Farfar's in the late afternoon for our traditional Danish Christmas, where we are allowed to open some presents!! Yippee. We had Roast Pork, we played games, then we were allowed to open some of our presents. I think I was more interested in the wrapping paper than the presents themselves. I love to scrunch the paper and put it in my mouth. We ended up going home at about 11 o'clock.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Christmas Day was spent opening presents with mummy and daddy in their bed. We later went to Farmor and Farfar's house to have breakfast. Oldemor was there to. Then mummy and I went to St. Andrews church for the Christmas service. It was so boring I slept. We then rushed over to Grandpop's and Grandma's where there was a Christmas lunch, and opened more presents. We had a walk around Istead Rise, played some games, watched some TV.</p>

    <title>Trip to Bexhill</title>
    <info>
		<p>We travelled from Grandma's house down to Bexhill. It seemed to take forever to get there. It was so cold and windy and the waves on the sea were really big and came crashing onto the Beach. It was soooo fresh. We had some lunch in a small cafe, which seemed to be the only thing open in town. We had a lovely walk before returning back to Grandma's. We played games and watched TV in the evening</p>

    <title>Bromley Sales Shopping</title>
    <info>
		<ul><li><i>morning</i>We got up ridiculously early to go to Bromley for some sales shopping. Daddy, being a cheap skate found a hooky, residential car park.... but the car park barrier came down and he got our car locked in. The only way out was to go and ask one of the residents for a key, to raise the barrier. Daddy waited and waited for over an hour hoping a res dent would want to go out. In the end he knocked on someone 's door. Got them out of bed, to come and let us out!! What a plonker.
        </li><li><i>afternoon</i>We went over to see Michael's mum and sisters, before returning back home.

		<p>Mummy had her 4th day at working back as a school nurse. Daddy looked after me today. After clinic, in the afternoon we went to Farmor's school kitchen and had a look around. We then went to Frimley Lodge park to feed the ducks along the canal, and to play on the swings. It was great fun, although it was a bit cold.</p>

    <title>London - Childhood and Tate Modern museum</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had a nice day up in London visiting some museums. First we went to the Childhood museum in Bethnal Green. There were lots of toys there. Daddy beat mummy at connect 4.   We walked up and down the high street because mummy and daddy couldn't decide where to eat. They decided to get on to a double-decker bus, at the top, at the front. Me being nosey, loved   it up there! We got off at Mansion house, grabbed something to eat at Burger King, then walked on across the Millennium bridge.</p><p>We went into the Tate Modern. It was a huge building and in the foyer there was a massive half sun, that when projected on to the mirror made it look like a whole sun. It was wicked as    we could see ourselves in the mirrored ceiling. Well through the camcorder anyway. We trawled through the galleries mostly up on daddy's shoulders. I got lots of smiles and grins. Mummy was    like a small schoolchild in the nudes section. She giggled and couldn't appreciate the artistic value of the works of art. We   managed our way to the top of the building where there was a restaurant and we got some much need refreshments whilst admiring the view over St. Paul's and the Thames.</p><p>We walked across the Millennium bridge again and alongside Victoria embankment, past Temple, to Charing Cross station. After a bit of stationary train swapping, we were off   on our way back to Hither Green. We got in the car exhausted and drove to Grandma's and Grandpop's, where Auntie Ellie and Michael were. We had a meal and crashed out.</p>

    <title>Katie's Christening</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was my special day. Mummy and Daddy wanted to officially introduce me to the church.... well ok mainly mummy. It happened at St Nicholas church in Southfleet. The reason why we have chosen a church so far from where we, and most of the congregation live is because we, or more accurately mummy has been going to that church from when she    was a little child and it holds special memories as it is the place mummy and daddy were wed. Three people were specially chosen to be my godparents. We decided to pick from outside of the family, as we reckon family members have already got a special role in my life. Kindly mummy's friends Helen and Karen, who are regular church go'ers have agreed to be Godmothers.    We were scratching our heads quite hard to find one of daddy's friends who was religious and responsible!!! In fact, none of daddy's friends are that religious, so daddy's best mate    (and best man at the wedding) Barrie has stepped into the role of 'The Godfather'!!</p><ul><li><i>morning</i>We woke fairly early and played in bed as usual. Then it got all very rushed (as usual) and we made it to the church, with only 10 minutes to spare! The church was   full. There was the normal congregation and my christening was integrated with it. It was a really nice service. Half way through, mummy, daddy and my godparents had to all stand    at the front and renounce all evil, which they luckily did. Clifford, the vicar then took me on a tour all around the church to welcome me to all the regular church go'ers. I was a very brave girl and didn't cry once. We had a few more hymns and a sermon, which I got a few mentions in before we headed over to the Woodlands pub for a bite to eat.
        </li><li><i>afternoon</i>Everyone eventually got to the Woodlands where we had the hall upstairs to ourselves. We chilled and had a drink. It was nice for Mummy and Daddy to catch up with friends and family who they haven't seen for yonks. It was really nice atmosphere. Daddy gave a short speech (which he HATES doing) and toasted me! Way Hey. We   must have been there for 2.5 hours before everyone filtered out. Thank you to all those who came.
        </li><li><i>evening</i>&gt;We went back to Grandma's and Grandpop's where we began to open all the lovely presents. We didn't realize how generous people had been until we got home. I got some religious bits, crockery, toys and even some money. Far too much stuff to put down here. We travelled back after a cup of tea. Farfar and Farmor came   round later to help me open the rest of the presents and cards. Overall a very good day, and thank you for all my presents. To cap the day off, mummy went to work a night shift at the hospital!!

    <title>Over to Auntie Susan's and Graham's</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went to a very small country park in Little Sandhurst (Ambarrow Court). It took all of 2 minutes to walk round, but mummy assured us there would be petting animals, a Victorian manor house, a buggy track and a butterfly farm. We must of blinked at the wrong time!</p><p>Afterwards we went to see Auntie Susan and Graham at their house. We had another walk down to the duck pond. Very nice.</p><p>After this Daddy went to watch the last bit of Camberley vs. Chertsey, in a disappointing 0-0 draw.   Grandma and Grandpop then came over to ours for a couple of hours to see me, which is always nice.</p>

    <title>Yucky Weather</title>
    <info>
		<p>What a horrible days weather. Because Daddy hasn't been feeling very well, he had to pull    out of the Fleet Half Marathon that he had entered. He was sad at that, but little relieved as the weather was so windy, rainy and cold.    Anyway we went to see Row and Simon finish in 1hr 56mins, which was very nice.</p><p>We then all took Mrs Oddie to see her son. She had been broken into during the week. A man claiming to be from the gas board. Very sad.</p>

		<p>Again another yucky weather day. Farmor came round in the morning to see me and stayed for a cup of tea.</p><p>We decided to try to go to the Rainforest centre near Newbury. So we went off and went for a spot of swimming first,    which of course Katie loved. However, the weather was bad as usual, so decided just to get a spot of lunch and wander around the shops, before leaving back for home.</p><p>In the evening Ellie and Michael game over for a games evening. Unfortunately they beat mummy and daddy in game of Trivial Pursuit. Daddy had one too many   glasses of wine. hiccup, gulp, hiccup....sore head. Ellie and Michael stayed the night.</p>

    <info>
		<ul><li><i>morning</i>Daddy went off to the Ideal Home Exhibition, whilst me and mummy went over to Ellie and Michael's to help them pack.
        </li><li><i>evening</i>Karen and Richard kindly babysat me, so Mummy and Daddy could go out together. I think it's only their second time they've had a night out without me, certainly the first on their own without anyone else. They went to a pub in Compton.
        </li></ul><p>Been noticing a bit of a change in Katie. The things that used to make her laugh or comfort her don't anymore, instead she loves to bang her pots together, she likes me making faces at her, she's always waving. She becoming a right little madam. If she doesn't get her way, well she lets you know about it. She also has become more dependent on Laura. If she goes out of the room, then she'll quite often cry</p>

		<ul><li><i>morning</i>We went to Godstone Farm to have a look at the animals. I particularly loved the donkey and sheep. The weather shortened our stay, but I think I might become a farmer!
        </li><li><i>afternoon</i>We went over to Sevenoaks to go swimming. I splash more than ever, and always on the look out to play with others of a similar age. I still enjoy eating all the swimming toys even though they are all wet.
        </li><li><i>afternoon</i>We then went over to see my great grandparents and great, great grandparents grave! We all spoke to them to make sure they know we think about them a lot.
        </li><li><i>evening</i>We zoomed over to Alton to stay the night around the Elder's. We had a lovely lasagne and we beat Michael and Ellie at trivial pursuit this time. That's 1-1 now.

    <info>
		<p>Mummy had just done the first night of four in a row, so Daddy was going to look after me for the next few days. Our first day was spent lopping Farfar's tree down in his back garden. Daddy went higher than the house, without a harness. Some really big bits came down and amazing, we all didn't get injured and we kept all Farmor's plants intact. Auntie Susan looked after me while Daddy and Farfar where playing with the chain saws.</p>

		<ul><li><i>morning</i>The weather was a bit glum.... well it was raining. We had to get out of the house, so that mummy could sleep, so we headed towards Bournemouth. However, both me and Daddy were still tired and I was I hadn't woke at 6:15!! We stopped off at Basingstoke for a quick nap in the car. When we woke, 15 minutes later, it was still raining, so we went off to Homebase in Basingstoke and played around there. It brightened up. Hooray.
        </li><li><i>afternoon</i>So we ventured down to Bournemouth finally. It was busy, and they had a French market in the square with lots of nice looking food. We had a milkshake in our usual haunt, then made our way to the pier area. We sat by the promenade and daddy fed and watered me. It was really nice and relaxing. We then went into the arcades, but I didn't win any money! We hurried back home in time for mummy to wake up.
        </li><li><i>afternoon</i>We rushed off to Coral Reef and had a great time nosing around. Much better than other pools we've been to.

    <title>Fiona And Kelly's Wedding</title>
    <info>
		<p>We set off for Stansted for the 1pm wedding. Stansted looked lovely. Typical Kent village, sunny day, pub (which serves Hogs Back TEA), narrow lanes and a church on the hill. It was a lovely, small church holding just 90 in the congregation. Now the mission was to make sure Katie didn't squawk or cry too much throughout the wedding. She certainly was enjoying proceedings. So nosey!! The service was great. The vicar's sermon was more like a best mans speech! the vows were exchanged and Kelly and Fi were wed.</p><p>We sort of got lost on the way to the reception, but eventually found it. Helen, Nigel and Vicky were also invited for the whole day's proceedings. We had a lovely roast Lamb meal, and then onto the speeches. All of which were very good. Fiona's dad was proud of both of her daughters and the best man ribbed Kelly about his girly type name. It was getting passed Katie's bedtime so Laura took her back to her parents and returned later. She returned to the rest of the rabble who later turned up. It was nice to see the whole gang there. Jessica, John, William, Andrew, George, Karen and Richard. Probably the first time we have all been in the room together for a long, long time.</p><p>Our evening was curtailed at about midnight as we had a phone call saying that Katie was getting upset. We stayed at the Weston residence.</p>

    <first name="katie">Trip down the hospital</first>
    <info>
		<p>This week is a chill out week. No best man speech to prepare, no football training, just relaxing.... until Miss Pickle decides she wants to scare us to death. She now is beginning to explore so much, it's difficult to keep up. On Monday Miss Pickle decided to fall off the bed head first, she seemed to go unconscious for a second or two, and Daddy called an ambulance. However, the 999 people don't have our address on their database. By the time it got round to explaining where we are it seemed she was OK again.</p><p>Then we have had her crawling into the en-suite shower, picking up the whole plug hole unit (thanks Barrett's for securing it. great job done!!). There was hair and yuck all over it. She decided to put this in her mouth.</p><p>Then today she was playing with a small snow globe, and it smashed as Daddy was changing Miss Pickle after bath time!! Perspex in the mouth and this nail varnish smelling liquid over her lips and maybe in her mouth. We rushed down to Frimley Park. Miss Pickle was wondering what was going on, as she wasn't crying or feeling any effects..... as if nothing happened. anyway we got the all clear and luckily nothing has damaged her.....YET.</p><p>We also got a passport photo done of her. She looks great.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_04_28-PassportPhoto.jpg</src><caption>Passport mug shot</caption></image>

    <title>Old Boys Game - Alton visit</title>
    <info>
		<ul><li><i>morning</i>Today was the annual Old Boys game event. Daddy was looking forward to this, and it was a chance for me to see him play football for once. Daddy got off to great start by smacking the old boys centre forward within 5 seconds (by accident). Barrie had a bad back so he was on the sidelines with Mummy and I. He's a funny man. We left at half time because it was getting a bit cold. The game ended up at 1-1. Daddy was naughty and stayed for a few drinks after. We went to Camberley to meet up with Grandma and Granddad.
        </li><li><i>afternoon</i>In the afternoon Mummy and I chilled, whilst Daddy was putting a small path in the back garden. I think I am beginning the teething process as I have had a cold and not sleeping to well.
        </li><li><i>evening</i>We went over to Ellie and Michael's in the evening for a nice meal. I loved it there as there was a new front room and kitchen to explore. We had fun playing together all of us. Daddy and Uncle Michael went out pubbing for 4 hours!!! We stayed the night over.

        </li><li><i>evening</i>We all ventured over to the Nightingale in Ash for the Casuals Presentation night. Farmor and Farfar babysat for me. Mummy reversed into a post and then blamed Daddy for some reason. No damage was done. But Nick and Martin, our passengers laughed. Michael had lost his voice which was funny. Daddy came home with a few trophies and medals. He won 'Manager Player Of The Year' and got something for coming second in 'Players, Player Of The Year', and a medal for being a part of the most successful Casuals team ever, only by the fact we didn't get relegated, not because we won anything!! Anyway it was nice to see everyone enjoy themselves. Good fun.

    <title>Windsurfing</title>
    <info>
		<p>We got up early to get down to Hayling Island for a 9am start. Daddy and Uncle Michael setup the windsurf and got changed into their wet suits. They looked very funny. They were the only ones out in the water. Reason being, because it was early, it was wet and cold. Anyway Daddy had a short go and done OK. Michael done very well and towed Daddy around the sea quite quickly. Anyway Daddy got a bit cold and tired shortly afterwards and gave up. Mummy, Ellie and I had a couple of walks along the front while the boys were playing out in the sea. The weather got worse and worse, eventually the rain was coming in hard, fast and horizontal!! We gave up, and had fish and chips in the car and made our way home.</p><p>In the afternoon Daddy continued to put some extra beds in the garden whilst Mummy and I played. I am still not feeling too great. I wish my teeth would come through.</p>

    <info>
		<p>We walked up Leith Hill, but it was really muddy, so mummy and daddy carried me up. The weather was rainy, so we couldn't actually see the views unfortunately. After stopping in Dorking for a bit, we moved onto the Star pub for Charlotte's 18th birthday celebration. Ellie and Michael stayed over.</p>

		<p>Daddy and Michael went to play a friendly game of football. It went to penalties and Daddy missed and lost Casuals the game!! They rushed over to Alton, where Mummy, I and Ellie were, and we had a mini birthday lunch for Michael, then went to the French market, where Daddy bought a smelly, dried sausage. We then had to rush back and take Mrs Oddie out.</p>

    <title>The Fars, School Fete, Barn Dance</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy worked a night, so I was solely under the influence of Daddy for most of the day. We first went to meet up with Farmor and go shopping with her, then back to the Fars for a bit of playtime, before going off to feed the ducks at Tomlins Pond. There was a really aggressive swan chasing the geese around. It was funny to see, as she never caught them. We then moved onto Lakeside School fete, where we got some cakies. Mmmm. After lunch we ventured back to wake mummy up and we all went to the swings. I love going on the swings. It makes me double smile.</p><p>We went over to Rake, near Liss for a Barn Dance in aid of Karen's sister, Rebecca's home. We met up with Mummy's parents and sister. It was a lovely sunny day and it was a nice relaxing atmosphere, although the music wasn't exactly the Foo Fighters!! It was a big house, accommodating about 20 or so adults with the same condition. It looked very nice and I especially liked all the things in the garden to play with. We got home had a sleep before Mummy had to go to work again</p>

    <title>Barrie And Laura's Wedding</title>
    <info>
		<p>What a great day! Daddy woke up at Barrie house with the rest of the boys (Barrie, Martin, Nick and Michael) in the front room at about 5am.... everyone was on a bit of a high and excited for the day ahead. Daddy apparently looked a bit nervous, and instead of the Best Man looking after the groom, it was more like the other way round! The dam cat (Jinx Man) made sure they weren't going to sleep well. They managed to make their way over to Safeway's for breakfast, except Daddy, who couldn't eat. They then proceeded to go over to the hotel. Uncle Michael went back home to see Mummy and I. The hotel was ideal. Small enough to have exclusive ownership for the day, big enough to hold 60/80/100 guests. It was an old manor house from the 17th century. The gardens surrounding it, were in perfect order. We took a look around, saw the marquee around the back where the disco, meal and speeches were to take place. Barrie noticed he was still wearing his paint ridden work watch, and he had forgotten the money for the orchestra. So daddy made a trip home with him to get all the stuff together. We started to get ready at 11-ish. Daddy didn't know how to do his cravat or put cufflinks on! What a woos. Anyway they all posed for photo's before moving on to Odiham.</p><p>Meanwhile Mummy and I were at Auntie Ellie's getting ready. Back in Odiham the boys were in The Bell, for a swifty. Barrie had a pint of shandy (what a girl)! Anyway time was marching on and about half an hour before the wedding we decided to make our way up the hill to the church. The orchestra had already started to play... and Bazza was at last looking a little nervous. He spent most of the time in the front pew. It was nice for Daddy to see his old lollypop lady and friends and family. Farmor and Far were even there. Mummy and I eventually arrived and sat near the back.</p><p>The ceremony started just a little after 1:30pm, and Laura looked 'très bien'. Barrie didn't know whether he was allowed to look as she came down the aisle. Barrie and Laura exchanged smiles and the vicar commenced with the service. The Dunc-meister was chief camera man. Boy has he got a cheeky grin on him. Made the best men laugh throughout the service. Everyone done their bit. The fathers done their readings, James and I handed over the wedding rings and the bridesmaids looked good. Finally the proceedings ended, the happy couple walked back up the aisle and the Best Men, linked, arm in arm followed.</p><p>The happy couple posed for photo's outside, which if I haven't mentioned, was a lovely day weather wise. The confetti was sprinkled and the happy couple left in their old, black car towards to the reception, stopping off for a quick 10 minute breather.</p><p>Everyone got to the Hook House hotel safely (as far as we know!) and spilled out onto the lush lawns with their sparkling wine and orange juice. Barrie and Laura arrived and the hour photo session began. All sorts of photos were taken, including one where we had to hold Laura horizontally across our mid-rifts. Anyway Baz was steadily getting more grumpy that he had to smile in them! That boy doesn't like to smile too much!! He's probably taken up his whole year's supply of smiling up.</p><p>There was no time between the photo's and ushering the gatherings in for the wedding breakfast. This is when the best men were trying to sneak in all the props for their speech and getting everything ready. They looked remarkably relaxed, they even managed their meals. Mummy and I were on the same table as Daddy's friends and his mum and dad, as well as Ellie and Michael. We had melon for starter, chicken for main, and a choice between chocolate cake and fruit salad for pudding. The speeches started with David, Laura dad. He reminded everyone of Laura's mischiefness when she was a child. Bazza was then next to stand, and mentioned how it was Laura's dream, but his nightmare. I'm not sure if he was joking or not!! He also distributed some presents which was a nice touch and daddy got a 'Best Man' tankard. Then the attention turned to Daddy and James. Nervous. The first joke went off OK, the second even better, the picture gags were also a hit..... but it then seemed to dry up a bit on the laughs front. Still it is not all about the laughs. They gave a fair account of Baz and touched on all the right subjects. They stood for about 15 minutes before the nightmare over the past 14 months and especially last 3 months was over for them. People came up to them and said it went well.</p><p>Tables were cleared, beer could be consumed, and the evening guests began to arrive. The bouncy castle was a big hit for the kids. They certainly got their monies worth out of it. The cake was cut, and the disco man started the party. It was soon my bed time and luckily we had a room at the hotel for me to lie down in. Everyone took it in turns to come and baby-sit me during the night.</p><p>Auntie Susan and Graham turned up, as well as Grandpop and Grandma. Lots of chatting and drinking, and daddy even had a go on the bouncy castle with the rest of the boys. Unfortunately daddy received blows to the cheek, but Mr Aves managed to acquire a bloody nose. Mr King decided to come in with his knees at one point!!! He is dirt. Other highlights from the evening was when Joyce had so much to drink, she couldn't actually walk without assistance. Quite funny for us, but not for Steven or Joyce no doubt. Still people have laughed at daddy in the past, for similar misgivings. The evening guests had to finally leave around the 11pm mark, but the bar was re-opened for the hotel guests, of which there must have been up to 20 or so people. Daddy was absolutely knackered at 1am and finally turned in. A GOOD DAY HAD BY ALL.</p>

		<p>Us lot and Ellie and Michael went over to see Vicky in Penarth. Before that we battled through the traffic. It was the Division 1 play off final between West Ham and Crystal Palace. It took us 5 hours from Alton to Pontypool!!!! We stopped off for a bit of Windsurfing in some really scenic location in the Welsh hills near Pontypool.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/WindsurfingLake.jpg</src><caption>Llandegfedd Reservoir</caption></image><p>Finally a chance for Daddy to do some windsurfing when it's either not blowing a gale, or cold and rainy weather. We did however struggle for some wind, but I think there was enough to get some surfing done, dudes.... Vicky met us there and us girls just chatted by the water's edge. I think daddy is finally making some progress on the board. Uncle Michael must have the patience of a saint teaching him. Us girls went back slightly early to Penarth, coz it was my feeding and bed time. The grown-ups had a nice evening in with Fajita's and wine. Vicky kept getting phone calls from her new fella, Paul. What a comfy bed we slept in. Vicky went out with Paul at about 11 and did not return until 4am!!!</p>

		<p>As usual I gave out the 6:30am alarm call for all to wake.... However, only mummy and daddy seemed to respond to this. Us 3 went for a walk down through the parks of Penarth down to the seaside bit. I managed to convince mummy and daddy that I should be able to crawl on the pier, which I did. It was again a lovely sunny, hot day. We returned for breakfast before going out for another walk at Cosmeston Lakes Country Park (same place as last time). I had a go at the swings, so did daddy and Vicky. We came back for a spot of lunch before adventuring to IKEA for a few bits. I've finally got some blackout blinds so hopefully I'll sleep a bit longer in the mornings. We returned home in the late afternoon and flaked out.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_05_30-33-PenarthVickey.jpg</src><caption>Katie in Vicky’s back garden</caption></image>

    <title>Swanage</title>
    <info>
		<p>We done some jobs in the morning, but then we decided to spend the day just us 3 out somewhere. Daddy suggested Swanage which went down well. Both Mummy and Daddy haven't been there probably for about 15 or 20 years. We drove down to Poole and caught the ferry across to Studland Bay. We didn't see any nudist sun seekers.... probably because there was no sun, just a spot of rain.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_05_31-02-Swanage.JPG</src><caption>Having a kip on the way down</caption></image><p>Swanage itself was busy, people playing on the sandy beach, and of course rain. A typical, old-time, English, family holiday feel about the place. We had a big ice cream and walked in the town to the old Victorian pier. It was really a glorified pontoon, with loads and loads of divers there. The weather was a bit grim, but I still enjoyed watching the boats come in, and generally noseying around... in a Oldemor type way! I also got my first whiff of seaweed and I wasn't impressed. I turned my nose up as if daddy had done a fart!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_05_31-16-Swanage.JPG</src><caption>Swanage pier</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_05_31-17-Swanage.JPG</src><caption>Reaction after first smell of seaweed</caption></image><p>We slowly wandered back along the sea front, Daddy getting some local whelks before setting off towards Corfe Castle. It must be bank holiday weekend, as the weather was poor and the traffic even worse. We drove past Corfe Castle in the end, and headed off home.</p>

We took the customary long route to the NEC (mentioning no names, but Nick and Martin were the navigators). We eventually arrived, and boy did we do some laps. There was lots there to interest us, including the cars. Best stand was Subaru!! Nice to see the new Rolls Royce, and there were a couple of nice Seat's. The Ford stand had a massive Thunderbird show, which meant no one was looking at the cars. Anyway Nick has learnt a couple of things from the day. 1 - Buy a digital camera, 2 - Go to the Max Power show. Need we say more.</p><p>They stayed for about 5 hours. In the afternoon we sleepily, cruised down to Banbury to watch the England V Iceland game. We won 6-1. Dropped Nick off and went home.</p><p>Mummy and I went to Grandma and Grandpop's to stay the night. We went out with Grandpop shopping in the morning before returning to Surrey to take Mrs Oddie out</p>

    <title>Oliver's Christening</title>
    <info>
		<p>Woke at 5:30am. All 3 of us went for a long walk behind the barracks. We found a secret road, that had no traffic. Not one car passed. Not on the map. It was deep in the woods going between one area of the barracks to another. It was a lovely hot day, and I managed to get a bit of sleep.</p><p>Daddy cleaned the cars inside and out, and mowed the lawns before we went to St Andrew's, Frimley Green to see Oliver's christening. We went back to Oliver's house for a celebration buffet and drink before collapsing back at home.</p>

    <title>Charlotte look after and Guerka Cross</title>
    <info>
		<p>Charlotte looked after me today as Mummy was school nursing. In the evening mummy and daddy went out with Karen and Richard to the Guerka Cross, Nepalese restaurant in Fleet. It was quite strange as the village that Karen stayed in was close to the one that a couple of the Guerka's had grown up. They even knew the same people. Daddy would love to go there one day when I am older perhaps. The food was lovely, almost like an Indian really. Charlotte, Ellie and Michael baby sat f r me in the evening.</p>

    <title>Alice Holt and Guildford</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went over to Clare Park, Farnham for Laura's hospital appointment. She was a lot happier when she came out. We then took a country drive through Crondall and Bentley which was very picturesque, and headed for Alice Holt Park. We went for a nice walk in there. We explored one of the walks and didn't go for all the fun, play stuff. Somewhere to come back to definitely.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_06_12-10-AliceHolt.jpg</src>\<caption>Alice Holt Country Park</caption></image><p>The afternoon was spent preparing for the big BBQ tomorrow. Shopping, cleaning, getting stuff ready.</p><p>In the evening Karen and Richard came round to baby sit. They however, were supposed to be a hosting a night for their friends Justin and Lauren. So they done it our house. Anyway I kept walking up, so ended up sleeping in Karen's arms. Mummy and Daddy went off to watch the Harry Potter, Prisoner of Kaza... something or other film. Daddy loved it, mummy wasn't so sure.</p>

    <title>England V France BBQ</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went over to the Fars to visit them for half an hour. Mummy and I went to church whilst daddy stayed at the Fars.</p><p>The BBQ party started in the afternoon. The girls stayed in the back garden sunning themselves, whilst 9 boys went to play gold at Windlemere. It was carnage on the golf course. Dawg almost got hit 2 or 3 times. Barrie was constantly in the bushes and swearing. He even swore at some innocent bystanders, thinking Daddy was there!! Anyway after a bit of help from daddy's cheat book he came second in the group. Mr Aves won it overall. After a spectacular entrance to the car park, and equally good handbrake turnout was ensured. 9 holes + a beer was completed in just over 3 hours! We got back to the abode, and started the BBQ - Mr Rowe got the first burger!!! Anyway just about finished in time for the football. What a game. England were 1-0 up until the 90 minute, when France managed to get two very late goals. It kind of killed the party a bit. Everyone was gutted.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_06_13-03-EnglandFranceBBQ.jpg</src><caption>Watching England V France (Euro 2004)</caption></image>

    <title>Denmark Holiday - travelling</title>
    <first name="katie">Flying on a aeroplane</first>
    <info>
		<p>We went to Copenhagen with Ellie and Michael this time around and stayed at Lise and Jørgen's flat. Their first time to Denmark and mine! Daddy, Ellie and Michael all had to go to work during the day. It was going to be a bit of a rush to Gatwick. The Fars took us by car. After an initial scare that Ellie had her passport in a different name to the one on her tickets, we got on the plane. It was early evening which meant it was time for my bottle. As soon as I had that I settled down on the plane. I don't know what the fuss is about otherwise, plane flying is easy-peasy. The flight took an hour and forty minutes. It was a cloudy day, so we couldn't see much other than when we took off (over towards Maidstone) and when we landed.</p><p>We landed fine, and proceeded to make our way using the 2A bus to Postparken. Trouble was Mummy and Daddy couldn't remember where Lise and Jørgen lived. After a few circuits, we eventually were warmly greeted by our Danish friends. We had a good night's sleep</p>

    <title>Denmark Holiday - Copenhagen Tour</title>
    <info>
		<p>We woke and got some morn brød from the baker and took the lot round the Lise and Jørgen summer house and had a traditional Danish breakfast. It was scrummy.</p><p>We then ventured into Radhuseplassen and started to walk up Strøget. The weather was terrible, windy and rainy. We popped into a few of the shops but I don't think Ellie and Michael were too impressed with the prices. C'est trop cher. We had a pølser from the pølservogn, which was tasty, then climbed up the Round Tower to see the views of Copenhagen.</p><p>Our tour continued towards Kongs Nytorg and Nyhavn, before catching a bus out from the centre to Pedersen's Famille Havn for a meal with Lise, Jørgen and Oldemor. We all chose the same dish, which was a sausage and bacon casserole. It was nice to see Mormor again. She was happy to see Katie and of course us lot.</p><p>We returned home, I went to bed, and everyone else relaxed watching the Euro championships</p>

    <title>Denmark Holiday - Church, Little Mermaid, Canal Ride and Tivoli</title>
    <info>
		<p>The weather started a little better today. After our Danish pastry breakfast, we ventured into the city centre again and met up with Lise and Jørgen. The ladies went to church, whilst me and the boys had a walk up Langelinie and had a relaxing beer by the water front.</p><p>We then all went to see the little mermaid and had our picture taken there. We said goodbye to Lise and Jørgen and continued along the water’s edge to the Palace and eventually Holmen's Church, where we caught a canal boat tour. The heavens opened and the wind was gusting. Michael spent most of the time under an umbrella trying to sleep. It wasn't pleasant at all and we all couldn't wait to get off. We headed for some food.</p><p>The weather improved and we made our way over to Christiana, the hippy town. It is a really weird place... especially to live there. A shanty town for the liberal minded.</p><p>After our little walk, we headed to Tivoli. Woo hoo. It was nice as ever. It was still light so we didn't actually see any of the light on, but it still feels a magical place. We had a few goes on some rides, including a really good roller coaster. Daddy went on the ride that drops you 150ft from the sky. He's a brave man. We headed home warily and quite happy for a rest.</p>

    <title>Denmark Holiday - Aquarium, Bakken, Smorbrød</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy, Daddy and I let Ellie and Michael have a lie in today so we went down to the beach bit close to the flat. We saw jelly fish in the clean water. We could see Sweden and the bridge that crosses the waters. We got the pastries and came back to wake the other 2 up.</p><p>We caught the bus, metro and train to Charlottelund, and walked through the park to get to the Aquarium. I love to see all the fish, although I was a bit scared of the bigger fish, especially the sharks!! Even though I banged on the fish tanks none of the fish seemed to want to speak to me.</p><p>We got a bus to Klampenborg and walked to Bakken, which is like an old fashioned theme park in the middle of the woods. A bit more basic than Tivoli, but equally as enjoyable. Daddy and Michael spent a long time in the Fun House. Kids!! Also they went on with mummy onto the old wooden roller coaster. Daddy also beat Michael at the football game. Well done Dad.</p><p>We relaxed on the beach for a while before returning home. We later went over to Lise and Jørgen summer house for traditional Danish smorbrød. Mormor was there to. We had frikadeller, herrings, shrimps and egg sandwiches. They were scrummy.</p><p>Afterwards we all went up to the Flat to watch England win against the Swiss</p>

    <title>Denmark Holiday - Carlsberg, Zoo, Swimming, Radhuseplassen</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went to Carlsberg today and walked around the museum. We each had a voucher to sample of couple of the beers. Mmmm. Daddy and Michael could have stayed there all day. It was very good because it was all free.</p><p>In the afternoon we went to the zoo whilst Ellie and Michael went for a walk in Fredericksberg Havn. I loved the zoo. So many animals to see and wave to. But favourite was the fish again.</p><p>We bussed it to the swimming baths on Godhabsvej and went for a swim. The others thought it was a bit strict and cold. Daddy liked it as it was the place he went to when he was a child.</p><p>The boys stopped off at Radhuseplassen and took one of the free bikes and circled around the city centre for a while. Us girls went back to the flat. Lise came around to watch the Denmark V Sweden game and played card games. Jørgen met up with the boys and watched the game in Radhuseplassen along with 5,000 other Danes on a big screen TV. The atmosphere was great. Very patriotic and friendly. Denmark got a good result which meant they proceeded into the knock out stages. The boys celebrated in an Irish bar until the early hours of the morning.</p>

    <info>
		<p>We caught the train to Roskilde and walked through the town, getting Daddy a Denmark football top (from Ellie and Michael as a birthday present), towards the Viking boat museum. They were reconstructing a long ship from scratch using just using materials and tools that they would have used. Daddy could have spent a lot longer there, but we had to return and get ready to fly home. Daddy went to Oldemor's to help her get to the airport, whilst us lot went back to pack.</p><p>The flight home was OK, if delayed, and the Fars came to collect us. Daddy looked after Oldemor through the airport. He saved his legs by going on the 'buggy'.</p><p>Overall a good holiday, but I think we tired the Elder's out by trying to fit too much in.</p>

		<p>This year Mummy got a brand new mountain bike, helmets, bike rack and bike child seat. This means we can go on nice family bike rides. However, mummy doesn't do hills, so we are having to pick routes that are flat. What better than canals. Our mission is to do the whole of the grand union canal, so today we started at Brentford and rode up to Bulls Bridge in Hayes.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_06_25-01-LauBDay-GrandUnionCanal.JPG</src><caption>Grand Union Canal ride</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_06_25-04-LauBDay-GrandUnionCanal.JPG</src><caption>Grand Union Canal ride</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_06_25-05-LauBDay-GrandUnionCanal.JPG</src><caption>Grand Union Canal ride</caption></image>

I absolutely loved the swings on a roundabout. After a bit of shopping we went to Peter and Andrea's birthday bash at the Basingstoke Canal.</p>

    <title>Finkley Down Farm and Iron Maiden Tribute Band</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went with Farmor, Farfar and Oldemor to Finkley Down Farm near Andover. Another farm to add to Katie's list. There were plenty of animals to see. We held a rabbit. I liked getting reasonable close to the animals, but I didn't like to touch them, or them touching me. I loved the chickens as they made such cool noises, which I tried to imitate.</p><p>After our lovely picnic, we went to see the donkey's, horses, pigs and cows. We had a cup of tea in the tea shop before returning home.</p><p>In the evening Daddy, cycled to Nicks, then walked to the Tumbledown Dick in Farnborough with Nick and Martin, stopping off for a swift drink at the Prince of Wales on the way. He met Phil there and they saw an Iron Maiden tribute band. All black t-shirts and long hair. A sight not seen the 90s. Phil lost his pint of beer when he put it on the speaker and the base, bounced it off. A cracking night.</p>

    <title>Daddy's 29th Birthday - Cotswold's Wildlife Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>Laura had done a night so came in about 8am. We got ready and went round to the Fars for a birthday breakfast and to open presents and cards. Daddy got a spirit level from Mummy. Great! Anyway we proceeded on our mystery tour. So mysterious, mummy took us all over the place, she didn't even seem to know where we were going.</p><p>We eventually ended up at the Cotswold's Wildlife Park. We waited for a heavy shower to pass before getting out to see all the animals, which I loved. We saw tortoises, zebras, rhino's (which I was very interested in), leopards, an ostrich, some cheeky monkeys, pigs, goats, ducks, snakes, bats (which I wasn't sure about) and penguins.</p><p>We had a really nice time, and were all tired afterwards. So much so that we had a sleep when we got home. Mummy made a special Indian meal. At about 8pm me and mummy went to sleep.</p>

We had a picnic with Grandpop and Grandma afterwards.</p><p>Mummy then went to bed to prepare for her night shift tonight. Daddy and I went round to the Fars. We all then went down to see the Frimley Carnival. It was bigger than ever. I had a go on the mini steam train with Daddy and Farmor, which I absolutely loved. I bounced on Farmor's knee all of the way. We watched the kids football and ate most of Daddy's Ice Cream.</p><p>In the evening I managed to walk 3 steps without any help for the first time. From the middle of the front room to the big sofa. I'm so clever. :)</p>

    <title>Tank Driving - Windsurfing - RAT Train - Elder Announcement</title>
    <info>
		<p>A busy day today, largely spent without Daddy. Mummy and I went to the Elder household for the day. Ellie told us that she was 12 weeks pregnant! :) What great news for Auntie Ellie and Uncle Michael. That means I will have a cousin, and a new play mate. Child of Elder can be taught some tricks of mine!</p><p>Myself, well I am getting into this walking. It's easy. I can now walk the length of the living room unaided, and walking is my new thing I'm into. Don't want to play so much. I just want to walk places. Of course I have a few falls. But no bad scrapes just yet.</p><p>While we were at the Elder's, Daddy was with the Far's at a Tank Driving experience in the morning. Farmor drove a Chieftan, an Abbot, a armoured personnel carrier and a quad bike that was very powerful. Farmor enjoyed driving all of them except the quad bikes, which were a bit too powerful for her. She carried 20 people as passengers on the Chieftan. Daddy and Farfar were allowed to be passengers on a couple of tanks, but were there to support Farmor during the morning.</p><p>Daddy then went to meet up with Michael, to go windsurfing down at Hayling Island. The conditions weren't great. But Daddy is getting frustrated that he can't do it that easily. I'm sure with a bit more practice he'll get it.</p><p>We were joined at the Elders, by the Weston's and Howard's. After our nice meal, mummy had to do a night shift in the evening, whilst the boys went on the 'Real Ale Steam Train' that runs from Alton to Alresford (Bluebell Railway). There were quite a few strange looking people on the strange. Strangely enough a cross between real ale drinkers: half bald, half long hair, beer bellied, middle aged men, and train spotters: grey haired, middle aged men. Anyway tried 4 or 5 beers out. The best being Trotten beer.</p>

    <title>Gay Family Lunch</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went to church as usual. In the afternoon we slept as mummy had done a night shift. Daddy went over for a family meal at the Far's, which Susan and Graham also graced us with their presence. They had lovely roast lamb and chicken. Daddy's favourites. Mummy and I woke up and came round for desserts. Afterwards, we strolled up to Borrowhill school for their fete and I showed off, how much walking I could do. :)</p><p>In the evening Steven popped around to give Daddy a birthday present.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Mummy had to go to the hospital, so while we were waiting Daddy and I went for a bike ride into Farnham, had some lunch in a nice garden, then biked up those hills again. I wasn't a happy camper. I was so tired. I even fell asleep on the bumpy ride back to the hospital. We got back and mummy was OK to leave for home.</p><p>In the evening Grandma, Grandpop and Auntie Charlotte came to stay the night, but they arrived too late for me to see.</p>

    <title>My First Birthday and Nigel's 50th</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy made us get up at 6:30am so I could open my presents downstairs in the front room. Grandma, Grandpop and Auntie Charlotte where there to see me open them. I got so many nice cards and presents.</p><p>Our visitors left to go on holiday. Mummy and Daddy had lots to do to prepare for my party. We had 25 people expected to come for my birthday party. Lucky the weather was good so everyone could go in the back garden. Lorraine and Joshua came across from next door to help us out.</p><p>Guest started arriving at midday. Daddy was doing the BBQ, although almost blew everyone up, when he forgot to tighten the gas pipe properly. The gas pipe caught light! Fortunately he switched the gas before the gas cylinder blew up. Me and my friends had so many new toys to play with. Everyone was so generous.</p><p>Later we played pass the parcel and musical chairs. Great Grandma won both! Then daddy brought the birthday cake out and everyone sang happy birthday. Although the ladybird cake looked very professional, unfortunately it wasn't very edible. We continued till 3 o'clock-ish. There was lots of clearing up to do.</p><p>We then went off to Gillingham to go to Uncle Nigel's 50th birthday celebration. On the way we stopped off at Buckmore Park to watch David Hump race for 10 minutes. Mummy and Daddy could finally relax which was nice. It was good to catch up with everyone again. I managed to play with some boys and their cars, which was sweet. The BBQ put ours to shame. It was superb. It was the first time I met William. He's a funny man, with his stories. We saw pictures from Fee and Kelly's honeymoon in the Maldives, and it looked like paradise. Clear water and a small island. The hooligan that was caught in the Euro championships and who was on front of all the national papers was also there! Daddy was joking and stirring up trouble, without knowing that we were sat next to his family!! Still lucky Daddy is so discrete.</p><p>We left at about 9:30 so I could get to bed. We had another busy day planned for tomorrow.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_07_22-02-KatieBirthdayCake.JPG</src><caption>Birthday Cake</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_07_24-01-KatieBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Opening cards in the morning</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_07_24-05-KatieBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Playing on my new keyboard</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_07_24-06-KatieBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Reading my new book</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_07_24-07-KatieBirthday.jpg</src><caption>The back garden.

    <title>Farnborough Air Show and Going On Holiday</title>
    <info>
		<p>Karen very kindly managed to get us some free tickets to get in to the air show this year. We started off early, because we all know how busy it gets. We drove over to Zebon Copse to collect our friends. The weather again was good. We parked up inside the airfield and made our way straight to the parachute jump area. Daddy, Karen and Richard all had a go. You climb this scaffold tower, which is 100 foot in the air, and just jump off! Very good.</p><p>Next Daddy tried some glass painting with me, but I didn't really grasp what was going on. Still Daddy finished it off. We looked around a couple of stands before the air show began. Karen made this really nice picnic for us all, which we were able to eat at her company's box. Some of the airplanes were really loud, my face was a picture of scared confusion when they became really loud. I didn't cry though. I pointed out the helicopters and stuff. I was more interested in walking around the box area and going up to people. Mummy liked the Hornet the most, Daddy loved the Spitfire and F16. We continued to walk around to see the planes on the ground for a bit before it was time for us to leave.</p><p>Daddy drove us, via Ellie's, to Portsmouth where we caught a hovercraft over to the Isle of Wight to start our 3 day holiday. Daddy unfortunately had to go and work.</p>

    <title>North Downs ride, Henry Birthday, Swimming</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy was working nights all weekend, which meant Daddy and I had to get out of the house to let her sleep. As it was such a nice sunny day Daddy and I decided to go off cycling. We drove to Ash and rode up and over the Hogs Back and eventually picked up the North Downs trail. I fell asleep on the back of the bike as, Daddy was working hard getting up all of the big hills. We must have cycled for an hour and a half before reaching Guildford. We saw some nice butterflies and flowers on the way which I always like to point out. I marvelled everyone with my smile and walking capabilities up Guildford high street. We got some milk and strawberries and sat by the river, under a tree and we got fed and watered. We caught the train back to Ash and quickly drove home.</p><p>It was my friend's, Henry's birthday today. We went around to his house to celebrate. He's got some cool toys. I particularly liked the 'water table' which Oliver and I played with. Also I managed to let myself go on the slide. I'm so brave. I've decided I really don't care for the swings anymore. Old hat I finks! It was boiling, and maybe I got a bit of heat stroke, as when we left I was sick! Unlucky for Daddy. We dropped off Mummy for another little sleep - Daddy and I returned back to Camberley and went swimming.</p><p>I tested out my lungs in the changing rooms. Daddy gave up trying to put my swimming costume on, but we had fun in the swimming pool. My favourites are when I dunk daddy's head under the water, and he comes up and surprises me. I also like splashing around and noseying at the other children in the pool. For those who weren't around for my first performance, I managed to make an even louder noise in the changing rooms on the way out. Daddy and I were only half dressed when we left!</p>

    <title>Church, Footie Training</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy got home from her night shift. Daddy and I went for a long walk over to the woods and picked some nice flowers for Mummy. I then went to church which was OK. Daddy couldn't leave Casuals alone, and we had to go over and watch the boys train. It did mean I could go on a new playground. Shock, horror, Daddy took me for the weekly food shop in the big Tesco's. It went surprisingly well. Dad prized me with grapes and kept blowing in my face which was funny. After a very late lunch we played in the paddling pool in the back garden which was great fun. I managed to soak Daddy, no problem. It was such a hot day, so the pool was the best place to be. Mummy and I took Mrs Oddie to go see her son as well.</p><p>It will be nice to spend a day with both Mummy and Daddy. It hasn't actually happened very often recently.</p>

It was a really hot day, and it was packed with people.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_08_07-02a-Tilford.jpg</src><caption>Playing at the river in Tilford</caption></image>

    <title>Brighton Bike Ride</title>
    <info>
		<p>After church, Daddy drove us on this hot, muggy day down to Shoreham By Sea. The plan was to ride along the 6 mile seafront to Brighton. However, nothing is ever that straight forward. We started off, and spent ages riding and we were not seeing much of the sea. Instead there is a large industrial estate. We hit the promenade at Hove, where we stopped for some lunch and a nice play in the paddling pool and playground. We continued on to Brighton which was really busy with loads of people on the beach. We parked our bikes and we all walked around a few shops. It took a while because I wanted to explore every single shop and interesting thing en-route. We eventually caught the train back to Shoreham and returned back home exhausted.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_08_08-09a-Brighton.jpg</src><caption>The promenade at Hove</caption></image>

    <title>Soft Play, Training and Shopping</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy was working again this weekend, which meant it was just me and Daddy to challenge the world today. We went early to the Arena to Creepy Crawlies. It was 'soft play', which meant lots of objects that you could crash into. There was a ball pool and a bouncy castle assault course. I think I was a bit young for all of that. The other kids there were a bit older. I was quite content walking around, nosing into other people’s business and watching the other children play. I did a lot of running around and kicked one of the balls around. Daddy was very pleased with me.</p><p>We then went over to watch Casuals train. There were only 5 players that turned up again. We went to play in the playground. So much playing today. Great. We had to do the shopping this week, so Daddy took us to the Meadows and spent 2 hours there!!! I ate lots of grapes!</p><p>We got home for a late lunch and some playing. Mummy then played with me whilst Daddy went out with his friends to watch the football down the pub.</p>

		<p>In the morning Mummy and I went to church leaving Daddy to do jobs.</p><p>It was Farfar's 58th birthday. We went round to have a sausage and mash lunch, before venturing over to Bocketts Farm near Leatherhead. It was a wicked place. There was pig racing and lots of play areas for children like me. We also saw some horses, donkeys, chicken, peacocks, rabbits, etc, etc. I loved it there.</p><p>In the evening we watched Paula Radcliffe crash out of the Olympics women’s' marathon. She was so distraught.</p>

    <title>Charlotte and Marina's Leaving Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>Charlotte and Marina were about to slide off to New Zealand for several months, so it was decided we should have a party to celebrate. The party was at the Weston's abode. Daddy helped setup, whilst mummy and I went off to church. There were 60 people expected throughout the day. It started at midday.</p><p>It was manic as usual, and luckily the weather held out. There was a nice BBQ as well.</p><p>Daddy and I went to see the open air concert at the community centre field. There were some fun inflatable to play on. We felt sorry for the acts having to compete with the indifferent weather.</p><p>Come 6 o'clock all of Charlotte and Marina's friends began to arrive. Time for Mummy and Daddy to escape to the pictures to watch Bourne Supremacy at Bluewater, whilst myself, Grandma and Grandpop went to Marina's house to get out of the way. I was a pickle for Grandma!! Mummy and Daddy finished the night having some cocktails and a meal in TGI Friday's.</p>

		<p>After church Mummy and I went over to watch Daddy play in his first game for Casuals this season. It was just a friendly, but it was a baking hot day to play football. I think Casuals lost 3-2, but it was a spirited performance.</p><p>In the afternoon we went over to Hollycombe Steam fair. There were lots of rides for me to go on. I went on the swinging chairs, the ghost house, gallopers, carousel, big wheel and the car roundabout. Farmor and Farfar joined us as well. We also went on the Steam Engine and went for a walk and said hello to the horses. A great afternoon out.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_09_05-01-HollycombeSteam.JPG</src><caption>Hollycombe Steam Collection - Mummy</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_09_05-10-HollycombeSteam.JPG</src><caption>Hollycombe - In My Car</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_09_05-14-HollycombeSteam.JPG</src><caption>Hollycombe - On Train With Farfar</caption></image><p>In the evening, Daddy finally managed to sell his car for 1450.

    <title>Longleat Safari Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went to Longleat Safari Park to see all the animals. We knew Katie would love it. We started by going around seeing giraffes and camels. Katie sat in the front with the grown up's, and said "look" to all the animals, as if she wanted to show us! We then went around to the monkeys where one clambered on to our car which was very exciting and hitched a lift. When the monkey decided to get off, he took half the windscreen wiper as well!!! We moved onto see lions and tigers. After the safari park bit we had a picnic looking at the big stately home, then went to look at pet world and have ago on the little train ride around the park. Daddy tried and failed on the big hedge maze. We also tried the mirror maze and the mining tour, where mummy ran out screaming because of a bat. Daddy got stung by a wasp as well! We finally went on the paddle tour boat and saw some sea lions getting fed which was wicked, as they got so close to us. We also saw some gorilla's and hippos. Mummy and Daddy have never seen me so happy.</p><p>I have got another 2 or maybe 3 teeth coming through.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_09_06-15-LongleatSafariPark.JPG</src><caption>A Longleat Smile</caption></image>

    <title>Auction and London Parks</title>
    <info>
		<woops rating="8" woopstitle="The Carpet Needs Ironing"><p>In the morning mummy decided to burn an iron mark into the living room carpet!!!! The carpet is ruined.</p><image woopstitle="The Carpet Needs Ironing" forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_09_07-MummuysIroning-01-.JPG</src><caption>Mummy and her ironing!!</caption></image></woops><p>Anyway in the morning Daddy went with Farfar to the Chertsey auctions. It was good there. So many lots up for auctions. All end of line or bankrupt stock goods. There was a big argument between one of the officials and an Albanian. Quite funny really. Mummy and I done the weekly food shop.</p><p>In the afternoon we went by train up to London and done lots of walking. The weather was really hot again, so it was nice. We started by going across the Thames, to Trafalgar Square, through to St James's park where we fed the ducks, talked to the geese and got close up to the pelicans. I kept saying "duck, duck" to all the birdies, and kept trying to go up to them all. I think I would spend all day there if mummy and daddy didn't keep moving me on! We saw Buckingham Palace, walked through Green Park, up to Piccadilly Circus where we stopped for some lunch. We then walked all the way back up to Hyde Park and went through the nice gardens, stopped off under the kissing tree, walked passed some more ducks in the serpentine until we eventually got to Princess Diana's memorial fountain. There wasn't actually a fountain there, but more of a looped toboggan run with streaming water. It was fun to put my feet in the cold water. Very refreshing. I had a bit of a run around in the grassy bit in the middle and played with another boy for a bit, before we caught a bus back to Charing Cross and walked back to Waterloo station. Then daddy decided to get lost, so mummy and I travelled alone back to Woking, leaving daddy searching around a packed, rush hour station for us. We eventually found each other back at Woking. We shot home and relaxed in the evening. We must have walked for 5 miles today!!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_09_07-08-LondonParks.JPG</src><caption>Outside Buckingham Palace</caption></image>

    <title>Swimming, Tumble Tots</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy got his haircut, then we went over to Basingstoke and went in the best pool for kids. There was a slide that I got up myself, and lots of animals to point at. It was nice a quiet as well.</p><p>In the afternoon, mummy went for her weekly medical appointment!!! leaving Daddy to take me to tumble tots class. You should have seen Daddy and Dan trying to put the car seat in Dan's car. I think I would have done it quicker! Tumble tots was OK. Lots for me to do there.</p>

    <title>Trains, Cats and Automobiles - Isle Of Wight</title>
    <info>
		<p>Another glorious day. We set off early (goes without saying), and drove down to Portsmouth Harbour, caught the catamaran over to Ryde where we had an old underground train waiting for us. This took us to Shanklin, where we travelled on a Bus to Blackgang Chine, via a short stop in Ventnor.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_09_09-02-IsleOfWight.JPG</src><caption>Ventnor coastline</caption></image><p>Blackgang Chine is brilliant for kids of about 4 to 6 years old. Lots of difference things to see. My favourite bit of course was the 'Pet Shop', where there were different animals on display. Mummy and daddy don't understand the love for animals, as they are not big pet fans. We spent quite a few hours in there moving along the windy paths going up and down the cliff.</p><p>We ventured back to Shanklin, and went into the Chine where t ere was a big waterfall and lots of overhanging tree's. It was very peaceful in there.</p><p>We then made our way home, getting fish and chips on the way. I enjoyed the train journey back to Ryde as I had a big audience to show off in front off. An exhausting day out.</p>

    <title>Bognor, Chichester, Lindey's Wedding</title>
    <info>
		<p>We travelled down south in the morning to Bognor Regis. It was very windy and not all that warm. I enjoyed walking along the promenade and along the pier. I had a thing for eating the pebbles on the beech as well. We walked around the town and made our way back to the car.</p><p>Daddy had just bought a spare key for mummy's car. He unlocked the car OK with it, but couldn't get the car started. We were there for about 15 minutes trying, and opening the bonnet, until Mummy said to try the normal key. This worked. Phew!!</p><p>We moved onto Chichester, only 15 minutes away. We parked up and looked for a wedding present for Lindey. It was a really nice Market kind of town.</p><p>We shot off to Eashing for Lindey's afternoon celebrations at her and Rob's house. It was cool there as there were 4 or 5 other children there, and new toys to play with. The 'do' itself was very nice, with loads of marquee's in the garden and nice food. All the usual suspects were there. Grandma had a very interesting chat with Lindey's brother about what he got up to the night before. Grandma came back shaking. :)</p>

    <title>Biggin Hill Air Show</title>
    <info>
		<p>After enjoying the Farnborough Air Show, mummy treated us all to go to the Biggin Hill Air Show. Daddy was particularly looking forward to it, as it was supposed to be commemorating the Battle Of Britain. However, there were just 2 American WWII planes. No spitfires!! Boo hoo.</p><p>Anyway we enjoyed the scenic route to Biggin Hill, so close to London, yet so much lovely countryside. There was a fair and plenty of stalls and tents to amuse us. We saw Bleroit's plane which was the first to fly the channel.</p><p>We saw a F16, Some WWI replica planes which struggled against the wind, a formation flying display, like the red arrows, an army helicopter convoy, which looked impressive. But our favourite from Farnborough is still our favourite here.... The Harrier Jump Jet. Impressive how it can sit in the sky and go up and down at 90 degrees and even go backwards. Defo the best.</p><p>The weather was on the turn a bit and Katie was developing a cold, so we headed back home again.</p>

    <info>
		<p>I think we'll rename Daddy as 'Daddy Disaster'. He bashed Mummy's car into the side of the garage. We were supposed to go cycling and forgot my seat, so we couldn't!</p><p>Anyway we went over to see Kelly and Fiona in their new house in Kenley. It was really nice. We also saw Kelly's new big bike. A killing machine and no mistake.</p><p>We then went over to Caterham to try and find a soft play place, but we couldn't find it. We then went home to drop the bikes off and went to another soft play place that was in Mummy's book. It was over in Knaphill. However it was about 10 square foot. It entertained her for about 5 minutes..... Mummy turn for a disaster.</p><p>We came home and had some nice play time.... then David and Louise came over. Louise is 7 weeks pregnant and we heard about their move to Australia.</p>

    <title>Alton Feelers</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy (mainly) and Daddy have decided they would like to move to Alton. So we all went over after Daddy's work. Uncle Michael kindly babysat for me, whilst mummy and daddy cased the town out and checked some of the pubs (Eight Bells and Swan Hotel) and of course the fish and chip shop. I think they found some properties they liked the look of all about the 230K - 250K mark.</p><p>First there are things in the house that need to be done in order to sell it. Secondly the house opposite is up for 270K, which seems expensive. If we come onto the market, then we fear of a bidding type war occurring. Thirdly we got to find out what sort of mortgage we can afford, especially now that Mummy is sort of working part-time.</p><p>Lots to do, but quite exciting really. Hopefully we'll move to a house that has got more character, in an area that has amenities and parks within walking distance. Also it helps with Ellie and Michael living in the same town.</p>

We decided to put the sail up. We were going for quite a while until Daddy took the tiller and within 20 seconds the boat was zig zagging and rolling violently from side to side. The boom unexpectedly came whipping across and knocked poor Uncle Michael on the head. It was lucky he wasn't knocked off the boat or anyone injured.</p><p>Daddy's stint at the tiller ended and Mummy's call for "mota, mota" were finally heeded, and we motored to Queenborough.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2001/2001_05_20-BarbarTrip07.jpg</src><caption>Captain 'Uncle Albert' Gay</caption></image></woops><p>Just got to mention the lovely lunch we had. Sounds simple, but it was 'crepe suset'. Cheese ploughman’s. Mmmm</p><p>We eventually got to Queenborough, where there was a grumpy man who wouldn't let us moor against his boat. Don't understand people like that. Anyway the next boat along couldn't be friendlier, helping us moor and even took me in his arms when we were clambering off.</p><p>The boys went to the pub, whilst us girls went for a walk around. We later joined the boys, just after daddy took me on a walk down the sludgy, muddy spit to the sea.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_10_02-11-SailingQueenborough.JPG</src><caption>Queenborough - Thames Estuary</caption></image><p>We had a lovely dinner and went back to the boat. I was snuggled to bed, whilst the grownups played Triv Pursuit. Of course the brainy boys thrashed the girlies.</p><p>The boys headed off home in record time. Queenborough to Deepcut in 1hr 5mins!!! 90-100mph all the way back. Fantastico.</p>

		<p>The usual routine on Sunday morning, football and church. I can't be left in crèche anymore. I much prefer it with the grownups in church. Far more attention to be gained!!</p><p>It was a lovely sunny day. In the afternoon we set off to Odds Farm Park. It was a rare breeds farm, and of course I loved seeing all the animals. I never like going to close. When an animal comes close to me, I cry a bit. Otherwise, I do this stooping thing to look at the animals, to check them out first. I can say duck and puppy and I sometimes say "hi" to the animals. we went on a tractor ride, and Daddy let me go on this really fast slide in the playground. I absolutely loved it. Farms are my favourite day out by far.</p>

    <title>Puddles and Ellie and Michael</title>
    <first name="katie">Sore Throat</first>
    <info>
		<p>We had quite a busy day. Daddy and I went to pick Mummy up from work at 7:30am, as her car has gone into the repairers at last. Daddy cleaned and fixed the oven, then we went to Camberley to find a present for Uncle Graham. Daddy had forgotten it was his birthday during the week. Anyway we found a cool present for him. A Pink Floyd DVD. We went over to Auntie Susan and Grahams to drop off the present and have a cup of tea.</p><p>After lunch we headed over to Farnborough and for some reason went into Maplin's as it was their opening day. I only mention it because they had a robot man there which I couldn't stop staring at. He came up to me and sang Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, and done some Michael Jackson moves. Fascinating!</p><p>We were going to 'soft play' but the weather had seemed to cheer up and decided in the end to go to the Lookout. I had my new wellies and loved going through the puddles, then back again through the puddles again. Once in the puddles, I made these little splashes by stamping in the water. What fun. However, I fell over a couple of times and got soaked, so it wasn't long till we had to go back home again.</p><p>Grandma, Grandpop, Cherie popped over for a quick cup of tea before they went off for the evening. By this stage I had practically lost my voice, and I couldn't even cry very loud. Grandma asked for a biscuit and I duly obliged by going to the kitchen and getting the biscuit tin. However, I ate the biscuits myself!</p><p>Ellie and Michael also came over for a meal and to watch Lost In translation. I don't think many of us thought much of the film. Ellie and Michael stayed the night, but I didn't really go to sleep until 2am, as I was so poorly.</p>

    <title>Claremont Landscaped Gardens</title>
    <info>
		<p>After a bad night’s sleep we done the usual routine. Boys to football and us girls to church.</p><p>In the afternoon the three of us went to Claremont Landscaped Gardens. A National Trust place in Esher. It was a lovely scenic, relaxing place. There was a big lake, with lots of ducks and even more importantly, puddles! we had a lovely walk, however, I ended up falling over in a puddle and soaking my peachy bottom. Seeing that I had already got a cold, we didn't spend too much longer there until we rushed back to a nice warm house.</p>

    <title>Me, Katie</title>
    <first name="katie">Ate my dinner by myself with a spoon</first>
    <info>
		<p>I am becoming so clever these days. I am babbling allot and sometimes say the odd word like; Mummy, Daddy, Duck and Baby.</p><p>I can understand simple things like 'get your shoes', 'get mummy a biscuit!!' and 'no', although I tend to burst out crying for this one.</p><p>I am also very clingy to mummy. If I am with Mummy and then she leaves the room, then I will starting crying for her for anything from 5 to 20 minutes. It is very difficult for Daddy to get close to me sometimes :(</p><p>I am also a pickle at night times. In the past week, I have been waking up at 4:30am and not settling down again, unless Mummy comes in to sleep on my bedroom floor. What a pickle</p><p>When I am not tired I am easily pleased and happy, and really like to play with all my toys very quickly. I most of all like sorting things out, like leaflets, or clothes in drawers, DVDs or books even.</p><p>My favourite though has got to be going out for walks and visiting farms and animals. I enjoy going to 'soft play' as well.</p><p>Today, Mummy cooked a shepherd’s pie for me. I ate it on my high chair and scooped the dinner out myself with my spoon. Some ended up on my cardigan, but I did manage to eat a lot. I am becoming more and more independent.</p>

    <info>
		<p>After Farmor visited us in the morning fresh back from her trip from Copenhagen, and a half hour visit to Grandma and her parents (listening to their nightmare story in France), we went off to Polesden Lacey, near Great Bookham, a National Trust home and grounds.</p><p>A lovely Autumns day and we started by having lunch on the nice lawns of the house overlooking the North Downs. It was a lovely big mansion and a nice view. We done some walking, and more walking and finally it was time to look around the house. There were allot of posh people there, and a lot of guides to help and ask questions. It was an Edwardian house with still allot of the original features in it. Funny to see the old gramophone being wound up. Some of the rooms looked very opulent (word for the day).</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_10_30-04-PolesdenLacey.JPG</src><caption>Having lunch at Polesden Lacey</caption></image><p>Anyway I had to be carried all of the way around, because for some reason no one trusted that I wouldn't go up to stuff and wreck 'em like I only know how. Even Daddy got told off for touching stuff!</p><p>We went around to the stables area and had tea, and done some more walking again through the gardens. We all enjoyed ourselves, had a laugh. A very nice day out.</p>

    <title>Fireworks Night</title>
    <first name="katie">I am 80cm tall</first>
    <info>
		<p>We went to Istead Rise for the Weston firework night. It was littered with the usual array of fireworks, including one Howard brought along which cost £50! They were good, but I cried after the first couple that went up. I'm not sure if I was in the best of moods to watch them as it was quite late for me.</p><p>Later on in the evening Daddy and Michael went off to Gravesend for a couple of jars. First went into Weatherspoons' where a fight was brewing up. One chap took off his jumper, ready for a fight. Everyone in the pub was either a thug or a bit of a slap per!!! Well not quite everyone. But you had to be careful. After a swift pint, we meandered through town seeing some 16 year old, tarted up, being sick in a shop doorway, and shouting obscenities. Daddy had forgotten how entertaining Gravesend was on a Friday night. We then went into the Troc. I think it should be renamed Trogs. Anyway we got back to chez Weston and the party was still on. Daddy didn't get to bed till gone 1 in the end which was a mistake.</p>

    <title>Tottenham V Charlton</title>
    <info>
		<p>I decided that we should have an early start to the day. 6am! It was a bit difficult to do anything for a couple of hours as the house was full of guests. Daddy went out for a walk around the Denton Wharf area. He could have sworn he saw the scaffold fighting man in the pub from last night.</p><p>After breakfast we went off to Shorne Country Park for a nice walk. Mummy beat Daddy by 10 seconds on the adventure trail! I know I surprised as well.</p><p>Mummy, Daddy, Grandpop and Uncle Howard went off to watch Tottenham play Charlton, whilst Grandma and I went for a walk and went swimming with Auntie Ellie in the afternoon.</p><p>The others went to pick up Grandpop's friend from Sidcup who was a staunch Spurs fan. We drove through London to get to the ground, which pleased Daddy (Norman). The tickets were £46 each was a lot of money.</p><p>Anyway, got into the ground and Mummy and Daddy had really missed watching Premiership football. The day before Tottenham had got rid of their manager and they played the first 60 minutes of the game poorly. Charlton weren't much better, just they scored 3 goals from three chances. The Tottenham fans were singing 'you're not fit to wear the shirt'. Substitutions were made and the game turned around. Charlton handballed on the line. 10 men and a penalty against, which was duly scored. Spurs pulled another one back, and the last 15 minutes were tense. However, Charlton hung on and eventually ran out 3-2 winners. An exciting match in the end.</p><p>We then spent the next 3.5 hours travelling back home. Mummy then had a night shift.</p>

    <title>Great Grandma Birthday and Petersham Walk</title>
    <first name="katie">Giving kisses</first>
    <info>
		<p>Normal routine for Sunday morning. Mummy went with Ellie to Grandma's birthday meal at the Star, Leatherhead. Daddy came after football (which they lost 4-1), then Mummy went to catch up on some sleep.</p><p>Daddy and I then drove to Petersham, and we were originally going to go around Ham House, however, we arrived a bit late, so we went for a nice walk instead. We circled Ham House and walked along the Thames. Daddy loved the area. The scenery looking from the banks of the Thames up the hill towards Richmond was brilliant. It was a real Autumns day, very grey, murky and fine rain. Lovely atmosphere. I am still doing this cute thing where I am crouching down (as if I was going to do a plop) and looking around. I also like jumping from the curb into Daddy's arms.</p><p>Mummy again worked another night shift. We all haven't had a decent night’s sleep for 2 weeks!!</p><p>Daddy asked me for a kiss today and turned my head and kissed Daddy on the lips. Daddy felt all proud and warm.</p><p>I am beginning to understand a few things now:-</p><ul><li>Get the ball</li><li>Get the biscuits</li><li>Can I have a kiss</li><li>Duck</li><li>Putting shoes on means going out</li></ul>

    <title>Weymouth and Monkey World</title>
    <info>
		<p>Our first weekend where Laura didn't have a night shift, or have to do Mrs Oddie, or do Crèche at church.</p><p>We decided to go down to Weymouth for the day. We arrived about midday starving, so we had our picnic on the benches by the beach. It was freezing cold and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. The view from the beach was fantastic, looking along the coast to Lullworth. We played on the beach for a while before we needed to find some warmth. Ahh the arcades. We won some money in on the slidey coins machine, then Mummy and Daddy thought it would be a good idea to stick me in a car roundabout ride. I weren't that impressed! We walked around the town centre and the shops in the town. Dad put a bet on and won a 5 way accumulator!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_11_13-12-Weymouth.JPG</src><caption>Amusements in Weymouth</caption></image><p>We then headed back to the car and shifted along to Monkey World near Wareham. We started off by having a nice drink, although I wasn't sure that a slush puppy was a good idea in this weather. We saw lots of chimpanzees, orang-utans and gibbons. We managed to get really close up to them, only the width of the glass away. They were either playing outside, grooming each other or sleeping. You were never too sure at first if they were playing or fighting. It was good to see though.</p><p>In the evening Mummy and Daddy went out for a meal with David and Louise which was very nice. Louise is now 16 weeks pregnant.</p>

There were over 70 donkeys, a number of horses, goats and chickens. It was a private working farm, so it was a bit strange walking around someone else’s property.</p><p>As we were close by, we popped into James and Emma's for a cup of tea. They had their Christmas Tree up already! Couldn't believe it. Anyway it was very Christmassy and we had mince pies as well.</p>

    <title>Auction and Faithless</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy had a busy day. We all went over to Chertsey with Michael as well. Mummy and I went for a walk, looked around the shops and played on the swings near the river.</p><p>Daddy and Michael went to the auctions, but didn't buy anything. They then 'trained' it up to London and met Nick, Martin and Steve to go drinking around Waterloo and to watch Faithless at the Brixton Academy.</p>

    <title>Woburn Safari Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today we drove up to Woburn Safari Park. We got there before it opened, so we went to visit the bison and some deer. The bison were in real muddy conditions.</p><p>We drove around the park, seeing tigers, lions, elephants, giraffes, bears, zebras, rhinos, a hippo, wolves, and last but no means least monkeys. Like at Longleat the monkeys took a fancy to our car. A couple of them climbed on the roof, one of them done a big plop, then decided to tread it in to various parts of the car. Looking forward to seeing mummy clean that one up! Daddy was getting a bit worried because the petrol gauge was on empty, and the warning light was on. However, we managed to get out OK.</p><p>After the driving around we went to stroke the wallabies, played on the outdoor adventure playground, went in the mini-monkey enclosure, saw the sea lion show, played in the soft play area, where daddy went on the vertical drop slide. We also saw the cute penguins (Daddy's favourites), went in the area where you can hold lemurs and went to the elephant ring and actually touched the rough skin of an elephant. Wow wee. We done loads and spent the whole day there.</p><p>In the evening Mummy had to watch her Strictly Come Dancing final. Boring!!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2004/2004_12_11-01-Woburn.jpg</src><caption>Resting at Woburn Safari Park</caption></image>

    <title>London Lights</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy played football down in Alton and lost narrowly by 2-1. It was a really good team effort as they only had 11 players, and played in the right spirit. Mummy and I went to church.</p><p>After Sunday lunch, we drove to Heathrow Airport in hope to tour around the visitors centre. However, it was shut. So Daddy continued up the M4 and drove into the centre of London.</p><p>It was fun looking at all the Christmas lights. Harrods was well lit up. We parked up in Piccadilly, walked up through Piccadilly Circus to the Trocadero. We enjoyed watching all the video games and going up and down the big escalators. It was good fun. We got back to the car and drove up Regents Street to see all the Christmas Lights hanging across the road. Then it was a bit of a mission to get out of London! We stopped off at Makie D's on the way home.</p>

    <info>
		<p>In the evening Daddy went to the Development Christmas Do. However he couldn't eat, because of the previous years experience with the Indian food, and couldn't drink because he had to drive back and look after me, whilst mummy went to work. Anyway it was an enjoyable night where 3 or 4 people were getting drunk whilst the rest of us were stone cold sober. A bit of a surreal experience.</p>

    <title>Our Christmas Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning mummy went to bed after she worked a night. Daddy and I went over to see Oldemor and Daddy and played lots. We then picked up Farmor and went to Chertsey where we walked through the town and stopped in the Ladybird cafe to have a coffee and a doughnut.</p><p>In the afternoon we had to take Mrs Oddie to her son and get ready for the evening's Christmas Party. Auntie Susan also came around for an hour which was nice.</p><p>There were quite a few for this year’s Christmas Party. We played lots of good games including Kelly's finger football game and Michael's flashing pictures quiz. We managed to meet Vicky’s new boyfriend, Paul, and William predictably had oil ridden hands and fell asleep quite early. We finished quite early this year.... In fact just when I was beginning the cocktails!! A good time had by all.</p>

		<p>Opened presents at home first. Went to Fars for breakfast. Whilst Mummy and I went to church Daddy finished opening the rest of his presents.</p><p>We also announced that Mummy was pregnant. Everyone congratulated us and were happy, although I think they may have guessed a little bit, because mummy hasn't been that well recently.</p><p>We went over to Istead Rise for Christmas Lunch, and spent the afternoon opening even more presents! We watched the Vicar Of Dibley Christmas Special which was good and played a pop quiz game.</p>

    <title>New Years Eve - Ellie and Michael's</title>
    <info>
		<p>During the day we chilled. I took baby for a walk around the estate. I particularly like taking her to the top of the fountain bridge and then just letting go, making baby roll down all by herself. In the afternoon Mummy and I had a long sleep for 2.5 hours!</p><p>In the evening we went over to Ellie and Michael's to celebrate the new year in. We had a 'cook yourself' Indian which was scrummy, tried out the chocolate fondue and had some ice cream. We played games and quizzes. Michael and Daddy went out at about 11:15 as we heard, some glass smash. some yobs had smashed 3 car windows and someone’s front door! We spoke to the Police and told them where the boys went. We got in with seconds to spare to sing 'Aulds Langs Syne' and see the fireworks in London.</p><p>I'm getting very clever now. I can say a few words, fish, bee, pooh, duck, mummy, daddy, feet, biscuits (well tries to say that), car, teeth. I understand some words. If mummy or daddy ask me to point to an animal in the book then I can usually get it, or if they ask me to point to body parts like tongue, head, ears, eyes, feet and nose.</p><p>Daddy calls me insatiable, relentless, naughty, sociable, clever and happy.</p>

    <info>
		<p>After Mummy and I went to church we drove up to London and parked along Piccadilly again. Great parking spot. Anyway we walked across Piccadilly Circus, through Leicester Square where there was a fairground. We then ventured into the National Portrait Gallery.</p><p>We weren't too sure what to expect. Daddy saw a picture of Kiera Knightly which made him happy. There were loads of paintings / drawings. The modern era was weird because half of them were just ordinary shots of people. Didn't seem to be special people or photographs. Perhaps we're all philistines when it comes to art!</p><p>Anyway, I was quite happy running up and down the halls, shouting daddy, daddy. We visited all the floors seeing some very old portraits.</p><p>We quickly moved on to Trafalgar Square were we took some snaps and chilled for a bit. Mummy was surprised to see tourists there! Because it is only the centre of the best country of the world (after Denmark of course).</p><p>After the shock of seeing tourists, our mystery tour us to the Thames where we walked along the new Hungerford bridge on the west side, passed the Millennium Wheel, across Westminster bridge, down Whitehall, Across Horse Guards parade and back to the car. I was very cold and upset so we rushed the last bit, but it was nice to get out amongst the busy crowds.</p>

		<p>In the morning we went to an inner city type farm in Morden. It was quite small, but Katie enjoyed it, especially seeing the children going around in horses. Trouble was the weather was atrocious. Cold and very windy. We had to give up in the end because we were worried about Kit Kat, especially as she will not leave a hat and gloves on her for more than a minute.</p><p>In the afternoon Daddy prepared the house and garden for some people who were going to view the house on Sunday. In the evening we watched Supersize Me, which was a bit of an eye opener to fast food.</p>

    <title>Heathrow and Hayes Disasters - Ellie's Baby Shower</title>
    <info>
		<p>We were recommended to go and visit Heathrow Visitor centre. "You can spend all day there". So we thought we'd leave early, pack a picnic, then Daddy go on to football direct. That means we had to drive up separately.</p><p>We got to the Visitor centre and there were about 50 or so plane spotters there. It was a particularly pleasant day. Cold and overcast. We couldn't understand the fascination. Anyway inside the Visitors centre were one or two things to keep Katie amused for about 15 minutes. Then we went to the viewing lounge. All very interesting, again only for 15 minutes. Daddy listened to some very interesting Plane spotter conversations. Plane types, where different planes were, where they've been. We hurried out before sleepiness took over!</p><p>Because we travelled back home, Daddy had to drive all the way back to Hayes to watch Chertsey play. He arrived to see Brook House reserves take on Beaconsfield reserves!!! Dipstick daddy got the wrong venue! To make matters worse Daddy took mummy's purse by accident, stopping her doing the shopping, and he got stuck in a traffic jam on the way home!!</p><p>In the evening we took Great Grandma over to Alton, as we all went over to celebrate the coming of the Elder baby. At last I'll get a little cousin soon. Mummy is obsessed at finding what names have been chosen for little Wayney. She goes on and on.</p><p>I settled down for bed, whilst the other party guests arrived. The girls played lots of games and swapped birth stories, whilst the men folk went down the pub to play darts and pool. We stayed over the night which was very nice.</p>

    <info>
		<p>We left early from Ellie and Michael's, and went back home to play then go to church. Daddy had football in the afternoon, whilst we went food shopping. Later in the afternoon we went over to Alton again and spent the evening with the Elders. The boys went off to the Pyramids in Portsmouth to see a band called Athlete. They were very good. Daddy said he wants to change his hair style to something more grungy (longer, messed up look!)</p>

    <title>Cambridge</title>
    <info>
		<p>We decided to go to Cambridge for the day. It was a long journey and stopped off at Wimpole Hole Farm. I got very scared of seeing the piggies being fed. I was physically shaking. The pigs were squealing so loud. Daddy was very brave in feeding the goats. We're all scaredy cats really. Daddy was afraid they would bite him, or eat his fingers.</p><p>We made it to Cambridge. It got a bit stressy at lunchtime, because I was crying the shops down. We eventually made it to the park area and had a picnic, but it was bitterly cold. We gazed around the market and looked for a hat and scarf for me.</p><p>Mummy and Daddy gave up with me in the end. I just wasn't happy. So we made it home just in time for dinner.</p>

    <title>BubBobs Scan - 18 months Old</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today I am 18 months old. Happy Birthday And A Half to me!! This means a complete change of wardrobe. Don't ask! Mummy takes baby clothes sizes absolutely literally. The day I am 18 months, means I start wearing 18-24 month sized clothes. All the 12-18 months now go in the loft!</p><p>In the afternoon we all went down to Frimley Park Hospital to see if the baby inside mummy's tummy was alright. Everything is fit and healthy. The crown-rump length was at around the 75th percentile mark. We got a couple of pictures.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_01_24-01-BabyNo2.jpg</src><caption>Bubbop 1st picture</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_01_24-02-BabyNo2.jpg</src><caption>Bubbop 1st picture</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_01_24-02-KatieDrawing.jpg</src><caption>Katie drawing all by herself</caption></image>

    <title>Fars to send me to bed</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy went off to do some market research at Tesco. This gave an opportunity for the Fars to come over and get me ready for bed. We played a bit first then they gave me a bath. I think it was the first time they have seen me in the bath. They then got me dressed for bed, and they tried to give me a bottle, but I wanted Daddy to give that to me. They done very well, and I got to bed on time. Daddy was also able to be strict with me, when going to bed. Instead of sleeping with me until I fall asleep in mummy and daddy's bed, he gave me 10 minutes, then put me in my cot. I cried for a bit, but then settled down quite quickly.</p>

It was big, with a huge wingspan.</p><p>In the afternoon, daddy tried to fix the washing machine. It's got a leak. He wasn't very successful. He flooded half the kitchen and managed to drop the machine on his feet, making them bleed. Ouch!!</p><p>In the evening Daddy went to Ascot by bike and train, for David's emigration farewell. It was nice to meet up with Stuart and James again. I wonder if Daddy will ever see them again. Anyway Daddy had a good night out.</p>

		<p>In the morning mummy and I went with Lorraine and Joshua to a sale at the Catholic church. Daddy on the other hand was helping shift some dishwashers from David's 3rd floor flat. Nice! It was strange to see the flat all empty. David had been there since 1978! He was emigrating to Oz.</p><p>Ellie, Michael and Joseph came around for a greasy lunch and spent the early part of the afternoon around, chatting and mucking about. It was Daddy's first proper cuddle with Joseph. He sleeps during the day and is awake at night. He looks a lot like Uncle Michael.</p><p>In the evening Daddy sorted out the new DVD recorder.</p>

    <title>David Emigrates, Fencing, Weston's Home From NZ</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy got up at 5:45am to take David finally to Heathrow. Today he was emigrating to Australia. Louise went a couple of weeks ago and has found a house, and has setup things.</p><p>Daddy tried to make sure they had a laugh on the way to the airport, to avoid any thought, or emotions. They checked in and waited for James and Joshy. They came and they all sat in the coffee shop and had a laugh for an hour or so. Finally it was time to see David go through the departures gate. I wonder if we'll see him again? I hope so. We defiantly would love to go to Australia. The only problem is having young kids and the expense. I'd want to make sure if we are spending loads of money, that the kids will be old enough to remember the trip.</p><p>Afterwards Daddy wet over to the Fars to help with replacing one of the sides of the gardens fences. It was bitterly cold. Zero degrees (as snow was falling at some points).</p><p>On the other hand me, mummy, and the Elders went to Heathrow to welcome back the Weston trip to New Zealand. They had a great time out there.</p><p>We also took Mrs Oddie to see her son in the afternoon.</p><p>In the evening mummy and daddy watched Maverick, which was a nice, easy film to watch.</p>

    <title>Syon Park and Dawgs 30th</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had a busy day today. In the morning mummy went off to an NCT sale and bought me a Dyson and cleaning trolley! I absolutely loved them. Daddy and I on the other hand went off first to the library to pick some new books up, then off to collect Farmor’s mother’s day present from the sorting office. We popped into see Farfar on the way home.</p><p>After lunch we drove up to Syon Park in Brentford. We went to the butterfly house which was amazing at first when the butterflies didn't come close. There were so many, and they weren't afraid of us. Daddy picked a few of them up. Some were very colourful, whilst others were difficult to see as they were camouflaged. There was also a small aviary and some fish. The leaf cutting ants were amazing. Watching them go along with bits of leaf on their back. All was not well, when they came fluttering towards me. I only last 10 minutes at a time before I cried too much. I think I have the same phobia as mummy.</p><p>We spent about an hour in their in total. Next door was an aquatic centre. It was brilliant in there as well. We saw giant tortoises, monkeys, big fish, and there was a man showing off all the animals in the cages to the children there. He got out a millipede, a scorpion and finally a big boa constrictor snake. Of course I was too scared to touch them myself. However, I did have a good wander around and almost inadvertently touched the snake as the man was presenting! In both places we visited the climate was very warm and humid. Daddy went onto one of the chairs and tried to have a snooze for 20 minutes. It was so nice to hear all the different animals. It sounded like a jungle.</p><p>Soon after we returned home, Grandma, Grandpop and Uncle John Garratt came around to see me. They showed off their recent New Zealand photos off.</p><p>Today was cousin Steven's 30th birthday. Mummy and Daddy went down to the Quays to celebrate it with him and the Barnett family, whilst Auntie Susan came around to baby sit me. He got lots of presents. They had a meal and a nice time.</p>

    <title>Barn Dance and Stevens 30th in Reading</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning mummy went off again to another toddlers sale, this time with Lorraine. Daddy and I first went to do the recycling together. This took us ages, but after 40 minutes we ventured into Sainsbury’s to get some fruit for super juicing. As a treat for being a good girl daddy then took me over to Frimley Lodge park and played on the adventure playground. Off course 'bubby' came along to. It was pretty cold, and we went home to meet up with Mummy and have some lunch.</p><p>After my sleep, mummy and I went to Gravesend to go to the Barn Dance which was organised by Grandma in aid for the Anthony Nolan Trust. I absolutely loved it there. Dancing until gone 9 o'clock.</p><p>Daddy on the other hand went out to celebrate Steve's second 30th party. One for his friends this time. It was held in Reading and it was good to see some old faces again. There was Daddy, Barrie, Michael, Martin, Phil Rowe and Anna, Martin Bigg, Steve Laidlaw and his girlfriend, Chris Lomas, and of course Steve and Joyce.</p>

		<p>Some of my big teeth are starting to come through now which has meant I've been grotty for the past day or so. The weather had turned a couple of weeks ago from snow and prolonged freezing temperatures to 20 degree sunshine, shorts and t-shirt weather.</p><p>I'm getting into the habit of waking between 5:30 and 6am in the morning at the moment! Mummy insists on her way of parenting, and daddy wants to do it differently! Mummy wins out at the moment. She'd da boss.</p><p>We were heading for the beaches of Bournemouth, stopping in at the Queen Mary collage to book up Katie's swimming lessons. However, we think due to teething, I was not having a good time of it. Then mummy came up with the idea of going to Marwell Zoo. Surprisingly Katie seemed to understand that we were going to a zoo and cheered up no end.</p><p>We got in and first headed towards to penguins, the giraffes and various other animals. After lunch we saw zebras and tigers which I loved. "Hi Ya", "Hi Ya".. Hor Horrr. There were loads of animals, and it was good to see them actually move around, and see them close up as well.</p><p>We managed to get to the far end of the park. We had done a lot of walking and it was getting quite warm, so we had ice creams. I had a Callipo which I dropped on the floor. That was it. I was so upset and distressed, coupled with my tiredness, I was inconsolable. We had to head out of the park.</p><p>As Alton was kind on our way home, we decided to pop in and see the Elders on the way home. We stole a cup of tea from them, said hello to Joseph, before getting home for tea and bath time. It was a long, and very enjoyable day.</p>

    <info>
		<p>In the morning Daddy played in a good game of football against top place, Bentley and drew 2-2. Mummy and I went to church.</p><p>In the afternoon we took Mrs Oddie out. We felt so sorry for her, especially when Mummy had to say that we were giving up taking her. She had sellotaped her sandals, where they had broken. Poor lady.</p><p>We walked over to the park and played there for a while. I was going down the slide head first! I'm such a brave girl.</p><p>We went around to Karen and Richards for a Sunday meal. It was lovely.</p>

    <title>What a Cracking Key</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy's car key is on the verge of cracking in two. In fact we've had a lot of hassle this week over the key. We've spoken to Toyota and they say it'll cost £300 to fix! Daddy sought alternatives even going to a welder at 6am to see if we could do a cut n'shut job on it. No luck. The key is stuck in the ignition at the moment!</p><p>Anyway once the key and ignition barrel have been replaced we are going to sell the car. The idea is to get Mummy and new 5 door car so that it is easier for the family to get around. It'll be tough to get 2 kids in a three door car. Anyway in the morning we decided to clean the Corolla together. Katie was more interested in scrubbing the road and fence than the car. But it must of been heaven for her, helping mummy and daddy doing the cleaning!!</p><p>In the afternoon Daddy and I went around to the Fars by bike, cutting through the woods. It was the first time this year that I went on the bike and I loved it. Daddy was bit worried if I was or not. I definitely don't like having the helmet on my head. I think I spent most of the time trying to get it off!</p><p>Later on in the afternoon we had a meal. Auntie Susan and Graham turned up to. It was a Danish meatloaf meal. Very nice.</p><p>We found out that Mat and Melinda are pregnant with their first. due date is sometime in October.</p>

    <title>Easter Egg Hunt</title>
    <info>
		<p>We were having the Weston's over for a spot of Easter lunch. We frantically got everything ready, including setting up a Easter Egg hunt in the back garden. 44 eggs to hide in a sparse garden!</p><p>It was a lovely lunch. Strangely enough I managed to find most of the eggs in the back garden! Later on we moved on to the Great Grandparents house to meet with the rest of the Barnett family. It was lovely afternoon. Daddy took me to the swings behind Great Grandma's house.</p>

    <title>Natural History Museum</title>
    <info>
		<p>We done the Monday food shop in the morning. It was nice a quiet in Asda.</p><p>Daddy drove up to Turnham Green where we caught the tube to Kensington High Street and proceeded to walk to Hyde Park. We fed the ducks and had some lunch ourselves, before trotting over to the Natural History Museum. Because it was a bank holiday it was packed inside. The queue for the Dinosaur section was too long for us to queue for. Daddy felt the exhibits were a bit out dated now. Katie kind of enjoyed it, seeing all the animals, even though they were stuffed or sprawled on display.</p><p>We walked across to South Kensington tube and had an Ice Cream. I just love my Callipo's. Belisimo!</p><p>We caught a very crowded bus to Green Park. Walked through to St James's park and watched the wildlife, and played in the playground for a bit. I enjoyed the slide and swing. I even played in the massive sea of sand. Before now I've always been a bit wary of sand.</p><p>We had done quite a bit of walking today...... We walked back up through Pall Mall and caught a bus back to Hammersmith, where we got the tube back to the car and then home.</p><p>Running a bit late, Farfar came around for dinner, as Farmor had left yesterday for Copenhagen. A long day.</p>

    <title>Dapdune Wharf, Chertsey and Reading</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was a nice weekend's worth of weather. In the morning we quickly went over to see Farfar for a cup of tea and to pick up the National Trust tickets.</p><p>We went to Jacobs Well first to play at a really good swing park, before moving on to a National Trust place in Guildford called Dapdune Wharf. It was quite a small site. We went on a lovely boat trip up and down the Wey Navigation to the centre of Guildford and back again. It was so relaxing and peaceful and Katie loved looking out.</p><p>After wandering around the mini Island, we went home for lunch and a sleep.</p><p>Later in the afternoon we went over to Chertsey to watch them play Kingsbury. We won 2-0. Both teams were reduced to 10 men. It was nice to see a lot of old faces down there. Carol, Mervyn, Clive and Pat in particular.</p><p>After dinner Daddy went out with Martin and Nick to Reading for a bit of pub crawl. They had a bit of a games evening. Playing pinball, pool and table football.</p>

		<p>Had church in the morning. After a delicious Sunday lunch we headed over to Alton and met up with the Elders. We walked over to the Watercress line where we saw a train with a Thomas face on it. Not sure which of the steam trains out of Thomas The Tank Engine it was supposed to be. Anyway Katie enjoyed it. We walked back, getting a messy chocolate ice cream on the way</p><p>We headed over to Martin's for the grand releasing of his fish into his new pond. There was a nice BBQ and we met up with Martin's mother, sister, her boyfriend, Barrie and Laura and a few of his neighbours.</p>

    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went a different way to get to IKEA, Wembley! We were looking for ideas and bits for Katie's new room. Our new arrival will have Katie's current room. We were thinking of decorating it in a jungle theme seeing Katie loves animals. However, our trip was unsuccessful. Coming out with just a plant, and a hot dog each! I loved playing on all of the furniture and the IKEA slide.</p><p>After our sleep, the Elders came over. They got a really rubbish film out for us to watch, which we gave up on. They stayed over the night.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Today we split into two camps. The girls went to church and then on to a nice zoo in Hounslow before trekking back down to Alton.</p><p>The boys on the other hand met up with Nick and Martin and went off to the Superbikes at Thruxton. It was a great day out. We stood by the 'complex'. a series of S bends. We saw a number of off's including a double off, where one rider was none too pleased and started to punch the other rider whilst they had their helmets on. The stupidest thing you'll likely to see.</p><p>We also managed to see a pastie get smashed up, for other reasons!</p>

I say "Bye Bye Daddy" when daddy goes off to work now as well.</p><p>My favourite toy at the moment is the wooden farm set. I get mummy or daddy to get bread so I can feed it to the wooden ducks!</p><p>I love to play at the swing park and going to farms.</p>

    <title>Scenic Walk - Yer Right and Littlehampton</title>
    <info>
		<p>This walk is straight out of Mummy's top organisational, planned mornings.</p><p>Daddy drove us over to Carshalton. Even though Mummy had supposedly look up the place where we were going to, she hadn't so we didn't know exactly where we were going. Anyway we eventually found 'The Oak Park', Carshalton. We started walking, but of course Mummy needed the toilet straight away. So we headed towards the cafe first. We now started properly. A lovely park. However, we didn't see much of it as Mummy was convinced that the walk was to take out of the park. So we clambered over the style gate into a farmer’s field. We had to pick Katie up, because where there weren't brambles and stinging nettles, there were deep ruts, nice for you to turn your ankle in! We reached the top of the hill and the views were amazing. The farmer had laid out all this polythene sheeting on his crop of something, I assume to protect it from the local wildlife. On the horizon Highdown and Downview prison could be seen.</p><p>No matter, we could see some horses in the next field, so we quickly trotted over to see them. They were enclosed, so we could go close enough to give them a stroke. They were like shire horses. Anyway we decided to get a photo as Katie loved photo's. As Mummy took the photo, daddy step back on to the fence. It was an electric fence!!! Arrgghh. So we have a face of Daddy just when he's being electrocuted. Certainly got the heart racing.</p><p>Out of the field we went onto a main road, with no paths, just fast vehicles! Great conditions for a 21 month year old.</p><p>We dived into the next field and Mummy made us walk up this hill. Daddy insisted there would be a dead end at the top. Mummy of course doesn't listen to Daddy's expert advice. Of course Daddy was right and 15 minutes later we waded through the long, wet grass back to where we were. The only direction open us was east. However, this was going towards a mobile home park. As we got closer there were kids playing football, with Irish accents. It was like a scene out of Snatch! Anyhow we curbed the foul mouthed boys, covering up Katie's ears and made our way around the back of the estate hoping to reach the main road again.</p><p>All of a sudden a pit or bull (or related) came scarpering from the camp, that was it. Mummy too scared to carry on down the path, so we had to go back again this time making our way through the mobile village. We were immediately accosted by some Irish, gyppo kids. "Who are you?". Nice. Anyway we hurriedly walked through the camp, back to the main road, then another 20 minute walk back to the park and the car! What a disastrous scenic, relaxing walk.</p><p>We drove across to Purley hoping to catch Fi and Kelly. However, we couldn't get hold of them, so sat in Tesco car park, eating a nice lunch that Daddy got us.</p><p>We then decided to go down the M23 to the coast. Brighton was the first idea, then Worthing, but finally we settled at stopping at Littlehampton.</p><p>We walked by the mouth of the River Arun. There was a small scaled fun fair there. I wouldn't go on the car roundabout ride, finally settling on a 10 minute go on the trampoline. I loved it. Had a great time on there.</p><p>We had an ice cream on the beach and walked down to touch the sea, then back again. We walked swiftly back to the car, then back home.</p>

		<p>In the morning mummy, myself, Ellie and Joseph went to church, whilst Daddy went to play football over at the polo fields. Uncle Michael almost got into a fight at the football after he fouled someone.</p><p>In the afternoon we met up with the Fars and Auntie Susan at Tri Lakes and walked around looking at the farm animals, which was good. The slides that were there were more interesting than the animals. I think I am a slide-aholic!</p><p>Later in the afternoon we went to Frimley Lodge Park and met up with the Barnett's for a quick half an hour.</p><p>Grandma took back the Micra as Auntie Charlotte is back next couple weeks.</p><p>Daddy spoke to Claire on the phone for the first time for probably about a year. It was good to catch up again.</p>

		<p>We said goodbye to 'Ma Ma' and 'Pop Pop' in the morning.</p><p>In the afternoon we went over to the Elders. Me and the boys went down to the local swimming pool. I impressed Daddy on how independent I was in the swimming pool. With my arm bands on I could kick my way back to the steps. Also I didn't need to be help continually. I think I must have drank half of the pool though. Both Daddy and I stayed in there for over an hour which is a record.</p><p>Mummy and 'Auntie Ear', went to an NCT sale and got some goodies.</p><p>We played round a bit at Ellie and Michael's, had some din dins, bath, the normal routine.... then Mummy and Daddy beat the Elders at Triv! :) We returned home after a nice day late that night.</p>

Easier said than done to begin with!</li><li>Eventually moved on to actually riding the bike in first gear, for 10 yards.</li><li>Then turning around cones</li><li>Usage of gears. 1st, 2nd, 3rd and back down again</li><li>Finally ended with some clutch control.</li></ul><p>Very good. Daddy has signed up to take up a full course of lessons. Gulp.</p><p>Mummy and I in the meantime were taking Mrs Oddie.</p><p>Later in the afternoon, Daddy and I went over to see the Fars. We went for a walk to the pond and back. We chatted to Dave and Rita, next door, Barrie's dad, and finally with Stuart Climpson's parents. It was the first time I spoke to them probably since I was 15 or 16. Stuart has got a little girl, only a month old.</p><p>Mummy had a night shift later on. :(</p>

    <title>Notcuts, Orienteering, Thames Bike Ride</title>
    <first name="katie">World Cup Event</first>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went over to Notcuts as they were opening their new pet centre. To help promote they got some birds of prey in and some bugs. On the way in Dawn French walked behind us. I think she went straight to the restaurant through an officials door.</p><p>Anyway I managed to touch a snake, a python!! It was felt like leather. In the new pet centre there was a photographer who took some pictures of us. We thought we might be in the paper.</p><p>On the way home, into Dettingen Park, we saw signs for 'World Cup Event'. Intrigued, we went and had a look to see what it was. In the army field, there was an international line-up of orienteer’s! The Danes of course were the best. :)</p><p>After lunch we went to Laleham and had a really nice cycle ride along the Thames to the other side of Staines. It was really sunny, and the houses looked lovely along there. Mummy and I played on the swings whilst Daddy cycled back to get the car.</p>

    <title>EastEnders and TGI Fridays</title>
    <first name="katie">Got a temperature</first>
    <info>
		<p>Our mission today was to do a bit of a reccy for Daddy's 30th birthday outing with the boys. The plan is to go to Shoreditch and surrounding area for the day.</p><p>We caught the tube from Turnham Green and eventually got to Shoreditch and walked around, taking some snaps of local watering holes. We stopped off for a bite to eat, before travelling south of the river to Greenwich, visiting our traditional 'pie and mash' shop and having a gander in the market.</p><p>However, I really wasn't on form today. I was extremely quiet, tired and irritable. Mummy and Daddy were worried about me. So we ended by catching a Docklands Light Railway back to the city and got home as quick as possible.</p><p>In the evening Ellie and Michael came over to baby sit, whilst Mummy and Daddy went with Helen, Nigel, Fi and Kelly to TGI Fridays in Guildford. Fi told us that she and Kelly are expecting a baby Christmas Time, which is great news. Hopefully another potential friend for Katie and Jesper!! Daddy also was getting put off taking up motorcycling from Nigel and Kelly. The stories they were coming out with worried Daddy a bit.</p>

    <title>Torbay Holiday - Setting Off</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy decided to take the scenic route down to Paignton, going down via the A31!! We stopped off at Bridport to get some lunch and took it with us down to Seatown, a small beach, dwarfed by the Golden Cap on the west side, and equally impressive inclines to the east.</p><p>We walked past the moo's to the tip of the first hill, then the second, then the third, Thorncombe Beacon. We planned to have our picnic there, but because of all the dung, there were so many flies we couldn't sit and eat. For some reason we took the pushchair with us, just for that extra test. Mummy done ever so well considering she is 7 months pregnant! By the time we got back to the beach we were sweating buckets.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_05_16-ThorncombeBeacon.JPG</src><caption>On top of Thorncombe Beacon, Seatown</caption></image><p>We had our picnic on the beach, touched the water and played at the river/lake. Trying to hit the Fosters can.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_05_16-SeatownBeach.JPG</src><caption>Modelling on Seatown Beach</caption></image><p>Daddy drove as we had a sleep. He still decided to take the scenic route, and went via Sidmouth, which was full of old biddies, on our way to Exeter and finally to Paignton.</p><p>We arrived mid afternoon by Linda, who showed us around our cottage. It was a lovely maisonette within the main house grounds. Just right for us.</p><p>We popped out for some shopping and went to Torquay and walked along the quay.</p>

Fascinated by them all. I think I could have watched the lion, tiger and gorillas all day long.

    <title>Dartmoor, Lydford Gorge (NT), Drogo Castle (NT)</title>
    <first name="katie">Stung by stinging nettle</first>
    <info>
		<p>We headed west, through the horrendous morning traffic of Totnes towards Dartmoor. We climbed and meandered through the villages of Buckfast, Holne and Two Bridges. We stopped a few times to look at the panoramic views, Dartmoor horses and sheep. One horse turned her back to us and wiggled her bum across the gate. We drove the breadth of Dartmoor, across towards Tavistock.</p><p>After two hours we arrived at Lydford Gorge. The NT woman looked a little surprised that we were going to take Katie with us as there were supposedly steep, narrow pathways. We plodded on the 3 mile walk. Katie was in step heaven. Steps up, step down. On the way to the waterfall we were quite high up the gorge. We couldn't see the rapids for all the trees and foliage. We eventually clambered down to see the waterfall which was quite high, but not a great deal of water. The trek back was dangerous in parts and ran along the rapids. There weren't many guard rails, so I was carried a lot of the way. The rapids and scenery were superb. We loved it. It was capped off with Devils Cauldron, which almost like a cave with a waterfall and a lagoon running down to the next set of rapids and lagoon. It was quite spectacular.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_05_18-LydfordGorge.JPG</src><caption>How much have I enjoyed today?</caption></image><p>After 3 hours of walking we finished the walk. We stopped off for a spot of lunch and a cup of tea.</p><p>We drove to Castle Drogo, which was back in Dartmoor again. A bit of a weird place. The last castle to be built in England in 1910-1930. I still didn't quite understand the need for a castle in the middle of nowhere at a time when castles were outdated by 100's of years. We walked around and it was more like a stately home. We spent an hour or so there before returning back to the cottage.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_05_18-KatiePinkBench.JPG</src><caption>How much have I enjoyed today?</caption></image><p>Here is a list of things I say which make mummy and daddy laugh.</p><ul><li>Wee Bomp Lide (Slide, then wee-bomp is the noise of going down and then landing)</li><li>'ello boyz</li><li>Woosies (sweets)</li><li>animols (animals)</li><li>Booey (balls or boulders)</li><li>hooray, hooray (start of the song hooray-hooray, holi-holiday</li><li>Naughty Daddy</li><li>Sorry (even when I haven't done something wrong.

    <title>Paignton to Dartmouth Steam Train and Blackpool Sands</title>
    <first name="katie">My first sand castle</first>
    <info>
		<p>We looked around Paignton before catching the 7 mile, steam train trip along the coast to Kingswear. We got a face full of soot when we stuck our head out of the window! We arrived and queued for the passenger ferry across the Dart to Dartmouth. We wandered around the town, sat and had our lunch on a bench by the river side, then caught a river and harbour cruise which lasted an hour. The highlight was seeing the Castle guarding the mouth of the river. It looked pretty dramatic. Dartmouth had a Mediterranean feel with multicoloured, old, houses terraced along the hill, with narrow streets and just local shops. A Refreshing change.</p><p>We got the train back to Paignton, entertaining a few grannies on the way.</p><p>We jumped in the car, driving back to Dartmouth, kind of killing a pigeon on the way. He flew into the side of the car. I just saw him in my mirrors desperately trying to get out of the busy road. Poor old thing. We left him, assuming he'd be soon run over. The car ferry across the Dart from Kingswear was very basic, a pontoon that was pushed along by a tug. By now the weather was poor. Windy and rainy. We persevered, and surprise, surprise we were the only ones on the beach. Katie made her first sand castle. Daddy got his feet, shoes and socks wet when he tried to clean the bucket in the sea! We didn't stay long and returned home via a fish and chip shop, and flaked out reasonably early again.</p>

    <info>
		<p>We dropped off the keys to Linda and Mike who were very hospitable and drove along the coast into Torquay stopping at the marina and at Meadfoot Beach.</p><p>Proceeding home, we stopped off at the National Trust's, Stourton Gardens and House and walked around the big lake. It was very picturesque, with plenty of colours and smells in the plants and trees. However, I was getting tired and we left for home, via the supermarket to get the weekly food shop.</p><p>Overall we had a great holiday. It was so nice to spend some time together as a family without any distractions. We all had plenty of fun and lots of laughs (usually at my expense!!)</p>

		<p>The weather wasn't great today so restricted Mummy and I to only go for some short walks.</p><p>Daddy on the other hand was on a 6 hour motorbike training course. In the morning there were showers and blustery conditions so it was quite interesting out on the roads. In the afternoon he progressed onto the 500cc bike which was cool, although didn't go too fast as he was with a girl who was struggling a bit on a 125cc.</p><p>Mummy worked a night.</p>

    <title>Motorbike Test Passed and Oldemor's condition</title>
    <info>
		<p>£550 later, Daddy passed his motorbike exam first time - As all good riders do apparently!! The test went OK. The examiner seemed to think I had problems going around corners, taking them like an HGV truck would. i.e. swinging out in the wrong direction to give as much space as possible to make the turn. He said he almost failed me for it, but didn't consider it to be bad enough in the end.</p><p>Next step is to find a bike, get the helmet, leathers and boots. Sell the white Corolla and away we go!</p><p>In the evening the Fars rang up from Denmark to say that they have had a meeting with a doctor, an occupational health and physiotherapist and the outlook doesn't look to hopefully for Oldemor. It would seem she is not making very quick progress with her leg and it would seem she will not be able to walk or stand without a lot of help. It would seem that her days at Kaerholmen have passed, and she will need to go into a home. On the up side she seems happy enough in hospital, if a little tired and confused sometimes. Daddy hopes to go out to Denmark in a few weeks time to see how she is.</p>

After we went to get some of my bedroom bed covers and curtains.</p><p>In the afternoon we wanted to go to a farm. However, one was shut, the other not open to the public, so we ended up playing in Farnham Park for quite a while. There was a wicked slide there.</p><p>We quickly dashed over to see Steven and Joyce and congratulate them on their engagement.</p>

    <title>Motorbike Gear, Swimming</title>
    <info>
		<p>Whilst mummy and I went to church, Daddy went out with Uncle Howard and Farfar to get a helmet, jacket, trousers and boots for the bike. Fully kitted up in red and black. Dented the wallet by another £500! Still at last daddy is in a position to get a bike now.</p><p>All the boys came around for a cup of tea. After a late lunch, we went swimming. Daddy lets me free a lot more than mummy. Mummy couldn't watch, so she went to do 16 lengths!! We were very impressed. I impressed Daddy with my kick, kick, kick. I can kick to the side of the pool now.</p><p>We popped over to Auntie Susan afterwards, then came home. I was grizzlely because I hadn't had a good night's sleep or an afternoon nap.</p><p>Charlotte came over after I went to bed to pick her car up.</p>

    <title>Thames Bike Ride, Fars, Haircut</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today we cycled from Chertsey to Sunbury lock along the Thames. It was a lovely ride which included getting the expensive ferry across the river at Shepperton (for £5!). There were plenty of rowers out and I loved noseying into other people’s business and seeing the world go past on the bike. Mummy done ever so well considering how pregnant she is. Dad rode back to get the car. Certainly a ride to continue next time.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_06_11-ThamesRide.jpg</src><caption>Thames Ride</caption></image><p>After lunch Mummy went for her facial in Camberley, whilst Daddy and I went over to play at the Fars. Again we camped out in the back garden, had some food and went looking for my favourite.... SPIDERS. We didn't actually find any this time.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_06_11-AtDaFars.jpg</src><caption>Thames Ride</caption></image><p>I went for my, now traditional bowl haircut later in the afternoon.

    <title>Thames Ride Part III, Bought Motorbike</title>
    <info>
		<p>Wow, what a hot day. 32 degrees centigrade. We set out in the morning for the next bit of our Thames ride from Sunbury Lock. It was a glorious day, all manner of boats on the river, couples promenading, fisherman camped out and us! All Daddy heard for the first half of the trip was "picnic", "picnic". Straight out of mummy's mould. Anything that I saw and could say the word, I said: "Lots of boats", "Lovely house", "byke"....</p><p>We stopped off just passed Hampton Court Palace for a nice picnic and to wave at some boats. Another pasting of sun cream and we were off again heading eastwards. We made it to Kingston where we popped in and saw James in Clarkes. He said business was down today because it is so hot. He gave us a nice cool, bottle of water before we carried on. "Annie Van, Annie Van" was the cry into Daddy's other van. An "Annie" is an Ice Cream.</p><p>We finally stopped at Teddington Lock for an "Annie" and Daddy turned around to cycle all the way back again to where we'd dropped the car off. I think we were by the river for 5 hours or so, and the heat had tired me out.</p><p>Daddy and Uncle Howard went over to Chalfont St Giles to look at a motorbike. It was in good nick and they decided to put a deposit down. It is a red, CB500S, T Reg, 22,500 miles.</p><p>When they got back they had a nice BBQ to cap off a busy day.</p>

    <title>Daddy and Farmor to visit Oldemor</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy was still out in Denmark visiting Oldemor in her new, but temporary old people’s home in Husum (Copenhagen). There were some happy and sad moments. Farmor had remarked how spritely and how much more 'with it', Oldemor seemed to be, recalling a story when Farmor had picked up dog muck from her playschool days. We also managed to get her to laugh, and she herself showing her dry sense of humour, teasing Farmor.</p><p>There were bits that Daddy found hard to take. When they arrived at the home there was a communal brunch. The woman opposite, looked and behaved half dead, eyes shut, opening a tiny fraction infrequently and not responding to Farmor's hello's. There was another lady shouting and complaining about the service, whilst another was shouting to go back home and wanting her mother. It was desperately sad, and to think Oldemor went off to the zoo just a couple of months ago, and now to be classified with these others.</p><p>Oldemor's room is a bit sparse, so Farmor and Daddy put some pictures on the wall, brought some ornaments and of course some flowers to brighten the place up. She has a little hall way, with a wardrobe, a toilet and her room has a window facing some other flats, a TV that she can't operate and an electronic bed. The room could do with some carpet, as it sounds very hollow. Still it is temporary and we can only hope she gets somewhere nicer soon.</p><p>Farmor had to leave early on Sunday, so Daddy went over to visit and this time managed to take Oldemor out to Mossel Lake where they had 'cafe og wienerbrød'. It was so nice to see her out and breathing some fresh air, seeing children and others jogging or cycling again. However, on the last day Daddy was there she was getting so much better, that she was confused why she was there. She couldn't understand that she lived there and not at Kaerholmen. Daddy was frequently asked where she lived, and what time are we going back. It was so sad.</p><p>Her short term memory is bad at times, but otherwise you could have a normal conversation with her. On the Saturday she may have forgotten that she couldn't walk and tried to get out of the wheelchair and fell to the floor. I just wouldn't like to think how long it took the staff to notice she was on the floor. Many tears were shed. Only after you have been to see her can Daddy appreciate how different Mormor is. Only to think 2 months ago, she had her independence</p><p>Still Farmor is going to get back out there again in 2 weeks time. I hope we can go and see her as soon as my brother or sister is allowed to fly. By then she'll hopefully be in more permanent and nicer surroundings.</p>

It wasn't, so we made our way to Uncle Martin's BBQ. We had some nice food, but later left for Alton to go to bed.</p><p>It was left to the boys (Daddy, Michael, Martin, Nick, Steve, Icey) to play 2 games of poker which Daddy both won. Daddy caught a lift with Nick and slept over at the Fars.</p>

    <title>30th Birthday - Lundums Meal</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today was a family celebration of Daddy's 30th birthday. We drove to South Kensington after church and me up with the rest of the immediate family.</p><p>For some of us younger members it was the poshest restaurant we had been to. Our starters were various pickled herrings, with a boiled egg, topped with caviar! Of course Mummy didn't have any of it, but Daddy absolutely loved it. Daddy and Charlotte had a traditional schnapps to wash this down. Then began the civilized scrum to the buffet section. There was salmon in various guises, halibut, breaded plaice, roast pork, roast beef, frikadeller, dried sausage, ham and salads.</p><p>Most of us went up for a couple plates worth. We also had a nice pudding. We hope everyone enjoyed themselves. It was nice that the families intermingled.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_07_03-02-MartinLauraDenTops.JPG</src><caption>Mummy and Daddy Are Vikings</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_07_03-33-LundumsMeal.JPG</src><caption>Mummy and I at Lundums</caption></image>

    <title>30th Birthday - BBQ</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy had a busy week at work, so it was nice for him to go out to the Bee in Windlesham with the Fars. He got a Denmark football training top which was really nice. Unknown to daddy the meeting was contrived. As Daddy was at the pub, we were preparing a surprise BBQ with his friends. Daddy got a shock when he came through the garden gate to see Barrie, Laura, Ellie, Michael, Joseph, Karen, Richard, Martin and Steven waiting for him. Unfortunately it was too late for me. Anyway the BBQ went well, and the evening ended with a race night, which Mummy won.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_07_08-SlopSuprise.jpg</src><caption>Surprise!!</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_07_08-KatieJoey.jpg</src><caption>Cousin Joey</caption></image>

    <title>30th Birthday - London</title>
    <info>
		<p>Still a surprise, Daddy drove on the M25 dangerously close to Istead Rise. I know, it's going to be a weekend with the in-laws!!! No, well yes for me. At last a rest from the parents, and out with the grandparents who give me loads of treats. We went off to the zoo and played loads.</p><p>Meanwhile mummy and daddy went to Blackheath and strolled through the park and around the market, before taking a river cruise up the Thames to Westminster, weaving past an old traditional boat race on the way. From Westminster they caught a bus to Hempstead Heath and walked to the top of the hill with views all over London. The weather by now was heating up.</p><p>The next part of the surprise was still to come. We took the 'scenic route' to Kensington where Mummy had booked a 5 star hotel, called The Rembrandt, just opposite the Victoria and Albert museum. It was a lovely hotel, although Mummy wasn't impressed by the upgraded, executive room.</p><p>After a little rest, the party moved on to the West End. Due to the bombings earlier in the week and a fire that closed the road in Piccadilly we saw quite a lot of Hyde Park Corner, a place where Mummy doesn't ever want to go back to. Only 10 minutes late for the St Martin's theatre performance of the Mousetrap. It was really good and quaint to be back in the theatre again. Daddy really does enjoy plays so much more than musicals.</p><p>The night ended with a stroll around late night London and a pizza from a restaurant in Leicester Square. A very enjoyable day.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_07_10-04-BirthdayChartwell.JPG</src><caption>Daddy outside the V and A</caption></image>

    <title>30th Birthday - Chartwell (NT)</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy's birthday proper. Mummy and Daddy returned back to Istead Rise, after a lovely breakfast at the hotel, whilst I went to church at St Nicholas.</p><p>In the afternoon we said goodbye to one set of grandparents and said hello to the other. The Fars met us at Chartwell, Winston Churchill’s home. Daddy and Farfar were really interested looking around the place, learning a bit more about the person. The house was in a lovely setting over-looking south Kent/East Sussex. There was even a croquet lawn with members playing, which Farfar couldn't resist to go and poke his awe into.</p><p>We had a picnic and some birthday cake there and the weather was très hot. Daddy had bad hay fever.</p><p>We finally returned home knackered, and a pool of water on the floor. Now the freezer was added to the list of washing machine and boiler which all didn't work. Daddy sorted the dodgy electrics and spent his birthday evening defrosting the freezer!!!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_07_10-11-BirthdayChartwell.JPG</src><caption>Chartwell</caption></image>

    <title>30th Birthday - Boys Night Out and Oldemor Moves To New Home</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy and I went over to see Karen and Summer and stayed over at Ma Ma's house for the night.</p><p>Daddy went out with his friends up to London in the afternoon. He met up with Barrie, James, Martin, Nick and Steve at Farnborough station. They met Michael at Waterloo. They then proceeded on a pub crawl, which took in a poker club, mid route.</p><ul><li><i>pub 1</i>Trafalgar (Waterloo)
        </li><li><i>pub 2</i>Slug and Lettuce (Bank)
        </li><li><i>pub 3</i>Weatherspoons (Old Street)
        </li><li><i>pub 4</i>Gutshot Club - Poker club (Clerkenwell Road)
        </li><li><i>pub 5</i>Weatherspoons (Old Street)
        </li><li><i>pub 6</i>Spread Eagle (Shoreditch High Street)
        </li><li><i>pub 7</i>Japanese selling beer on tap (Shoreditch)
        </li><li><i>pub 8</i>Browns (Shoreditch)
        </li></ul><p>The poker club was superb. Really tense because they played against proper players who liked to play strictly to the rules. It was welcoming enough. Daddy lasted longest out of the boys, which wasn't very long really. Dawg, Michael and James even played on an unofficial cash table, whilst the rest of us battled on the chess boards. definitely a place to go back to in the future.</p><p>The Spread Eagle was an interesting place with weird looking rockers. A band played some really loud music, which Daddy got into. The others wanted to leave.</p><p>The 'crawl' ended sloppily at Browns. The main aim of the game was to avoid putting a quid in the pot!</p><p>Managed to catch the last train home. Dawg was well and truly out of it. We managed to almost strip him and tie him to the train seat. A good time had by all.</p><p>In the meantime Oldemor moved back from hospital where she was recovering from a broken hip to her new permanent residence in Gentofte.</p>

		<p>Mummy and I went from Istead Rise down to Eastbourne, whilst Daddy was dying in Michael and Ellie's car. He practically fell out of their car. A bit of a hangover, which soon went after a bit of fresh sea air.</p><p>We met up with Grandpop and Howard who are sailing around the south coast at the moment. We walked along the pier, had lunch in a cafe, played on the beach (I loved paddling in the sea), went for a boat trip to Beachy Head, and walked along the promenade to the marina. The weather was perfect and we had a real nice relaxing time.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_07_16-08-Eastbourne.JPG</src><caption>Eastbourne Beach</caption></image>

    <title>2nd Birthday - Mummy's and Daddy's Friends</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went to church, whilst Daddy went to pick the Fars from their trip to Denmark. They had been moving stuff from Oldemor's flat into her new home.</p><p>We decided to split the birthday parties up this year as we felt it might be too much to do one big one. So this is the first of three, which included mummy's and daddy's friends.</p><p>We went to Frensham Ponds for a picnic. The weather was absolutely scorching, almost too hot to walk on the sand. Daddy and I played lots in the water.</p><p>In the evening mummy was in 'nesting mood' man she was like a machine going around spring cleaning. Me and Daddy just chilled and played.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_07_17-01-FrenshamPonds.JPG</src><caption>The Crew</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_07_17-02-FrenshamPonds.JPG</src><caption>Playing In The Sand</caption></image>

    <info>
		<p>Oliver and I had a joint 2nd birthday party in the back garden. We had Ella, Joey, Summer, Henry, Joshua and of course Oliver playing toys and games in the back garden. Even Daddy managed to come for a bit. I got many nice presents. The party went on for 5 hours, culminating in birthday cakes for the birthday children.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_07_22-02-KatieBirthday2ndFriends.JPG</src><caption>In My Spanish Dress</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_07_22-03-KatieBirthday2ndFriends.JPG</src><caption>Party Food</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_07_22-06-KatieBirthday2ndFriends.JPG</src><caption>Summer Blowing Raspberries</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_07_22-11-KatieBirthday2ndFriends.JPG</src><caption>Working down t pit</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_07_22-13-KatieBirthday2ndFriends.JPG</src><caption>Preparing For A Game Of Pass The Parcel</caption></image>

    <title>2nd Birthday - London Zoo</title>
    <info>
		<p>As my birthday treat we went up to London Zoo. We caught the choo choo train from Woking and then tubed and bussed it to the zoo.</p><p>We wandered around the giraffes, then the aviary, penguins, lions, tigers, gorilla and finally the aquarium. I loved looking at all the animals.</p><p>The zoo was not nearly as impressive as the other zoo's and safari parks we'd been to. In fact it was quite embarrassing how old and run down it looked. It seemed that only half the enclosures had animals in them!</p><p>Still, we decided to walk back to the tube through Regents Park. The Ashes (cricket) was being beamed live from Lords to a big screen in the park, so there were loads of people around. It was a very nice stroll.</p>

		<p>Mummy and I went to church, whilst Daddy went to play golf in the pouring rain with Michael and Martin.</p><p>In the afternoon we were supposed to have a family BBQ, but due to the bad weather we had 20 people inside the house, which was pretty manic.

    <title>Coral Reef</title>
    <info>
		<p>The weather has been pretty poo all week, and today was no exception. After lunch we went to Coral Reef with Ellie, Michael and Joey. I loved it there. Daddy took me on the big flumes, which I wanted to go on again and again. I loved all the little ancillary pools, in and out, in and out. We even went on the rapid river without being held. I am becoming so confident in the water with the arm bands. Daddy reckons I should now try and actually do some swimming!!!</p><p>Afterwards we all went back and had a cup of tea. Farfar popped around in the evening.</p>

    <title>Into labour</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today started like any normal day. Daddy went off to work, whilst mummy and I had a busy day scheduled. We went off to a country park over towards Leatherhead with Ma Ma, Ellie and Joseph. Mummy was getting mild contractions during the day, but this wasn't unusual over the last few days. Daddy went to football training.</p><p>When daddy got back from football training, mummy's contraction begun. She had a bath, but they were becoming more regular and sharper as time went on. We pulled auntie Charlotte from a pub in Gravesend to come and look after me, before mummy and daddy made the trip to Frimley Park Hospital at about 11:30pm. They were given room J, were under the care of student nurse Vicky K and Jane Palmer. They were very friendly and supportive midwives.</p><p>Approaching midnight, mummies contractions had in fact eased to one every 5 minutes, and wondered whether going to hospital was really necessary.</p>

    <title>Benjamin Alan Uhrskov Gay</title>
    <first name="benjamin">Appearance into the world</first>
    <info>
		<p>By 1 o'clock mummy's contractions were back on track and she was taking on gas and air. An examination had taken place. The cervix wall was quite thick, and was only 3cm dilated. Mummy was not happy at this news, thinking that she was going be in for a long labour like Katie.</p><p>The contraction were getting stronger and by 2 o'clock mummy was on the pethadene. Daddy was continually giving support, words of encouragement, back massages and more importantly a hand, a finger to squeeze, a neck to strangle, and a face to scratch!!! By 3:30am mummy was pleading for her mother and for an anaesthetist to give her an epidural. The pain was so much mummy was reduced to pleading like a little girl would do for her dollies or something she really wanted. She was desperate for some pain relief. However, the midwives and daddy wanted to steer away from this. By 4:20am, mummy was fully dilated and time had come to push. It was a difficult half an hour, but finally the head popped out after 2 or 3 pushes. It was an amazing sight for daddy to see the little baby's head. However their seemed to be a complication and Daddy was asked to ring the buzzer for outside help. 2 or 3 pushes later the rest of the baby was born, with the umbilical cord wrapped around its head. The cord was cut by the nurse, and as they quickly rushed it over to the ressuitere. Daddy noticed it was a boy. The sister who had joined us give a dose of narcane to resuscitate the baby. Mummy and Daddy were both really worried, but also quite emotional that they had given birth to a baby boy. We were assured he would be OK. A second dose of narcane did bring him round.</p><p>He was cleaned up and checked over. Mummy then gave birth to the placenta 5 minutes after Benjamin was born, and then mummy and Benjamin had their first cuddle. Daddy had one as well. He weighed in at a might 9lbs 2oz, but he really didn't look that big.</p><p>He didn't look that battered and bruised. He had a slight cone head, and the eyes were puffed up, otherwise he had petite facial features. His hands looked like old mans, his scrotum was swollen and feet were really spread as if his toes were stretched. He had a slight tongue tie, like Katie, and he seems to have two bottom holes, one sealed up. He took to the breast straight away which was a great news.</p><p>Mummy then had to have 2 stitches, before we were left alone as a three.</p><p>Jane and Vicky were superb midwives, and we were very lucky to have them.</p><p>Over the next 4 hours we made our phone calls. The Fars were out in Denmark at the time. Mummy had a bath and we packed up and were ready to move over to the maternity ward. Mummy was settled in, and Daddy returned back home, where Charlotte, Ellie and Ma Ma looked after me. Daddy went to bed to get some sleep for a few hours, whilst mummy done the same. Because mummy had 'Strep B', Benjamin was under close observation. At one point his temperature went right down, so he was wrapped up well and had an electric blanket over him.</p><p>Daddy returned with Katie and the Weston girls at 3pm, for their first viewing. At first Katie thought it was Joey lying in the cot, but she soon was told and she gave him a kiss. She was more concerned with hiding in the curtains than seeing Benjamin.</p><p>We had Great Grandma and Grand ad, Auntie Sue and Karen come to visit as well. It was chucking out time at 5pm, for rest and meal time. Daddy returned home with me and fed and bathed me before putting me to bed. Daddy fell asleep and was awakened by Karen who kindly baby sat, whilst Daddy returned back to Hospital, going via McDonalds to get Mummy a Big Mac (The hospital food wasn't all that)!!!</p><p>Auntie Susan came to visit as well as Laura who had just finished her shift. Daddy left at 9pm, leaving Mummy to look after Benjamin. Benjamin was quite noisy for a while, disturbing the rest of the ward, so mummy got one of the midwives to settle him.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_08_05-01-Benjamin.JPG</src><caption>First ever picture of Benjamin</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_08_05-02-Benjamin.JPG</src><caption>Mummy and Benjamin on Labour bed</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_08_05-03-Benjamin.JPG</src><caption>The proud parents</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_08_05-04-Benjamin.JPG</src><caption>What a big chap</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_08_05-05-Benjamin.JPG</src><caption>Disco moves</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_08_05-06-Benjamin.JPG</src><caption>A south paw then!</caption></image>

    <title>Back Home From Hospital, Selling the car and Shopping</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy wanted to come home from hospital as soon as possible, even though the nursing staff wanted her to stay in for 48 hours, due to the 'Strep B'. Daddy and Katie came</p><p>She and Benjamin were discharged at about 11am. Daddy went over to Farnborough North to pick up some Hungarians who were interested in Mummy's car. Not only did Daddy pick them up from the station, they also stuck around for 2 hours inspecting the car and sorting out insurance!! Anyway they bought the car for the full asking price and they knew of all the defects, so we were happy to finally sort that out. Afterwards Laura was desperate to get some nursing bra's so Benjamin. So for Benjamin's first outing we went to the Meadows! Great. The meadows on a Saturday with a one day old baby. We also got some provisions in from Tesco before returning home.</p><p>Karen was a life saver and brought round dinner (Cottage Pie) which she had prepared at home. I can't say how much we appreciated it, not having a proper meal for a day or so.</p><p>Later on in the evening we had visits from Ma Ma, Grandpop, Uncle Howard and Charlotte. A pretty stressful day all in all.</p><p>Benjamin slept like a dreamboat. We put him down at 10:30, he woke for a feed at 11:30pm and then went all the way around to 4:30am for his next feed.</p><p>We don't think Katie really understands that Benjamin is a part of the family. She gives him kisses and strokes him, and says 'Benjamin wake up!'. She also wants Daddy to take Benjamin in order for Mummy to pick her up. She doesn't have a problem with Joey as such, but mummy and daddy are not given her as much attention.</p>

    <info>
		<p>We did jobs on Sunday morning. The boys (that's Daddy and Benjamin!) , typically watched the end of a memorable 2nd Ashes match. England won by 2 runs!</p><p>Both Susan and Graham popped over to see us, before Daddy took Katie off for the weekly food shop, back again at the Meadows! Benjamin and Mummy got about half an hours sleep before the midwife came to see us. She said everything looked to be in order. Ellie, Michael and Joseph turned up, as did Uncle John Garratt, Great Grandma and Grand ad, Ma Ma, Karen and Richard.</p><p>Benjamin didn't have a good night’s sleep. I think it wasn't until 3 or 4 o'clock before he finally settled down.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_08_07-23-Ben2days.JPG</src><caption>A south paw then!</caption></image>

    <info>
		<p>Again in the morning we were all getting over the backlog of jobs that have seemed to have accrued. Mummy and Katie went off for a while down the shops, whilst Daddy had some one on one time with Benjamin. In the afternoon Daddy took Katie off to Coral Reef, whilst Mummy and Benjamin tried to catch up on some sleep. However, the midwife came around. Katie could quite literally spend all day in Coral Reef. She went down the flumes again. Her favourites are the smaller slides which jumps down, goes down backwards or on her tummy.</p><p>Barrie, Laura and Freya popped over to see us in the afternoon. Finally we seem to be getting into a routine.</p>

		<p>We were getting rid of so many jobs. Daddy and Katie spent all morning cleaning the car and motorbike which was great fun. Katie decided it would be a good idea to scrub next doors fence as well! After the midwife and lunch we went to meet up with Ellie and Joey for fizzy kids. Katie had loads of fun.</p><p>Later on, Katie fell down three quatres of the stairs. It was bound to happen one of these days. She is quite fearless and adventurous at the moment, which is great to see in some respects.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_08_09-01-Ben4Days.JPG</src><caption>Katie not impressed by Benjamin's crying</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_08_09-02-Ben4Days.JPG</src><caption>Katie thinks Benjamin's crying is funny</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_08_09-03-Ben4Days.JPG</src><caption>Oh oh.

    <title>West Midlands Safari Park</title>
    <first name="ben">Day trip</first>
    <info>
		<p>The Fars came around for their first viewing of Benjamin. They had just got back from seeing Oldemor in Denmark.</p><p>We then headed north towards Kidderminster, and had our first proper family day out at a safari park. It was a long old journey, but Benjamin was a good boy sleeping (as per usual) all the way.</p><p>After lunch on top of the hill, watching the 'no nos' (rhinos) trot around, we started the drive around the park. It was really good, Katie absolutely loving it. The distinguishing feature about this park was that you were able to feed some of the animals. So there were giraffes and deer poking their heads into cars for food. We really appreciated how big giraffes really are. They are massive.</p><p>We then went into the amusements area where there were more animals to be seen, including the hippo lake. Katie's long lasting memory from the day is when she got trapped with mummy with a bat fluttering around them. They both screamed and were very scared. We took a ride on the train and went to the sea lion show. Katie was getting very tired and grumpy so we left before the end for the 2.5 hour trip home.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_08_11-21-WestMidlandsSafariPark.JPG</src><caption>No nos</caption></image>

		<p>In the morning we all met up with Ellie and Joey to do the weekly food shop.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_08_15-02-KatieJoey.JPG</src><caption>Katie and Joey</caption></image><p>In the afternoon we went around to see Mrs Oddie. We felt very sorry for her as she was very lonely and poor. Her house was in a bit of a state. Sad to see. Anyway she held Benjamin all the time we were there which I think made her day.</p><p>Later in the afternoon Katie helped Daddy doing jobs around the shops.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Auntie Ellie was going for a job interview at Sainsbury’s so we went over to baby sit Joey. We took him for a walk around the duck pond. He's such a happy, well behaved boy.</p><p>We raced over to Istead Rise where we met up with Anna and Helen. We then went to Swanley Park where we went on the train ride, played in the paddling pool, went on the huge playground, went on the ladybird fairground ride and had an ice lolly pop. The weather was scorching.</p><p>In the evening we stayed over at Ma Ma's house.</p>

    <title>Frensham Ponds</title>
    <info>
		<p>We returned back home from Istead Rise to see the health visitor for the first time. Benjamin is doing fine and his weight is just under the 91st percentile. He has put on 18 ounces in 12 days! Even Auntie Lat can't compete with that! Only joking Char.</p><p>In the afternoon we went over to Frensham Ponds with the Fars and played in the water again, which Katie absolutely loved. She is quite happy to play in the water by herself. She had a routine of running into the water until she falls over, goes back to the beach part where someone has dug a little pool and run in again, and again and again.</p>

    <title>Down to the Beach at the Witterings</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was a gorgeous day. Up into the high twenties. So we ventured down to the beach at West Wittering. It took a while to get there. Daddy and Benjamin walked from East Wittering so not to pay the expensive parking! How tight.</p><p>Anyway Daddy and Katie had fun in the sea, jumping the waves, making sand castles on the beach and playing with the ball. Katie absolutely loved it and could have spent a whole holiday there. Mummy and Benjamin on the other hand were chilling on the sandy beach. Both Katie and Daddy had a bit of sun burn by the end of the day.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_08_18-11-WestWittering.JPG</src><caption>Where's the sea gone?</caption></image>

    <info>
		<p>Whilst it was Daddy's first game of the season for Casuals, it was also Benjamin's first trip to church. That boy will soon learn. Daddy was busy losing 6-2 with Casuals, although the boys played well in the second half.</p><p>In the afternoon Daddy took Katie swimming, and began deflating the arm bands in order for her to try harder whilst floating in the pool. All Katie was interested in was doing full on dives into the swimming pool.</p>

		<p>It was carnage on the Basingstoke Canal today as we went out for Rachel's birthday. We were in the boat with Karen and Richard, and the boys took us into the brambles more times than I care to remember. They were rubbish rowers. Mummy went potty when Daddy stood up in the boat, and Richard got an earful for not turning the boar around. A nice relaxing trip up the canal! Other than that it was quite peaceful and Katie and Benjamin both enjoyed themselves.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_08_27-09-OdihamRowing.JPG</src><caption>I wish I was on that boat</caption></image><p>We had a picnic with the rest of the crew, Jon, Jason, Becky, Rachel, Ellie, Joey and Michael at Odiham castle, which was good. We played around the castle ruins all afternoon; hide and seek, and houses.</p><p>In the evening, just before bath time, Katie ran up to mummy and showed her the state of the potty. Katie had taken the initiative to wee wee in the potty without us prompting her. Well done Katie.</p>

		<p>It was another glorious day weather wise. We decided to head down to Bournemouth for another day at the beach. We started off around the shops, before having our picnic in winter gardens, which was nice.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/Bournemouth-25-2005_08_29.JPG</src><caption>Digging fortresses to stop them Germans</caption></image><p>We then hit the beach where we played in the sea for a bit, then spent ages making a big sea defence wall. However, the sea never made it up to us.

		<p>Yet another hot muggy day. We spent the morning at Beddington Park near Croydon where we went for a long walk and of course a go on the swings. We popped into a pub in Whyteleafe before we continued onto 'Auntie Fonas' (as Katie pronounces her) 30th birthday party.</p><p>It was good to catch up again with people. Karen and Richard were there as well as Helen and Nigel. 10 out of 10 for Kelly's organization and 11 out of 10 for Fee's mum's super fruit cocktail sticks and raspberry pavalova. Mmmm.</p>

    <title>White Cliffs of Dover, Deal Beach, Alan and Linda's, On to the Yacht</title>
    <info>
		<p>Possibly our busiest day ever. We drove down to the coast and first stopped off at St Margaret Bay where we saw the white cliffs of Dover, and threw stones on the beach. Daddy I think enjoyed that more than anyone. He was skimming the stones across the others to see them smash up and rebound in different directions. We say some big boats (ferries). We had our doughnuts before setting off to Deal. It was difficult to park, so we ended up nearly in Sandwich. We found a nice spot on the beach and had our picnic. It was fun to see the waves crashing in, although Katie was a bit scared of them.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_09_10-StMargretsBay.JPG</src><caption>White cliffs of Dover</caption></image><p>After our picnic we went to visit 2nd Cousins; Alan, Lynda and Sharon. It was a lovely afternoon in their back garden. It wasn't long before Katie was running around the garden and Alan left to hold Benjamin. Farfar and Farmor turned up a little later on as did Sharon who has now moved in around the corner with Shwan. David has now moved to Hemel Hempstead with his girlfriend. Otherwise the family are fit and well.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_09_10-LyndaKatie.JPG</src><caption>Lynda playing with Katie</caption></image><p>We moved on to the third leg of our day towards the Isle of Sheppey, where we were going to sleep on Ma Ma and Pop Pops yacht. We had dinner at the pub on the corner (Daddy had Muscles). For some reason we all went to bed at about 8:30pm. Daddy began by sleeping outside, before it became too cold. Space was at a premium. Mummy, Katie and Benjamin had a bed to themselves. However, the night was filled with children crying, feeding and wanting cuddles off mummy. Needless to say when the alarm went off at 5:30am there was some relief.</p>

    <title>Sailing up the Medway and Swimming</title>
    <info>
		<p>Pop Pop and Daddy started us off very early. It was a lovely peaceful time of day. The sun hadn't risen fully, so we sailed in the half light on a calm Medway, with container depots, gas towers and distant street lamps from Southend as a view. Bliss.</p><p>As Mummy, the 'mota, mota' queen had gone back to sleep, we attempted putting the sails up. However, we were going against the tide and were only doing 1.4 knots!!! So 'mota' it was. We sailed passed a huge container ship from Japan that was being unloaded. Absolutely massive. It had at least 12x16x9 (1728) large containers on it. I wonder what was on it. The rest of the crew eventually appeared to enjoy the rest of the cruise. It was a bit cold on deck for Benjamin, but Katie enjoyed waving to other boats and going up and down the steps. 3 hours after we departed Queenborough, we moored in Gillingham Marina.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_09_11-Ma MaKatie.JPG</src><caption>Yachting is a fun old game</caption></image><p>We stopped off for a spot of lunch at Ma Ma's before returning home in the early afternoon. Daddy and Katie went swimming again for over an hour whilst Mummy and Benjamin watched. A very tiring, demand, but enjoyable weekend.</p>

		<p>We headed west towards Bristol Zoo. It was a nice zoo, animals behind glass cages which you could go right up to. Mummy and Katie's favourite animal was the Gorilla (or grilla), Daddy's was the toucan, for its colourful, vivid beak. Benjamin enjoyed the day asleep!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_09_17-05-BristolZoo.jpg</src><caption>Spot The 'Grilla'</caption></image>

		<p>After church we went down to Brighton for the afternoon. The weather continues in it's fine vain of form. We bought lunch at the Cornish Pasty shop and went to the beach to eat it and watch the weirdo's go by. There were lots of things going on, on the beach from bands playing music, to people playing various sports. It was even hot enough for people to sunbath. Daddy popped off to find some clothes, but found nothing, except for a birthday present for Auntie Susan. The rest of us went for a quick walk along the beach. We hurried back for tea.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_09_18-02-Brighton.JPG</src><caption>Pasties On Brighton Beach</caption></image>

    <title>Golf and Charlotte Moving In At Uni</title>
    <info>
		<p>Auntie Susan had given Daddy some golf lessons for his 30th birthday, and today was the day he was going to take them. He went to the Marriott Hotel where he had 2x45 minute lessons. Daddy has now got a completely new grip, told not to slouch, and told to push the club through. The lessons were other side of a free lunch, anything from the menu, and an uninterrupted listen to his favourite 'Fighting Talk' on Five Live!</p><p>He met up with the rest of us who had gone down with Ma Ma and Pop Pop to help Charlotte settle in at her new digs in Abbott Road, Charminster. It's only a 5 minute walk from where Daddy lived 8 or 9 years ago. A trip down memory lane. TIP: Winton high street is rubbish for shopping!</p><p>Charlotte has got a nice big house, sharing with 5 others. Her room is small and it was quite a job to fit everything in, but some things have already had to go. We haven't seen the other house mates yet. I think Charlotte, although a little apprehensive, will love the partying down there.</p>

    <title>Bazza Mayhem</title>
    <info>
		<p>Church in the morning. We then went with the Elders over to the West’s for Sunday lunch. It was quite an event. Bazza was still half way building the downstairs area, so there was a stud wall and lots of pipes and wires hanging around! Ideal for kids and especially the Gays! Well Daddy almost brought the pipe work down when he stumbled over a bit of stud and went crashing into the pipes with all his weight. Luckily there was a bit of scaffold wedging up the ceiling that stopped him from falling completely over!</p><p>The meal was lovely, but if it wasn't Freya crying for food or tiredness, it was Benjamin. Katie was going nuts at being stuck indoors and poor Joey was projectile vomiting big styley.</p><p>It was good to see everyone again, but I don't think we're really fit for visiting people.</p><p>Both Joey and Freya have got fantastic smiles.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Daddy made his first serious motorbike trip on the motorway over to Istead Rise. He met up with Pop Pop and Howard and went off to see Charlton V Spurs. They got to the ground early. The atmosphere was good, had good seats and best of all a good match. Charlton were 2-0 up, and then had the match stolen from them, and lost 3-2! Afterwards the boys ventured to Plumbsted Working Men's club for a spot of ale. The motorbike trip home was interesting in the dark and wet!</p><p>Meanwhile the rest of us went over to Ellie and Michael's. Michael looked after Katie, whilst the others went to a NCT sale. Katie enjoyed herself and was well behaved!!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_10_01-BenjaminSmiling.jpg</src><caption>Benjamin Has Just Began Smiling</caption></image>

She went in with Benjamin. Katie was unsupervised and had jumped into the swimming pool. Somehow her armbands had come off.</p><p>Daddy returned to the swimming pool and Mummy was screaming 'Where's Katie'. We looked around and she was lying on her back, no armbands, scrabbling to keep afloat. A man was over looking and said she was doing well. We just got her in time. Goodness knows how long Katie was like that for. What a scary incident though.</p></woops><p>Anyway we had a good time swimming otherwise and Katie had regained her confidence by the end of the session.</p><p>In the afternoon Daddy went off with the boys down to meet up with Charlotte in Bournemouth, whilst the rest of us went to Karen's, with Ellie and Joey.</p><p>Daddy felt a bit ill that night!!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_10_21-00-Benjamin.JPG</src><caption>Bengelmin</caption></image>

Lots of ponds, pigeons and mallards.</p><p>We finished our walk just in time for the heavens to open. We went inside and there were quite a few interactive games and activities for Katie to do. Katie made two smiley faces from paper plates.</p><p>In the evening Charlotte came around to stay.</p>

Making good progress, but then a spark hit my eye brow and thought better put some eye protection on. I had no glasses, so turned to my bike helmet. The grinder made a heck of a noise and woke Katie up. Laura brought her down, crying her eyes out, seeing me with an angle grinder, a load of mess and commotion and a bike helmet on! I think I may have given her nightmares that night.</p><image woopstitle="Loppers and Angle Grinder to Fix Washing Machine" forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_11_10-WashingMachneDIY.JPG</src><caption>Holey Washing Machines!!</caption></image><p>Anyway I had to quit the angle grinder and thought how I was going to cut the other two sides. Ended up retrieving the loppers from the garage and cutting my way through the rest. Finally had to make the hole bigger, and eventually fixed it right. The only problem now is that the washing machine doesn't fit flush because the metal bits stick out of the back!!!</p></woops>

We went for a tractor ride and there were plenty of swings, wendy houses and slides to go on. Katie didn't care much for the big inflatable slide. Always one to say she wants to try things, but when it comes to it, always seems to wimp out. Katie had a go on the boats with Mummy before we all got a bit too cold and returned to the cafe and play area for a cup of tea, cake and soft play.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_11_13-11-FishersFarm.JPG</src><caption>Farfar and Ben!!</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_11_13-02-BenMartin.JPG</src><caption>Daddy and Ben</caption></image>

I'm not sure Andrew and George quite knew what they were letting themselves in for.</p><p>Anyway after a spot of lunch we headed into the cold and visited Matlock Farm. It was bitterly cold and empty. The animals in there were enthusiastic to see us and very vocal. Everyone was a scaredy pants and wouldn't stroke or feed the animals.

    <title>Andrew And Georges - Chatsworth House</title>
    <info>
		<p>George had an early start. Ben and Daddy watched Match Of The Day, whilst the rest of the house were having a mini lye in.</p><p>We headed off to Chatsworth House, which has got to be the most impressive and grand house we've ever seen. It was set with some stunning surroundings. The house inside had lots of Christmas decorations which set a really warm and festive atmosphere.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_11_27-08-AndrewGeorges.JPG</src><caption>Festive Chatsworth House</caption></image><p>Because of the night before and the cold weather, the kids were in bad form. so much so, we couldn't really relax and enjoy the place. Every room had impressive art on the walls and ceiling. We went to the stables which was lovely. There was a Christmas brass orchestra, and plenty of Christmas nik-naks to buy.</p><p>Somewhere defiantly to re-visit in warmer times.</p><p>After lunch, we made the long journey home. I think we may have put Andrew and George off having children. They were quite hard work.</p>

		<p>Daddy had a half day and went up with Nick and Martin to London for a couple of beers at the Wellington and Sussex Arms.</p><p>Then went off to the main event at Brixton Academy to see the Prodigy. It was mental. Jumping, pushing, chanting. Superb.</p><p>Highlights:</p><ul><li>Martin's spilling the wine all over the table and most of my meal.</li><li>Nick throwing a spoonful of rice over Martin in the restaurant with the waiter watching. He quickly cleared the table!</li><li>Goading Nick to come off/stay on the tube. He didn't make it. The doors shut across his body, he struggles free a bit, but his leg if defo stuck. Needed man off platform to pull him out.</li><li>Wiping the stolen rice spoon. 'Sniff and pass it on'</li><li>Pool: Nick nil! Buying that James a drink.</li><li>The cold, drenched t-shirt at the end.</li></ul>

    <title>Katie and Ben's Development</title>
    <first>Ben taking Baby Rice</first>
    <info>
		<p>Both Katie and Ben are both developing well. Katie is a bossy little madam, straight out of mummy's mould. She has an excellent vocabulary, very loving, and she can remember things from weeks ago. However, if she doesn't get her own way, then she'll moan until mummy gives in. (which isn't very long). She normally goes to bed at 6:45pm, sometimes it takes a while for her to settle down. She wakes 2 or 3 times a night, until wake up time of anything between 6:15 and 6:45.</p><p>Ben is a lot more chilled then Katie was. He does cry and is sick more often, but he has the most gorgeous of smiley faces. He can be entertained by bumping him on your knee and tickling him. He has just become better at sleeping. He's always been good in the early evening - nothing wakes him. He'll then generally wakes at midnight and 5am, give or take a couple of hours!</p>

    <title>Canal Ride - Father Christmas</title>

		<p>Daddy took a half day from work and we all went along to the Canal Centre at Mytchett. Ellie, Joey, Caroline, Henry, Sarah and Oliver all came to. We caught a barge that took us 15 minutes up the canal to a wooded area. We followed the tinsel trail to Father Christmas' little helper. We entered his Grotto which was very well made out, with loads of bails of straw to sit on. Father Christmas told some stories, sang some songs and finally gave some presents out. It was really good. Katie was a bit tired, but seemed to be taking lots in. We took the 5 minute walk back to the barge and motored back for a cup of tea and a mince pie.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_12_15-CanalCollage.jpg</src><caption>This year’s Christmas Tree effort</caption></image>

		<p>We left Daddy at home wrapping Christmas Presents while the rest of us went to church. We went for a little gathering at the Fars, as this will be the last time we see them before they head off to Denmark for Christmas. It was our first chance to pen presents this year! Aunty Susan and Graham were there as well.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_12_18-05-TheFars.jpg</src><caption>Farmor entertaining Benjamin</caption></image><p>After a quick lunch we scooted up to London to see the lights down Oxford and Regent Street's. There was no contest. Regent Street were far better. Katie sat on Mummy's lap in the front so she could see everything. Ben slept all the way and back again.</p>

    <title>Christmas Eve</title>
    <info>
		<p>This year was a bit different. The Fars had gone to Denmark to see Oldemor. The first Christmas for Daddy without the Fars and a Danish Christmas meal :(. We wrapped presents and done some jobs in the morning. Later, Daddy and Katie went to try and find a swimming pool that was open - Farnborough. Daddy managed to smack his nose on the bottom of the pool whilst he was showing off doing a hand stand and slipping! Mummy rushed Ben to hospital as she was worried about his breathing. No problems though.</p><p>Steven popped around for a chat and a cup of tea, we went to bed and Daddy attempted to make a Danish Christmas meal. Not a great effort. In the end it was a pork chop, peas, boiled potatoes and caramelized potato.</p><p>We left out some milk, a mince pie, a carrot for Rudolph and some Reindeer dust on the front path for Father Christmas. It was so cute to see Katie believe in it all.</p>

    <title>Christmas Day - The Weston’s</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy woke us up at 6am to open presents! Of course Katie opened her biggest, the kitchen, before any of the others, which meant she was not interested in any of the others! Any case we opened the presents and the stockings. After a bite of breakfast we made our way early over to the Weston household where the Elders where staying.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_12_25-07-ChrsitmasDay.JPG</src><caption>Ben opening first present</caption></image><p>We all went to church except Daddy, who caught up on some sleep and Uncle Michael who wasn't feeling very well (a dickie tummy).</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_12_25-09-ChrsitmasDay.JPG</src><caption>Mummies and Babies</caption></image><p>... then the main event - Christmas Lunch.

A very nice meal prepared by Pop Pop.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_12_25-11-ChrsitmasDay.JPG</src><caption>It’s a cracker</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_12_25-16-ChrsitmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Turkey-loni</caption></image><p>After tidying up and a walk around the block, we opened some more presents. Wow We. Katie absolutely loved handing out all the presents. I think that was the bit she enjoyed more than anything.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_12_25-24-ChrsitmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Hmm - Not sure about this</caption></image><p>That took a while. We then played some board games in the evening... well DVD games actually.</p><p>The busy night ended up with all 4 of us in the same bed together! A bit of a squeeze, but lovely none the less.</p>

We parked on the sea front and caught a train to the end of the burnt out pier. We then went on a toy taxi and bus, before sheltering in a cafe for a cup of tea and a glass of water. We braved it out into the shopping centre where Daddy bought a bright pink Barbie coat for Katie.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2005/2005_12_26-02-BoxingDaySouthend.JPG</src><caption>Katie with Southend Pier</caption></image><p>Helen popped over in the afternoon which was nice.</p><p>In the late afternoon the Barnett clan came over for traditional fun and games.

It was very nice. Enjoyed the wine, or was it port?, the food a bit hot for Daddy, and of course the boys won the games.</p><p>As midnight approached Rachel and Jon performed their 'fire dance' which was superb. Then we let off a dozen fireworks, which woke Katie and Joey (somehow Ben slept through). The evening seemed to go in a flash. It was so nice to relax with friends - sounds so middle aged.</p>

But instead managed to see a lot of mud, which was quite comical as we had a small, plastic, 4-wheeled buggy to track through the mud.</p><p>We really enjoyed the walk. For:-</p><ul><li>the pub that was shut as we sought salvation from the elements.</li><li>the commands that 'chip chop' was barking out to us, as we tackled the buggy through the mud.</li><li>Daddy almost slipped into the mud whilst carrying Ben.</li><li>We never actually saw Waverly Abbey. A return visit required.</li><li>The inevitable rush back to the car as Ben was getting cold and hungry. The estimated 1 hour walk took 2 hours!</li></ul><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_01_07-03-TilfordWalk.JPG</src><caption>Muddy Walk</caption></image>

		<p>Daddy scored an amazing near post diving header from 10 yards out. 17 goals for Casuals now.</p><p>In the afternoon we went for a walk over the back of Red Road. We looked for the mythical animals that Daddy reckons live over there. We didn't see them again. Just droppings!</p>

		<woops woopstitle="Brakes failed, needed handbrake turn to stop car" rating="8"><p>Mummy drove over to Ellie's today. As we left the A31, down the slip road the brakes failed to work. Heading towards a fast and busy t-junction, mummy managed to pull the handbrake and turn just before the give way area. We were in the back. Mummy was a bit shaken.</p></woops><p>Daddy came over and took the car to the garage. However, they couldn't find anything wrong with the brakes. A bit worrying really, as what is to stop it from happening again?</p>

    <title>Whipsnade Zoo</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy and Daddy took us to the zoo today. We weren't too sure what to expect as Whipsnade Zoo is linked to the very disappointing London Zoo. It was rather strange it's a zoo where you kind of drive round a bit get out, see some animals and pop back into the car again.</p><p>Anyway, we started with feeding time with 4 brown bears. This was excellent, as we could see the bears move around, take water from their lake. They got apples, grapes, oranges and biscuits from Sainsbury's. Katie even throw some fruit to them. They looked pretty docile animals. The park was set out in a big oval, where you drive around to the next set of animals to see. The animals had plenty of room and it seemed a bit more humane than its sister London Zoo.</p><p>We saw the penguins, monkeys, wolves, antelope, giraffes, zebras, hippos, rhinos, lions, tigers, sea lions and finally elephants. The elephants were the highlight of the day as we saw 5 of them trunk to tail, marching down the path. We had to get out of the way quickly. Both Ben and especially Katie loved it.</p>

    <title>Joey First Birthday Trip To The Farm</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went for a stressful shopping trip to Guildford to get Joey and Freya's first birthday present. We met up at the Star pub for a bite to eat. The lamb shank was 'bonnet da douche'.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_01_28-BenGerry.jpg</src><caption>Ben With Pop Pop</caption></image><p>It was bitterly cold but we met up with Ma Ma, Pop Pop, Joey, Ellie and Michael for Joey's first birthday trip to Bocketts Farm. We saw the new piglets under a heat lamp guarded by a big pig (who reminded us of mummy!). We played in the sandpit, on the trampoline, slides, swings and wendy house. Who needs a farm when there are so many playground toys?</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_01_28-Ben.jpg</src><caption>Benjamin</caption></image><p>We were called to the barn where we were all able to stroke some of the smaller animals. Katie for the first time ever stroked a rabbit! Without being forced. It was so nice to see as she absolutely loves animals. Pop Pop was chatting up the farmer girl, whilst two guinea pigs were fighting each other! We walked around to see the horses, donkeys and llamas.</p><p>We ended the trip with a go in the play house, with us all having a go on the big slide.</p><p>In the evening we completed our Star Wars viewing by watching Return Of The Jedi.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_01_28-BenMartinMichaelJoeySlide.jpg</src><caption>Slippy Slidey</caption></image>

    <info>
		<p>Daddy's football in the morning was rubbish. Too tired. We of course went to church.</p><p>Ben is still waking loads in the night, 6 or 7 times. So he slept most of the afternoon. The Fars popped around for a quick cup of tea before we went off to the Church New Year’s Party!</p><p>I know it doesn't sound much fun, but there were games for the children for a couple of hours. Katie had a whale of a time running around and taking part in the games.</p><p>The funniest bit was when they began playing 'Gary Glitter's' - Come On, Come On during Pass The Parcel!! A bit un-PC!! We won in the raffle.... We had the ticket 666. Quite ironic for a church raffle.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_01_29-MartinAtChurchParty.jpg</src><caption>Daddy looking silly</caption></image>

    <title>First day at playschool</title>
    <first name="katie">First day at playschool</first>
    <info>
		<p>Katie's first day at Balmoral Drive's playschool or pre-school. We have been prepping her for the past month and talking very upbeat about it and had made her excited to go. Although quite what she thought was going to happen is very difficult to know.</p><p>We arrived after all the other kids had gone in so it wouldn't be so hectic and scary. Katie ran into the hall and played straight away on the slide. Mummy and Daddy spoke to the teacher for 5 minutes, and then slid out. Katie was fine and didn't seem to be bothered at all. It went better than we could have expected.</p><p>Mummy and Daddy were very happy and sad as it was confirmation of the next step of Katie's development and independence, which she slipped into seamlessly. Mummy having being in her presence 100% of the time felt it hardest to let go. A feeling of not being needed. Still we are all very proud of her.</p><p>She will be going Tuesdays, Thursday's and Friday's, 9:30 till 12:30. Playschool will hopefully bring structured play and social interaction with new children without mummy and daddy around. She will thrive with older children around. Also it gives Mummy a chance to have some 1 on 1 quality time with Ben which never happens. So this will benefit all of us.</p><p>Katie brought home 2 pictures and the teachers said she was very happy and confident. She played with new friends Gary and Louie.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_01_31-KatieFirstDayAtPlayschool.jpg</src><caption>First Day At Playschool</caption></image>

		<p>Today Katie cried and didn't want to go to Playschool. A similar story to yesterday. Mummy had to leave her crying, but the teacher said she cheered up 2 minutes after she had left. All the other kids seem a lot bigger than her. Anyway she still comes out having enjoyed her session.</p>

    <title>Ben's Christening</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ben's Big Day and at 6 months old he rather took a liking to his dress!! Helen's mum had kindly embroidered his name and date on the inside to join Katie's particulars, hopefully the gown can be used for other family christenings.</p><p>We made St Andrews church, Frimley Green for 9:30 on a cold, cloudy morning. We had a small section of the church for the 40 or so family and friends we had. It was so nice to see everyone come, especially those who had set out at 7am that morning!</p><p>The vicar had to work hard as the Christening service was merged with the traditional communion service. Mummy and Daddy spent most of the time trying to keep both Katie and Ben happy rather than listening to the service. Katie was a bit of a handful, she was loving the audience to her performance.</p><p>Oil was smeared onto Ben's forehead, water across his head and a candle lit to signify Ben's joining of the church. It was a lovely service which made us parents feel exceptionally proud.</p><p>We didn't get time to do photo's in the church which was our only regret of the day. We rushed off to Mytchett Bowls Club where we had some nibbles and drink. I thought Daddy gave an excellent speech.</p><p>Thanks for everyone who came and for the generous presents.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_05-32-BenChristening.jpg</src><caption>All The Family Kiddies Together</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_05-34-BenChristening.jpg</src><caption>The Barnett Family</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_05-37-BenChristening.jpg</src><caption>Shirley and Michael</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_05-41-BenChristening.jpg</src><caption>The Main Man With Parents</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_05-43-BenChristening.jpg</src><caption>Dixon’s Of Deal</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_05-45-BenChristening.jpg</src><caption>Godparent Auntie Susan and Graham</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_05-47-BenChristening.jpg</src><caption>The Godparents: Ellie, Michael, Charlotte and Susan</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_05-50-BenChristening.jpg</src><caption>Us With The Godparents</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_05-51-BenChristening.jpg</src><caption>The Gays</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_05-52-BenChristening.jpg</src><caption>The Main Man</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_05-54-BenChristening.jpg</src><caption>Junior Miss and Senior Mrs. Gay</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_05-61-BenChristening.jpg</src><caption>Ben Staying Focused Whilst Others Are Distracted</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_05-63-BenChristening.jpg</src><caption>Bennie</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_05-64-BenChristening.jpg</src><caption>Sneaking out for a run around outside</caption></image>

		<p>Well it was actually yesterday. We done jobs and went to the swings in the morning. It was pretty cold.</p><p>In the afternoon Daddy went off to Go-Karting at Aldershot. They've changed the track around since he last went, but still managed to get the quickest lap of the day (so far). Daddy won the trophy for 1st place. We then went to the Wellington Statue for a quick walk before returning home for a bite to eat.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_11-02-Karting.jpg</src><caption>Cruizzzinngg It</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_11-17-KarenKarting.jpg</src><caption>Discussing the sloppy driving</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_11-01-Karting.jpg</src><caption>Trophy Boy</caption></image><p>Richard had organised a disco in Crookham Social club for Karen's 30th.

We really didn't know if we were going to last 10 minutes or the whole film. Katie got scared during some of the bits but she enjoyed it and kept entertained throughout the 80 minute cartoon. Ben was Ben - awake and being a good boy. It was pretty expensive at 17 quid.</p><p>Uncle Dog and Joyce was the next destination. We went around for a nice chat and a cup of tea.</p>

    <title>London - Coram's Field and Roman Bath</title>
    <info>
		<p>We hadn't been to London in a long while and we decided to go up today. We looked in our free attractions in London book and came across a couple of places to visit.</p><p>
        We caught the tube from Turnham Green and then a bus to
        <a href="http://www.londontown.com/LondonInformation/Attraction/Corams_Fields/4359/">
          Coram's Field
        </a>
        which Katie enjoyed. Coram's Field is a 7 acre kids site, with playgrounds, animals and football pitches. It has a cafe and some buildings for kids to do playschool stuff. It was in a very nice setting. Would be great in the summer. Anyway Katie enjoyed playing on the playground, not too fussed about the animals though.
      </p><p>Next was a stressful lunch time... with Laura feeling ill, Katie climbing all over the place and Ben overdue for his lunch by an hour or so! Anyway we had a 32 inch pizza to share!... which we ate.</p><p>
        We bussed it down to Aldwych to see a
        <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-romanbath/">
          Roman Bath
        </a>
        - well it is advertised as this, but reading about it, it is not actually believed to be roman after all! It is strangest attraction you're likely to see. We were prepared for an anti-climax but the national trust 'bath' was tucked away in a back alley way, in a room which you could only view through a small, very low, dirty window. The bath itself looked interesting for the first 10 seconds. The workman close by said we could switch a light on that illuminated the bath.

		<p>We went for a walk, fed the ducks and play in the playground in the freezing weather.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_02_26-BenJetteSwing.jpg</src><caption>Ben and Farmor Swinging</caption></image><p behaviour="Katie">Over the past couple of weeks Katie's behaviour towards Daddy has been very standoff-ish. No kisses, very little closeness. It's been a tough time, where only Mummy can do anything for her. However, for some reason this weekend Daddy's little Katie has come back. She's has been an absolute delight to be around. We all really can't work out what has changed or what is going on. We have a suspicion that it might have something to do with her playschool visits, but why daddy gets the blame is very hard to say.</p>

    <title>Swimming With The Fars</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy went to an NCT Sale with Ellie and Sarah. The rest of us went around to the Fars to play. We then motored off to the Arena, although Farfar sailed off to Farnborough Leisure centre for some reason. Anyway, we met up with Auntie Susan. The pool was the busiest we've seen it. Could hardly move in there. The water was boiling. Katie loved running between the big and small pools. Ben enjoyed himself with the rattle. He seemed as though he wanted to drink the pool water.</p><p>In the afternoon we went for a nice walk our old stamping ground, Bagshot. Daddy wishes we still lived around here. He looked into the old house but couldn't see much. We ended up at the swings. It was bitterly cold.</p>

    <title>Great Granddad’s 83rd</title>
    <info>
		<p>Went to church in the morning, Katie wouldn't let mummy leave her in crèche which has been the same for a few weeks now. So we coloured and read books (Katie loves the three little pigs). Tried to give Ben milk from a cup and bottle but he only wants mummy’s milk. Went to the Quays pub for Great Granddads 83rd birthday meal. Ma Ma and Pop Pop and the Elders and Auntie Charlotte and Uncle John G were there. It was really nice. Katie spotted the swings outside and even though it was really cold she spent most of the time out there with the grownups taking turns to play. Went to Great Grandma and Granddads after for cake and Ma Ma and uncle John took Katie to the swings behind their house even though by now it was freezing, mummy and daddy took the opportunity to have a rest on the sofa as Ben was asleep in his car seat in Great Grandmas bedroom.</p>

		<p>We went to Frimley Lodge park today and fed the ducks. Katie laughed so much because she threw the bread and it landed on the ducks back. Ben loved going down the big slide with mummy, while Katie went down with her bubby. Today mummy was told off by Katie. Mummy said "can I have the bowl Katie"? and Katie said "say Please mummy".</p><p>Ben had his first lumpy meal today and panicked mummy silly when he coughed on it.  Mummy picked him up, patting his back like mad and then he was sick all over her!</p>

    <title>Chocolate World and Waterworld</title>
    <first name="Ben">Holiday</first>
    <info>
		<p>We made off early, without any stress, and reasonably on time which was pretty surprising. We played the list game on the way up where Katie would get a chocolate button every time she saw a post box, phone box, bus, lamp post, rabbit hutch (electrical box), traffic lights, bike, etc.. Katie managed to clear the packet.</p><p>We arrived early and stopped off in Kings Norton just south of Bourneville. It was a dump. Straight out of Only Fools and Horses. Bourneville itself looks really nice. Shame we never got the opportunity to look around it properly.</p><p>Cadbury World reminded me of Carlsberg a bit in terms of size and what it had to offer. A museum and tour on site of a mass producing factory.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_03_12-08-CadburyWorld.jpg</src><caption>Cadbury Factory</caption></image><p>We started the tour with 16 bars of chocolate! Katie and Mummies eyes lit up. We went through a dark forest to show where the cocoa beans come from, then a little on the history of Cadbury's, which was quite interesting. Katie rushed us on to the factory part of the tour where we could see conveyor belts of chocolate being wrapped. We made it to the wonka part, where we tasted liquid chocolate, dipped our fudge into chocolate and saw chocolate being mixed and put into moulds. We saw boxes and boxes of chocs. Finally we reached the end in the shop where there were some bargains. Daddy got two packs of mis-shapes for work.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_03_12-09-CadburyWorld.jpg</src><caption>Ben's Got A Choccy Bar</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_03_12-11-CadburyWorld.jpg</src><caption>Eating Liquid Chocolate</caption></image><p>We mucked about in the playground, before heading north, through the centre of Birmingham up into Stoke. The weather was windy, wet and bitterly cold. Welcome to the north. We searched for a swimming pool and stumbled across Waterworld in Stoke - The largest water park in the country. Just what the doctor ordered.</p><p>A steep 8 quid entrance fee, but the best water park we'd been to. An area was set aside for 2 year olds. Mini slides, flumes, play house and climbing net. Katie loved it and was bossing everyone about. Benjamin was enjoying it also.</p><p>Daddy had a go on a few of the flumes and loved the tire ride which went quick and included some uphill sections just like at Basingstoke. There were hardly any queues for the flumes. Definitely a place to go back to if we had a little more time.</p><p>We spent our first night at Stoke Talke Travelodge which was only 10 minutes away. Katie and Daddy ventured into Newcastle Under Lyne for some fish and chips. We all went to bed at 7:30pm and slept well.</p>

    <title>Knowsley Safari Park and Liverpool</title>
    <info>
		<p>We travelled over to a local Asda for some cooked breakfast. Daddy wasn't too impressed with it. Anyhow we motored up towards Liverpool and entered the desolate Knowsley Safari Park. We headed for the main building and fairground area. It was freezing. There was still snow on the ground which we played footprints in.</p><p>As one of the only cars on the Safari Park we motored without rushing past the deer.</p><p>We reached the lion enclosure with no one else about. There were seemingly 7 females and 1 male. We stopped close to a couple of them and admired their fine physiques. Our car seemed to gain interest amongst the rest of the pack. We quickly were surrounded, which for about 5 seconds was exciting. Then as soon as the Daddy lion fully extended his jaw to show us what clean teeth he had, combined with a couple of playful lions who started to pace around us, our excitement turned to nervous apprehension. We slowly crawled forward to move the lions out of the way so we could move on.</p><p>We moved around to see yet more deer related animals...... and eventually ended up in the Baboon enclosure. The ladies in the car were eager for one to jump on the car. Daddy just thought who was going to fix and pay for the damage! Killjoy. Anyway we had a couple clamber over the roof and perch themselves on the wing mirror much to the amusement of Katie.</p><p>The time of year didn't do the safari park any favours. Many animals, it seemed, were kept from our sight. All of the fairground type attractions were shut and there was just no one around to make any atmosphere mainly due to the bitter weather conditions. It was nice and smelly in the giraffe house which Ben and Daddy enjoyed. Daddy had a 30 minute conversation with the giraffes which he enjoyed as they made more sense than Mummy!</p><p>After a stressful lunch in the car we had one final tour around the park before moving on to Liverpool for a quick mooch around. We travelled in via the A57 and I thought Liverpool had been re-generated. Not a bit of it. Every other house was boarded up. Shops with metal grills on the front of them. It was terrible. A bit of an eye-opener.</p><p>We headed towards Albert Dock which we visited 10 years previous. Ben and Katie were asleep, so Daddy went to see if it was worth us paying the parking and walk about. It was so cold with the biting wind. Daddy enjoyed the walk about, but it really wasn't going to be enjoyable for the children. So the children kind of saw Liverpool as we exited south through a nice little industrial estate that Mummy took us to in Widnes, though Runcorn to Northwich where we stopped so that Katie ran around a nice pub!</p><p>We finally made it to Barthomley, Crewe where we stayed in another Travelodge for £10. We all went to bed at 8pm.</p>

    <title>Stafford Castle and Lichfield Cathedral</title>
    <info>
		<p>We left bright and early and was in Stafford by 9am. We stopped off at the Castle, walked up the hill to have breakfast and marvel at the Castle and views of the surrounding area.</p><p>We then ambled through some pleasant countryside to Lichfield. We parked up and had a lovely walk through the town to the domineering Cathedral. We toured around and saw a bible and angel which were 1300 years old!</p><p>We stopped off in a quiet country lane so Ben could have a feed. Daddy and Katie went for a short walk seeing some rabbits scampering across the path and played pooh sticks along a stream and bridge.</p><p>We raced home and collapsed, cleared up and again went to bed early. Overall a typical Gay trip - Enjoyable, long and tiring.</p>

        </li><li><i>Katie</i>"No not really." Said in a confident, uncompromising manner. That told Daddy.
        </li></ul><p>Katie's latest expression is "What a lot of.....". Cows, Lights, Rice, Dinner, Mud.</p><p>Her pronunciation of words cause a lot of delight for Mummy and Daddy. Our favourite at the moment is 'Fffffrosty'.</p><p>And she calls us Ma Ma and Dada which is very sweet.</p><p>After church we went with Charlotte on a walk from our book given to us by Uncle Steven. A 3.5 mile trek around the cow fields and rivers around Pyrford. It was pretty long for the children. It's just amazing how patient and tolerant Benjamin is. His nose was streaming constantly. He looked cold, but he didn't moan one bit. Obviously inherited his personality from Daddy!!! :)</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_03_19-25-PyrfordWalk.jpg</src><caption>Charlotte And Ben at Pyrford Lock</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_03_19-26-PyrfordWalk.jpg</src><caption>A church ruin</caption></image><p>Later on Katie wanted to some painting. However, it was too late.</p><ul><li><i>Katie</i>Ma Ma - do painting (carrying the paints)
        </li><li><i>Mummy</i>No Katie, it's a bit late darling
        </li><li><i>Katie</i>Well I smell the paints instead

		<p>Mummy picked Katie up from pre-school and on the way home we were discussing what Katie had done there, she said she had been naughty and had to sit on a special mat with one of the playschool ladies. Mummy asked Katie what she had done wrong and Katie said she kept wriggling around during story time. Mummy asked Katie if she is going to sit still on Thursdays playschool and Katie said no, she is going to wriggle! Mummy will have to explain to the playschool ladies that Katie does have ants in her pants when it comes to sitting still, but she is only little after all.</p>

		<p>Katie came home from preschool on Friday with a present and card for mummy. Since then mummy has been desperate to find out what it is. Mummy opened it this morning and it was a lovely box that Katie had decorated with a flower, with some Quality Street inside. In the end Katie ate most of the chocolates, but the thought was there! The card was lovely too, a butterfly made with Katie’s handprints, mummy was thrilled. Ben bought me a chocolate bar, which Katie and daddy ate most of again!</p><p>After church, Daddy went on a long walk with Katie to the swings, whilst Mummy and Ben played at home.</p><p>In the afternoon Mummy and Katie played face painting... you can see for yourself what happened.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_03_26-KatieFacePainting.jpg</src><caption>Face Painting</caption></image><p>Later on Farfar and Farmor came around to play and watch Man Utd play!

		<p>Today after preschool, Mummy, Katie and Ben went to meet Auntie Charlotte at Horton country park where we were scared by a crazy horse. It was in the field, bucking and neighing and galloping around, we were worried it would jump the fence and we had to run past the field at top speed, Katie and Ben were unfazed, surprisingly, Katie was fascinated. We also saw cows, sheep goats and pigs and got caught in a huge downpour. Poor Ben was soaked but as usual did not complain!</p>

The invitation said to wear your best party clothes and Katie looked absolutely beautiful in a lovely pink dress and she even let mummy put her hair in pigtails which is very rare. At the party there was a clown and some food and games. Katie won musical statues (how little miss fidget did this  we'll never know]. Mummy and Ben went to the parents coffee morning while the party was on. In the afternoon while Ben had a little nap, Katie and mummy were really naughty, and snuggled up and ate the Easter egg Katie had been given at the party, while we read books.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_03_31-09-PlayschoolParty.jpg</src><caption>Katie in her pretty dress</caption></image>

    <title>April Fool and Canal Bike Ride</title>
    <info>
		<p>Last night Ellie and Michael were hosting an evening around our house along with Karen and Richard, Jon and Rachel. It was a nice evening. Mummy and Daddy won Scene It. The others obviously do not have the film knowledge. All that can be said is Richard Burton and Wet, Wet, Wet!</p><p>When Katie woke up this morning mummy told her there was a spider on her head. Katie immediately felt her head and said there wasn't. April fool said mummy. From this point on everything was a tease. "Katie there's a lion in the garden" "Katie there’s a worm in your cornflakes" etc. Katie joined in teasing Ben, mummy and Daddy with the same teases or real ones, such as "mummy there's a picture on the wall, April fool". Then mummy concocted a plan to try and trick Ma Ma, as she always says nobody can April fool her. So Katie rang Ma Ma and Pop Pop and told them she had broken her arm after falling down the stairs, when they were shocked she said "April fool" Mummy couldn't believe how well Katie lied, Quite worrying really for when Katie's a teenager!</p><p>Ben hasn't been feeling very well. Not just teething, but maybe he has a chest infection. Everything that he's eaten has come back up again. Temperature and allsorts.</p><p>
        In the afternoon Daddy, Katie and Farmor ventured to Tring and attempted to cycle along the Aylesbury arm of the Grand Union canal. Of course under Daddy's leadership they got lost and took the wrong canal, went down the
        <a href="http://www.tring.gov.uk/info/guc.htm">
          Wendover
        </a>
        arm instead!! How can that be possible? We first of all cycled all the way to the end of the Wendover Arm. Doh! We then ventured along the roads to the picturesque village of Marsworth, passed a couple of horses which we waved at and after 30 minutes began where we were supposed to!

We saw plenty of ducks, swans, dogs and horses on our short route down towards Aylesbury. We only made it as far as Puttenham before Katie had enough. We ambled back to the source of the Wendover arm and returned to the car.</p>

    <title>Monument</title>
    <info>
		<p>No football and no church this morning. It must be a first. However, we are getting increasingly worried about Ben. Dry nappies, lack of food or drink, vomiting and a temperature. We stayed in and played.</p><p>
        In the afternoon we decided to go out and up to London, so we could sleep in the car on the way up. Destination was
        <a href="http://www.londontown.com/LondonInformation/Business/The_Monument/2c17/">
          Monument
        </a>
        . We arrived and parked pretty much outside. There are over 300 steps up which must have been heaven for Katie. She loves climbing stairs. We got to the top and the weather had turned for the worse which meant only Daddy was able to have a look at the views. Although there are quite a few buildings which are taller, you can still get some good views over the Thames and towards the city.
      </p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_04_02-30-Monument.jpg</src><caption>Mummy and Katie outside the monument</caption></image><p>We stopped off at a close Starbucks for a coffee and a cake to share. Katie let us have 2 bites each!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_04_02-38-Monument.jpg</src><caption>Katie Cup Cake</caption></image><p>We ploughed our way back, of course colliding with boat race traffic.</p>

    <first name="katie">Out of nappies</first>
    <info>
		<p>Katie wore 'big girl knickers' today and didn't wet them once. She asked to use the potty or toilet all day. We have been trying to get out of nappies since she was two so this is a very big achievement for Katie and will save Mummy and Daddy about £20 a month!</p>

    <title>National Stud</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        Mummy, Katie and Ben took Ma Ma to the<a href="http://www.nationalstud.co.uk/">National Stud</a>in Newmarket today for her Mother's Day present. We booked on for a tour, and Katie was very excited because it was on a bus, which she loves. We saw a one day old foal and some huge stallion racehorses, Katie was amazed, but mummy and Ma Ma thought that it was all quite cruel to the horses, mummy didn't realize what a stud farm was until we got there, she just thought it was going to be  racehorse stables, where they all live and you go to buy them or see them.
      </p><p>Newmarket town was nice, Ma Ma bought Katie an ironing board and mummy some clothes. We also had a lovely picnic.</p>

    <title>Greenwich Park and Mudchute Farm</title>
    <info>
		<p>We all stayed over at Ma Ma and Pop Pop's last night and woke rather early. 5:30!</p><p>
        We raced up to Greenwich and started at the top of the
        <a href="http://www.royalparks.gov.uk/parks/greenwich_park/">
          Greenwich Park
        </a>
        gates and entered the squirrel enclosure. We were accosted for a puppet show with a load of other kids. It was lovely to see. Katie was very quiet and attentive, even Benny was well behaved.
      </p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_04_08-28-GreenwichMudchute.jpg</src><caption>Greenwich Park</caption></image><p>It was a lovely sunny day and we walked around the flower section and down the steep hill to the huge playground at the bottom. Mummy and Katie were rushing around all the apparatus, whilst Daddy and Ben were rocking on the springy horse.</p><p>
        We continued our walk in to town and had a stressful time in the traditional<a href="http://www.pieshop.co.uk/">Goddard's Pie and Mash</a>cafe. Unfortunately you are on top of everyone and it is pretty frantic in there. Both Ben and Katie were both whining and crying so we didn't last as long as we hoped. Definitely recommend it for those without kids.
      </p><p>
        Next step was to reach<a href="http://www.mudchute.org">Mudchute Farm</a>, which is Europe's largest inner city farm. We passed the Cutty Sark and had races up and down the tunnel.... Daddy 2 V 0 Mummy. Yes!
      </p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_04_08-52-GreenwichMudchute.jpg</src><caption>Greenwich Tunnel</caption></image><p>The farm was in the middle of a tower block estate. We entered and weren't that impressed. We saw a load of ducks and a path which lead literally around the houses. Eventually we got to see some other animals. Mutant turkeys, which were huge, some goats, pigs (far far) and cows. We walked around the whole lot and prepared to make our way back, when we saw the stables area. This was fantastic. Loads of kids grooming about 30 horses. There was a lovely jovial, busy, sunny atmosphere. We watched some people having a horsey lesson which Daddy found interesting. Never knew there was so much to it. Personality of the horses... H and F positions for holding the reigns! Not sure what it all means. Anyway Katie was quite taken by the horses. Ben was asleep!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_04_08-44-GreenwichMudchute.jpg</src><caption>Mudchute Farm Stables</caption></image><p>We made the long walk pack to the top of the park, via an ice lolly stop en-route. Katie and Ben were knackered in the end.</p><p>Mummy and Daddy had their final race of the day. Daddy to go through London on his motorbike, versus Mummy going on the A2/M25/M3 in the car. Mummy won this one by about 10 minutes! Daddy only nearly died the once when he dropped his glove at the lights when they just turned green. Decided to wheel the bike to the side of the road and almost hit 2 motorbikes who were undertaking!</p><p>Daddy went out with Martin and Nick in the evening down in Basingstoke.</p>

    <title>Mother And Toddler Easter Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went to the Mother and Toddler Group Easter party today. Katie made a rabbit mask and took part in an Easter egg hunt, finding one for herself and one for Ben. Stupidly though mummy put them at the top of her bag and they must have fallen out because when we got home and went to eat them they had gone. In the afternoon we went and fed the ducks and had a go on the swings with Caroline and Henry. The ducks were completely uninterested in our bread as they must have been fed by every child in Frimley Green during the holidays. Katie had fun though, trying to throw her bread onto the ducks back which she found very funny.</p>

    <title>Visit The Gay's</title>
    <info>
		<p>Good Friday and we went over to Auntie Susan's and Graham's to swap eggs. Well we gave them 2 small eggs and we got 4 big eggs back! We walked down to the pond, but the ducks were not interested. We went to the playground and Benny Boo particularly loved the swings. You could tell he just wanted to go higher. Katie wanted to play with Bomber and Muriel, but they were pretty shy.</p><p>In the afternoon Mummy went to church, whilst the rest of us went to the Fars. After playing in the sofa house and farmyard we went for a walk to the aggressive Tomlins pond. Man the ducks were at each other and the swan kept chasing the Canadian Geese out of the water. It's the Basra of the pond world.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_04_14-14-Fars.jpg</src><caption>Starting our walk to Tomlins Pond</caption></image><p>Katie wanted the wee wee. No nappy, no toilet, no potty. It was quite funny really trying to get Katie to crouch down, seeing that she has never had to crouch before. Katie done well, Daddy got wet feet, but not a wet arm (which was used as a seat). We moved on to Alphington Pond where it seemed someone had released their goldfish some years ago.</p><p>We made our way back home and met up with Mummy again.</p><p>In the evening Daddy thrashed Far Far in a game of croquet!! 26-7</p>

    <title>Bermuda Triangle Of Animals</title>

		<p>Ellie led us to the Reptile Centre in the New Forest. We spent half an hour queuing to get there! We saw a frog, a snake and a newsletter inviting us back...erm no thanks.</p><p>We played over the secret bridge and had a picnic</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_04_15-19-NewForest.jpg</src><caption>The Gang</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_04_15-27-NewForest.jpg</src><caption>Michael, Katie and Joey</caption></image><p>
        We shifted up to the<a href="http://www.ottersandowls.co.uk/newforest.htm">Otter Sanctuary</a>close by which had a lot of otters, a fox, some owls and a very tame deer which you can go up to and stroke. He later nearly ate the pushchair! We saw the otters get fed. We liked the otters. A very nice day out

    <info>
		<p>Football was called off yet again, so after church we rushed over to Alton, for a nice Easter lunch and an egg hunt in the back garden. Funnily enough it seemed like Katie got the most. The afternoon ended with Mummy throwing a Cadbury's Cream Egg hitting and smashing Daddy's red wine glass that was in his hand! Red wine and glass over Daddy and the floor.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_04_16-26-Easter.jpg</src><caption>Elders back garden hunting for eggs</caption></image><p>After the clear up we went over to Great Grandma's and met up with the rest of the Barnett family. We strolled over to the park and played on the swings.</p>

Not our intended destination, but close enough. We had a nice walk along the river, next to the cows, up to Mapleduram lock.</p>

		<p>Katie was washing her hands in the bathroom, which woke Ben up from his afternoon sleep. Katie was worried about Ben waking early. Her conclusion was:</p><ul><li><i>katie</i>We need to buy some quiet taps from Bournemouth.
        </li><li><i>katie</i>You can get crisps and chocolate from Bournemouth to!
        </li></ul><p>Quiet taps so they don't wake Ben is a novel idea, but quite why Bournemouth was singled out, or even known about is quite a mystery.</p>

    <title>Scuba Diving plus Stocks and Shares</title>
    <info>
		<p>Yesterday Howard and Daddy went to the Scuba diving induction lesson where they given the course material and a subtle sales pitch on other courses, holidays and equipment. Needless to say Daddy bought a mask, snorkel, fins and boots for £112! That's on top of the £350 course fee. Still it'll be a good challenge and Daddy's looking forward to it.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_04_21-KatieScubaDiving.jpg</src><caption>Katie Scuba Diving</caption></image><p>Our responsible father of two has been investing the rainy day money in (high risk) shares!</p><ul><li><i>Tesco buy"&gt;16-06-2005 313p</i></li><li><i>Tesco sell"&gt;02-03-2005 335p ($437 profit)</i></li><p>Daddy sold because Tesco were pretty stagnant and there was a worry about the impending competition review in the summer. So we jumped ship and picked a high risk-ish mining company. The metal markets have been soaring recently, and Daddy thought it was time to get into the action.</p><li><i>Xstrata buy"&gt;07-03-2005 1705p</i></li></ul><p>Over the last 7 weeks they have risen to 2076p (18%).

		<p>After comments during the week about buying 'quiet taps' from Bournemouth, we thought we'd better go and investigate. We met up with Ma Ma, Pop Pop, Charlotte, Sue and Richard for a cup of coffee by the pier. We then took the beach train to Alum Chime and then walked back again along the sea front with Auntie Charlotte. Ben just loves being on Daddy's shoulders. He rocks from side to side and bellows his version of a laugh/sign of happiness.... which is a Bevis and Butthead type laugh!</p><p>We then had lunch in Winter Gardens and basked in the sunshine. The warmest day of the year so far. Katie and Mummy went to play on the beach, the sea was freezing, whilst Daddy introduced Ben to the surf shops of the town.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_04_22-15-Bournemouth.jpg</src><caption>Mummy, Daddy and Ben at Bournemouth</caption></image><p>We met up again.

    <title>Horton Country Park - Swimming - Ben 1st Crawl</title>
    <first name="ben">Crawled forward</first>
    <info>
		<p>After church we left Daddy behind and went to Horton Country Park. It was raining and we went for a walk and picnic! Mad.</p><p>We went for a little swim at Leatherhead swimming pool. Daddy tried his new mask on, and promptly got told to take it off by this girl. There was a high diving board which Daddy bravely went to try and dive from. Well it's got to hurt. A belly flop!! The same girl looked very disapprovingly at Daddy. A little later on, Daddy let Katie ride on his back as he swam under the water. However, he swam a little deep and Katie was submerged and struggling for air. Daddy didn't know, so Mummy had to step in, and Katie was a little upset.</p><p>The three of us have been trying to encourage Ben to crawl for weeks now as he has been so close. Late on in the evening he managed to slowly crawl half the length of the sitting room, and knock the cup tower over. Well done Ben. Just need to keep more of an eye on him now.</p>

    <title>Ben Swallows Sticker</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was a lovely sunny day and Katie, Benny and Mummy were in the garden. Ben was on a blanket with his toys and Katie and mummy were planting sunflower seeds in pots. Mummy had the brainwave of labelling the four pots with Katie’s letter stickers, putting a K, B, D, and M on each pot so we could see whose flower grows the tallest.</p><p>Stupidly, Mummy left the stickers on the grass and while Katie and Mummy were marvelling over two worms they found, Benny ate one of the stickers. Mummy turned round to see him chewing and ran to try and get it out. She could see it right at the back of his throat and tried to get it but couldn't. It went down his throat and must have got stuck because he started coughing and coughing and looked so worried and upset. Mummy panicked and called for an ambulance having visions of him going blue. While we waited mummy was really distraught and kept saying "where’s the flipping ambulance" when it did come Katie said "here comes the flipping ambulance." However Ben was fine by then but they took us to the hospital anyway and the Dr said he must have swallowed it down.</p><p>The next day Katie was fascinated when Mummy showed her the sticker in Ben's nappy still intact. She said "let’s do it again, let’s put another sticker in his mouth!" This is the second time mummy has been in A and E with Ben in a month. At the start of the month he had pussey tonsils and wouldn't take any fluids or food, worrying mummy silly. And the night he choked on the sticker mummy had to ring NHS direct as Ben was coughing and she was convinced it was still in his throat or in his lungs and the nurse told mummy to calm down. Mummy felt so guilty for leaving the stickers where Ben could get them.</p>

    <title>Nightmare Week</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mmmm.. where do I start.</p><ul><li><i>Monday</i>Car is kept overnight as Toyota mechanics have somehow disabled the car. Laura had managed to snap the key in the boot. Basically as they cannot get the key into the ignition to re-programme we are having to have a new unit costing $380!

        </li><li><i>Wednesday</i>Casuals lose 11-0 and I miss two penalties. Last ever Casuals game?
        </li><li><i>Thursday</i>Spend over a $100 on scuba diving gear when Daddy didn't really want to.
        </li><li><i>Friday</i>The end of a bad week for mining stocks. Eradicate $100's off portfolio value.

    <title>Lasham Airfield and NCT Sale</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy and Katie went out shopping to the Butchers, Bakers and Florists. It was nice to be us two and get some rare quality time together. Katie behaves so nicely when just either Mummy or Daddy is not around. We popped into the Fars on our way home.</p><p>
        In the afternoon we went to Alton and split up again.... The girls (along with Ellie) went to an NCT sale, whilst the four boys went up to Lasham to see the
        <a href="http://www.lasham.org.uk/">
          gliders
        </a>
        go up. The winch takeover seemed to take the gliders at a 45 degree angle. Looked pretty hairy. There were plenty of take offs and landings. We had to be careful when we crossed the airfield!!
      </p><p>We returned back to meet with the girls, then went down to the funfair which was setup on the green. Katie was enthusiastic to go on the inflatable, big slide. It was so funny to see her face change from joy to horror in about 2 seconds during her descent. Needless to say she didn't want any further go's.</p>

    <title>Farmor’s Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>Another Casuals game cancelled. The last of the season. Daddy really fears for the future of the club. There doesn't seem to be the passion or desire to play or even turn up from some members of the squad. Still all things must come to an end. Looking positively, an easier level of football may bring back the passion and desire again.</p><p>The rest of us went to church, then met up with Daddy at the Fars to celebrate Farmor’s birthday with a meal. Susan and Graham came as well and we had a Danish meatloaf. Mmmm. We went for a nice walk down to the pond and saw that there were some little ducklings. Arrr.</p><p>Later on, Daddy and Katie done some gardening. Katie is tendering after the sunflower seeds that were planted last week.</p>

    <title>Living Rainforest</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy stupidly invited Daddy to the weekly shop which pushed the final bill to over £100!</p><p>
        We tootled over to the<a href="http://www.livingrainforest.org/">Living Rainforest</a>which is near Newbury. It was a smaller setup than what we thought, but we all enjoyed going around the very humid greenhouses. We saw some monkeys which Ben absolutely loved following around. Katie said her favourite was a birdie which was roaming around the greenhouse. We don't know quite why she picked it out, as she was terrified of it. Anyway it was nice to see some animals in a different environment. Most of them were not behind bars and you had to be eagle eyed to spot them. A nice couple of hours spent there.
      </p><p>In the evening Daddy and Katie continued some gardening work. This time tidying the strip at the side of the house.</p>

    <title>Butlins Bognor - Karen Marks</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy went to Bognor with his friends for the weekend, so Mummy, Katie and Benny went to Ma Ma and Pop Pop's house with Auntie Ellie and Joey. We went Friday afternoon, stopping to see Auntie Karen and Summer first. It was a boiling hot day and we went to Woodlands park and played on the swings and had a really long ice pop which amazed Katie. Katie and Summer had a great time playing together.</p><p>The Butlins weekend for Daddy was good. 11 went: Daddy, Dawg, Michael, Barrie, Avez, Nick, Dave H, Steve H, Martin Bigg, James, Icey.</p><p>Memorable for:</p><ul><li><i>Bazza</i>Talking on the phone, thinking it was Emma, and not recognizing his own wife's voice!!

        </li><li><i>Dave H</i>Epic destruction of the toilet seat, toilet roll holder, falling asleep on the toilet for an hour at least

    <title>Trosley Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>Joey woke up at 05:45, waking Ben who then woke Katie, so it was a really early start (poor Ma Ma and Pop Pop!) Auntie Ellie and Mummy took Katie Ben and Joey to feed the ducks after breakfast leaving Ma Ma and Pop Pop to tidy up. It's amazing how messy the house gets with three small children. We all then met up in Gravesend and  Ma Ma bought Ben a 'Thomas the Tank Engine' ball and Katie a Barbie doll. We had a coffee and muffin in the shopping centre while we watched Katie and Joey on the slide.</p><p>After lunch Ma Ma made Pop Pop do the gardening but Katie loved helping, using a pair of scissors or (sizzles as Katie calls them) to prune a bush and helping Ma Ma sort out a bag of Auntie Ellie, Auntie Charlotte and Mummy's old garden toys, finding lots of interesting things to us all.</p><p>When Ben woke we went to Trosley country park for a walk and a go on the trim trail and then it was off to Auntie Helen's thirtieth birthday party. While we were there Ben scratched poor little Thomas' face and left a horrible red mark. Ben was probably trying to get his own back as normally its other children doing that to him, it’s not often he comes across somebody smaller than him.</p>

    <title>Auntie Christine's</title>
    <info>
		<p>We all went up to see Auntie Christine, Sarah and Kerry in Colchester. We had a lovely meal in a pub and Katie, Ben and Joey went in the Wacky Warehouse soft play. Afterwards we went back to Auntie Christine's house where Katie had us all in hysterics. Auntie Christine loves jokes and had lots of joke toys, one being a little box with a voice saying "help me I'm stuck in here, please get me out". Katie really believed that a little man was stuck in there and got upset when Pop Pop couldn't get him out, then she wanted us to take it to a policeman. There was also a 'voice changer machine' and Katie sang nursery rhymes in funny voices. There was a plastic man who pulled his trousers down when you pressed a button and a dancing flower Katie really loved it all.</p>

    <title>Wizzy World - Baz's 30th Meal</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy returned from Butlins exhausted. The rest of us came home from Ma Ma and Pop Pops and went to Wizzy World soft play with Daddy. We had a great time racing down the slide, Katie managed to win every time and we weren't letting her, she is very quick. Ben loved it too, now he is crawling he can really enjoy it and actually play on the equipment which was wonderful to see.</p><p>In the evening Mummy and Daddy went out with Barrie and Laura to celebrate Bazza's 30th birthday. We went for a nice meal at the Heron On The Lake, Fleet.</p>

    <title>Bazza 30th BBQ</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we took a long walk to Heatherside to get fresh bread, which Daddy is well into at the moment, and of course to play on the swings. Daddy bumped in to Jenny Finch who he hasn't seen for absolutely ages. She was in good form.</p><p>Later in the afternoon we scuttled over to Baz's where they laid on a good BBQ. It was also FA Cup Final day so the boys were watching the footie whilst the girls played.</p><p>James and us got Baz, 3x15 minute water skiing lessons at the Quays.</p>

    <title>Bournemouth with the Sanders</title>
    <info>
		<p>We met up with Auntie Karen and Richard in Bournemouth, at the pier, and spent the day with them. The weather was like a typical April day, blustery and cold.</p><p>However, this was not to deter us from hitting the beach and playing in the sand. Karen lead us into making a brilliant sand car that Ben and I could sit in and drive! It had seats in the back for grownups as well.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_05_20-24-Bournemouth.jpg</src><caption>Ben and Katie in sand car</caption></image><p>Ben squelched his hands and feet into the sand for the first time properly and didn't quite know what to make of it I think.</p><p>We took lunch in the overpriced Harry Ramsden's then Katie had a go on the trampolines which she loves to show off on. We then walked through Winter Gardens where there was the Elephant Festival. We sat had some ice cream and watched some Bangra dancing and a music act which had gymnastic type routines in it.</p><p>Time was running out but we wanted to treat Karen and Richard to their first Shakeaway milkshakes. Mmmm. As Katie would say 'D-E-L-ICIOUS.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_05_20-37-Bournemouth.jpg</src><caption>Shakeaway</caption></image><p>We drove straight to Ellie and Michaels where we played a bit and had a scrummy dinner. Ben was playing up and not taking a bottle, so after about 1.5 hours Mummy resorted to the boob. We don't say this many times about Ben, but he's a naughty boy!</p>

    <title>Chertsey Fives and Swimming</title>
    <info>
		<p>Farfar had organised a 5 a-side tournament at Chertsey which Daddy entered the Casuals team into. The squad was:-</p><ul><li>Daddy</li><li>Uncle Michael</li><li>Martin A</li><li>Steven B</li><li>Nick K</li><li>Richard S</li><li>David Weaver</li></ul><p>The weather was appalling, heavy showers. Farfar's job wasn't made easy with the weather, being let down with some help, being let down with some teams arriving late and not at all. Poor Farfar.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_05_21-08-ChertseyFives.jpg</src><caption>Casual Fives In Action</caption></image><p>Anyway we rotated who played so as to make it fair.</p><ul><li><i>played</i>1
        </li><li><i>won</i>0
        </li><li><i>draw</i>1
        </li><li><i>lost</i>3
        </li><li><i>for</i>1
        </li><li><i>against</i>8
        </li><li><i>points</i>1
        </li></ul><p>Needless to say we finished bottom of our group of 5. Pretty frustrating as we didn't play well. At least we got to see Daddy score Casuals one and only goal (from the centre kick)!</p><p>Mummy, Katie and Ben went swimming with Ma Ma, Pop Pop and Auntie Charlotte. Mummy took Joey down the flume and was really scared as it was faster than she remembered but Joey seemed to enjoy it. Ben was too small to go on and Katie has been totally put off flumes by Daddy taking her on one that was too fast and she could not be persuaded to go on. There is a little slide there which she loves though and she spent most of the time on that.</p><p>Katie also hates the wave machine much to Pop Pops annoyance as he first wanted to take her on the flume, then in the waves and she would have none of it, she didn’t mind the sweeties he bought her at the end though!</p>

    <title>Colchester Zoo</title>
    <info>
		<p>Despite the weather forecast, Mummy convinced us to go! However, we kind of got diverted from our course and it took 2.5 hours to get there.</p><p>The zoo itself was superb. It was almost built like a theme park with its fake rocks. Fortunately there were quite a bit of undercover bits. First up the orang-utans. We got very close to them. Just the width of the glass away. The rain got stronger so we went on the fairground ride, which Ben loved and Katie hated and had a short play in the soft play area.</p><p>We then saw the meercats being fed, penguins swimming under water, some piranhas and some parrots.</p><p>We went into the sea lion section, which had a large glass tunnel which we could go in and watch the sea lions swimming around us. This was superb and really caught Katie and Ben's attention.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_05_27-21-ColchesterZoo.jpg</src><caption>Sea lion Tunnel</caption></image><p>The rain persisted as we made our way to the Siberian tiger which was roaming around it's pen. Fantastic to see. We had to cross a really long rope bridge to see the lemurs which Katie loved. We also had a close look at the tigers. Amazing to get so close, amazing to see them moving around as well. So many places we've been to where they have been difficult to see or see them do anything.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_05_27-30-ColchesterZoo.jpg</src><caption>The 'Phants</caption></image><p>We headed towards the outside bits, where we saw a baby elephant stuck in a mud hole. The concerned parents came over to help push him out. They were loving the conditions. We also saw some rhino's, one of which was pushing a boulder, just like in 64 Zoo Lane. There was also a Zeedonk... half zebra, half donkey!</p><p>We again went inside and saw a small hippo, some leaf carrying ants, and the quickest tortoises you're likely to see. Daddy had a feeling they were on steroids, the way they were lapping their enclosure.</p><p>We then went to see the Amur Tigers (or 'orange' tigers as Katie called them) being fed and some spider monkeys who were quite active and came right up to the glass to have a closer look at us.</p><p>All in all the weather spoilt it a bit, but definitely would love to go back again on a sunny day. Probably the best zoo we've visited, topping the one down at Paignton.</p>

		<p>We tootled up to London after church and parked up near Claridges (near Bond St) and took a nice long walk through Oxford Street and up to Regents Park. It was quite a nice day and eventually navigated ourselves around to one of the busy playgrounds.</p><p>As it took us so long, as soon as we arrived we had to leave! Well Daddy jogged back with Ben in the pushchair. Ben absolutely loved it. Leaning forward, big smile, arm out sideways and fingers wiggling. We went back through Marylebone High Street which Daddy loved. Katie and Mummy had a great time in the busy playground.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Not having much money at the moment we wanted to do something free, so we borrowed the National Trust cards from Farfar and Farmor and drove to Petworth house.</p><p>We got there at 10:20 and it didn't open until 11:00 so we went round Petworth village and found a brilliant swing park which Katie and Ben loved. We had a doughnut and Katie had a gingerbread man. We then went to the house and first walked around the grounds and had our picnic.</p><p>There was a special thing for children where we had to find letters on posts and make up a word with a chocolate prize if completed. Katie loved walking around with her clip board finding the letters and she looked absolutely gorgeous doing it. The house was nice although the bedrooms were shut but we got to see the servants block which mummy always finds interesting.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_05_30-13-PetworthHouse.jpg</src><caption>Katie filling in quiz</caption></image><p>On the way home we stopped in Shalford village to see a National Trust watermill but it was shut so we went for a walk but gave up as Katie wanted to go in the pushchair or be carried by mummy and Ben didn't want to be carried he wanted to be on the ground. After about twenty minutes of carrying Katie, mummy’s arms were aching so much we turned around and came home.</p><p>Ben also managed to get himself halfway up the stairs this morning, unsupervised! Needless to say the stair gates are going up.</p>

    <title>Godalming Carnival</title>
    <first name="ben">Lots of goo-goo'ing and gar-gar'ing.</first>
    <info>
		<p>Ben is really developing quick. He can stand holding on to something and is progressing with his balance. He's attempting to speak with goo-goo'ing... and sometimes we think he's weighed in with the odd very garbled word which if you mangle it a bit turns into a 'Dadda' or something. He's also ever so playful. He initiates games of peek-a-boo, loves playing with doors, anything that Katie has and of course his pots and fridge magnets. He's braver than Katie when we went on a fairground ride. He has three sleeps: between 9am-11am, a short one in the afternoon and then goes down at about 7:15pm, wakes a couple of times during the night and is rocking and rolling between 6am and 7am.</p><p>He's a bit of a dude when it comes to music. He will sometimes start bopping his head like one of those Churchill dogs in backs of peoples cars. So cute.</p><p>Daddy went to watch football, so Mummy, Katie and Ben went to meet Oliver and Sarah in Godalming to watch the carnival. However when we got there mummy realised her phone wasn't charged and therefore could not get hold of Sarah to meet up. We watched the carnival procession, one float was squirting water at us which Katie and Ben loved as we were so hot. This is the first time Katie has seen a carnival and she loved waiting for it and watching the lorries and dancers and a great big pooh bear go past.</p><p>Silly Mummy forgot her purse as well so we couldn't have an ice-cream or a go on the bouncy castle, much to Katie's annoyance. We stopped on the way home though at Frimley Lodge Park and fed the ducks and went on the swings, which was lovely.</p><p>In the evening Joey and Uncle Michael and Auntie Charlotte came for a BBQ. Mummy was supposed to baby-sit Joey buy he was having none of it and wanted nobody but his daddy.</p><p>A little later the boys went off to play poker over at Uncle Stevens house. Nick won £100.</p>

    <title>England V Paraguay - World Cup</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was an early start as we were experiencing some really hot and sticky weather and the excitement of today's game made Daddy at least not able to sleep too well.</p><p>We had organised a BBQ, world cup party. The boys and some of the girls camped in the front room, curtains shut as we watched an initially exciting game.... especially as we went 1-0 up early doors.</p><p>However, the heat seemed to get to the players and the game wilted in the heat into a bit of a disappointing affair. Sven and his tactics are very strange. Just hope for better to come in the next games.</p><p>Bazza won the sweepstake and Daddy sparked the BBQ up.... which with the slight gas leak also sparked the wooden BBQ frame a light as well! Ooops. A few duck rolls later the BBQ was good to go with Dogs Costco burgers and our flavoured sausages.</p><p>The kids had turned the garden into a playground and the lawn was getting burnt to death. However, all seemed to enjoy themselves. The festivities ended with a world cup quiz game on the TV, which Chopper shone on.</p><p>Mummy, Ellie and Joyce stopped in for Big Brother, as Daddy, Michael and Steve went to Dave Weaver's 40th birthday bash. We turned up in shorts and t-shirt, everyone else was dressed smart!</p>

    <title>Playschool Picnic</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy, Katie and Benny met up with some of Katie's playschool friends and their mummy’s for a picnic in Frimley Lodge park. It was a lovely sunny day and after the picnic we played on the swings and all had a lolly.</p><p>It was nice for Katie to play with her friends outside of playschool and nice for mummy to meet some people and get more involved with Katie’s playschool. Last night mummy went to the committee meeting and volunteered for the job of wages and is now worried it’s going to be really difficult and be way above her head!</p>

    <title>Surprise Surprise - Paris</title>
    <info>
		<p>Finally after a few months planning we were off to France. However, Mummy thought we were going to Lille for 1 night, instead Daddy had planned Paris for four. It was Daddy's intention to see how long he could leave it before letting Mummy that we were not staying in Lille for 1 night.</p><p>We left Waterloo still not at our seats as Daddy got us on the wrong carriage. We finally bundled in our two seats for 4 people! The plan was that as we had kept Ben awake all this time that he was at least to go to sleep. Nope! Little Man didn't want any of it. Katie bored and Ben tired and not wanting to go to sleep made our journey a long one.... and for Daddy one spent in the luxury of by the toilets as to not upset any of the other passengers.</p><p>We quickly raced passed Gillingham bridge and soon entered the tunnel. Katie had kept re-iterating how she didn't want to go through the tunnel.... But it passed without much comment.</p><p>We soon arrived at Lille and Mummy still was none the wiser. We started to get off, then Daddy mentioned that he couldn't be bother and that we might as well stay on to Paris. Woo Hoo. Mummy was happy and sad. Obviously happy to be going to Paris. Sad to have to entertain us for another hour! At least Ben slept for part of this.... It was a shame as we didn't get much opportunity to see any of the countryside really.</p><p>The heat hit us as we stepped outside the air conditioned train. We eventually got our Paris Visite tickets (£40 for 5 days for 2 adults, Kids - Free) and lugged our luggage out of station, to find bus 31. It was quite comical Mummy taking us and seeing Daddy struggle getting 2 suitcases, a rucksack and the double buggy on and off the bus. It only took 10 minutes to get to the hotel which looked from the outside. It was the Hotel Eden, Montmartre.</p><p>We checked in and made our way up to the fifth floor in the smallest lift in the world (fits 4 people at a squash), into a small triple room. Saying that it had a nice bathroom, a great view from the balcony and the staff were helpful.</p><p>By now it was late afternoon, so we unpacked and made our way to Sacré Coeur. Daddy told Mummy that we were going to stay a little longer than 1 night, which Mummy was relived about. All this effort and all this way for just 24 hours in Paris! Non.</p><p>Sacré Coeur was some cathedral at the top of Monmartre Hill. Anyway that is what we thought. It was a really nice walk. As begun climbing the million or so steps some old German-French lady spoke to us.... Well Mummy anyway. She kept repeating herself like old people do. She was very sweet saying that. After about 10 minutes we managed to free ourselves to continue the climb. The views behind us were terrific. Katie loved climbing all those steps. She was in her element. Ben was just smiling at all the ladies. Daddy and Ben make a great team with the ladies. Ben pulls them, Daddy just looks and smiles.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_06_18-19-Montmartre.jpg</src><caption>Chatty old lady</caption></image><p>We hit the top and not only was there the impressive Sacré Coeur but a whole quaint village, although it was all for the benefit of tourists. Still we bought it and loved it. We walked around the cafes, bistros and outdoor restaurants. We entered the Cathedral, circled it and promptly got out as there was a service in progress! The view on the other side of the church were even better. We could see Paris, although none of the famous landmarks.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_06_18-22-Montmartre.jpg</src><caption>Chatty old lady</caption></image><p>There was a funicular down the other side of the hill to a little play area for us. For some reason we were not interested in the carrousel which was a shame. Next mission was to get some dinner. We eventually found a cafe-restaurant where we had an Italian meal. Great come to France to get Italian. Time was really marching on and it was well passed our bedtime.... We retraced our steps and within about half an hour we were back in the hotel, getting showered and being naughty and not sleeping! The room was très chaud!</p><p>Daddy popped off to the traditional French bar next door and watched The French draw 1-1 with South Korea. Beer was twice as expensive as in England, but the atmosphere and hospitality, down to the small bowl of crisps was twice as good.</p>

    <title>Zoo - Notre Damm</title>
    <info>
		<p>We got up normal time, embarrassingly had breakfast with a naughty Katie and headed on the metro to the Zoo. On the way Daddy had lost the wallet. Panic set in for about a minute when the guard came running down the stair to find me! Phew.</p><p>The metro at 9am on a Monday morning going into the city was surprisingly quiet. Also the Parisians need to be introduced to escalators in their underground system! Not fun carrying the double buggy around.</p><p>Daddy also boobed when we got off the train. He went through the automatic gates to drop the bag and Ben off and then couldn't go back to get the pushchair. Eventually he worked out where the motion sensors were and climbed-jumped over to get the pushchair.</p><p>The zoo was a small stroll away, slightly out of the city. We could see the man made mountain a long way away and we were getting excited as to what we were going to encounter.</p><p>It cost just £6 for us all to get in..... Absolute bargain. Tight Daddy almost fell over in amazement to how cheap it was. However, there was a reason to the cheapness! There were hardly any bloody animal there!</p><p>The place reminded us of London Zoo. Old 60's style under a lot of renovation work because of it. And because of it there were no animals. we couldn't even go up the mountain to see the views. It was quite depressing really, especially as the animals that were there didn't seemed to be kept to English high standards! There were some goats stuck half way up a mountain!! (because they were mountain goats)... Seriously the one and only huge Sea Lion had funny teeth and was on his own. One seal just wouldn't get up even though it was feeding time.... It was like the Rab C Nesbitt of the seal world. The penguins had their water moat drained... and the hippo was just showing us his bottom (reminded me of Dawg) as he was munching his grass</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_06_19-20-NotreDam.jpg</src><caption>Chatty old lady</caption></image><p>We departed within 2 hours and headed to the nearby park to eat our lunch. Katie needed the toilet, so Daddy helped squat her by a tree. Daddy's arm and leg got wet! Having to think what to do next, Mummy and Daddy thought of going to see the Notre Damm.</p><p>Taking the metro we all got in except for Daddy who had to take another carriage because of the buggy. We sailed off, leaving Daddy standing. Now it is one of those situations: Do we get off next stop, Do we get off and go back, or do we just go to where Daddy said we needed to go. We took the last of those options, and thankfully we met up again at Strasbourg St Denis. That was a bit of luck as Daddy had all the bags, money and tickets. This was doubly important as Ben Hiroshima’ed.</p><p>Daddy took Ben into McDonalds to get his nappy changed. However, there was no baby change facility which made things very tricky for the useless Daddy. Anyway when they came out, fair enough Ben nappy was changed, but he still had poo on his trousers and poo all over Daddy's t-shirt! Pooo-ey. Katie really didn't want to be near Daddy now.</p><p>We decided to walk from here down to 'City'. Daddy's nightmare day continued as he led us all down what seemed the fat lady’s, red light district. If you liked them fat or old then this street was for you. It was an eye opener for Mummy and Daddy, we were oblivious to what was going on. We walked and walked until we found a map and we weren't quite going in the direction we hoped. We entered the pedestrianized, shopping area and eventually a park with a children’s garden and men playing boules.</p><p>We crossed the Seine, Katie had an ice cream, Daddy pointed out the Eiffel Tower to mummy, who claimed 'I wasn't expecting it to look like that. I thought it was a gold building!!'.... I know it beggars beyond belief at the lack of knowledge mummy has! Anyway we finally hit the Notre Damm. We piled inside with the hundreds of others. Farfar can't go inside because he has a 'thing' about tall ceilings... Well you can't argue against that. It was very high up. We done a lap and was amazed at all the stained glass windows. We tried to go up on to the roof but the queue for that was far too long.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_06_19-23-NotreDam.jpg</src><caption>Chatty old lady</caption></image><p>So we decided to eat. Mummy insisted that Katie would only eat chips. Daddy refused to accept that and ate a baguette thingy and Mummy and Katie had a McDonalds!</p><p>We caught the Metro from Chatelet and walked back to the Hotel. Katie was shattered. Mummy got her showered and bed, whilst Daddy fed Ben, then went on an hour long walk around Montmartre again! It really is a nice area of Paris. Glad we are staying here.</p>

    <title>Eiffel Tower - Sewer Museum - Moulin Rouge</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today we decided to see a bit more of the city and took the bus to just the other side of the Seine. There were tons of police around and they had shut the road. The art museum, Musee du Quai Branly was opened by President Jacques Chirac and Kofi Annan. Anyway it didn't really interest us and we brisked passed on to Tour De Eiffel.</p><p>We didn't quite know what to do with the pushchair so decided just to dump it under the tower. At this time of the morning there were not that many people about. We went to the cleanest toilets in Paris as Benny the pooing machine had again filled his nappy. We queued in the longest queue and paid to go up in the lifts, then found where you can walk up the first two levels.</p><p>Daddy walked up the first two flights, with Ben on his shoulders. You could see quite a lot of Paris from here. Katie spotted some carrousel’s which we had to keep looking out for at each level we reached. The views were great views across the city. You could see the Sacré Coeur, Arc Du Triomphe. Miles and miles. Some classic Mummy comments on the Eiffel Tower:</p><ul><li><i>Mummy comment</i>Earlier confused Eiffel Tower with a lamppost!
        </li><li><i>Mummy comment</i>Thought the structure was a golden colour!
        </li><li><i>Mummy comment</i>She argued that it was taller than the Empire State Building. Just to prove Daddy is right (as always):-
          <i>
            It held the title of tallest building in the world until 1931, when New York City built the Empire State Building. Source:<smallcaps>http://www.etrav.com/pathways/html/eiffeltower.asp</smallcaps></i></li><li><i>Mummy comment</i>The tower we could see was the Telecom tower in London!!!
        </li></ul><p>We queued to go up in the lift from the second level. As the lift rose, Mummy and Daddy's knees began to wobble a bit. It wasn't a pleasant journey as the structure thinned out towards the top. The lifts don't go up vertically, they are at a slight angel due to the  shape of the tower. We finally hit the top and looked around in the inside gallery. Then we climbed some more steps and went to the outside viewing gallery. Mummy and Daddy were a bit uncomfortable especially when Katie was leaning against the railings. Still you could see even more from up here. We didn't spend long up there and got the lift back to level 2 and walked down all the steps to the bottom.</p><p>We went to look for the pushchair and noticed it had gone! Oh dear. The police had removed it, so Daddy went to get it! Woops. We know nobody would have stolen it. It was in such a state. Food stains all over it.</p><p>We went to the nearby play ground, then had our picnic in the park next to the Eiffel Tower. We were constantly hassled by these so called Bosnian girls who were basically begging. In the end we had to tell them to go away, almost pinching the yoghurt we were feeding Ben with out of our hands. They were clean and had clean clothes on so I wasn't falling for it. Come to think of it, there were quite a lot of beggars throughout our holiday. So you could see were genuinely homeless, most were con-artists.</p><p>Katie wanted to go on the carrousel’s that we saw from the tower. So we had a go on 2 of them! Even Benny Boo had a go. We walked to the Trocadero and got some pictures of us in front of the Eiffel Tower.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_06_20-44-EiffelTower.jpg</src><caption>Eiffel Tower</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_06_20-40-EiffelTower.jpg</src><caption>On the carrousel</caption></image><p>
        We walked eastwards back along the Seine to Place De La Resistance (just had to write that as that is Del Boy sating I think). Anyway there was the sewer museum there (
        <a href="http://europeforvisitors.com/paris/articles/paris-sewers-museum.htm">
          Le Musee des Egouts
        </a>
        ). We got down there and Katie took some water from the bottle and was told she wasn't allowed to drink it for risk of the bacteria attacking it! Comforting to know! Anyway we walked through the tunnels and saw the sewage gushing past. Mummy thought it smelt bad. Daddy didn't mind it. We walked around in about half an hour and rose to some fresh air.
      </p><p>Continuing eastwards we saw the impressive Musee de l'Armee building by Invalides.</p><p>Next northwards on the Metro to Moulin Rouge. Not that impressed with it, especially as it seemed to be in a bit of a seedy area. We had a quick peek inside the reception area, then took a long walk back to the hotel over Monmartre hill</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_06_20-48-EiffelTower.jpg</src><caption>Moulin Rouge</caption></image><p>We cleaned ourselves up at the hotel and bussed it to Place De Clichy where we had earlier seen the Hippo restaurant. We try to keep it cheap, as we were on a budge. Daddy decided not to eat, and we thought that Katie's meal wouldn't come with chips. Alas, Mummy's burger was well done, but not well done enough so Daddy had to eat it (which turned out to be a Horse burger anyway), and Mummy went without. Katie's meal turned up with a large plate of chips. Ben on the other hand was impressing one of the young lady waitresses. Impressed so much she wrote her name and phone number on a bit of card and gave it to her! Good work Benny boy. A chip off the old block. Let the ladies do the chasing. It all ended embarrassingly as the other waitresses laughed at how little money was spent.</p><p>We crawled into bed quite late in the end. Mummy and Daddy stayed up to watch England draw disappointingly with Sweden 2-2, with the sound muted!... and Mummy muted!</p>

    <title>Concorde, Tuiles Jardin, Louvre, Champs-Élysées, Arc De Triomphe, Bastille, Place D'Italie</title>
    <info>
		<p>After breakfast we Metro'ed it to Place De La Concorde. It was pretty hot. We first headed through Jardin Du Tuileries, got wet on the fountain spray and on to the Louvre. We circled the glass Pyramide. We did think that it looked out of place with the fine buildings around it.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_06_21-46-LouvreArcTriomphe.jpg</src><caption>Louvre</caption></image><p>We turned and headed back passed Concorde up the Champs-Élysées. There were plenty of the top shops either side. The weather got decidedly chilly as we neared the top of the hill and the Arc De Triomphe. The traffic was fairly busy and we travelled the underpass to the middle of the large Marble Arch! We could see all the way back to Place De La Concorde. The Eiffel tower wasn't that far away either,</p><p>We had a lovely lunch again..... well again Mummy ordered a burger and then didn't eat it!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_06_21-58-LouvreArcTriomphe.jpg</src><caption>Arc Du Triomphe</caption></image><p>We headed back to the hotel to get some warmer clothes, then headed to the East of the city towards Bastille.</p><p>From the Bastille we took the pretty viaduct garden path to Jardine De Reuilly where Katie and Ben played in the playground. Worrying about Katie eating junk food and trying to find somewhere that would serve some pasta we decided to catch the metro to Place De Italie. However, the girls had to give up and eventually had a McDonalds again!!! Daddy wasn't pleased.</p><p>We headed home for another late night.</p>

    <title>Swimming Nightmare - Back Home</title>
    <info>
		<p>Swimming was order of the day. We headed to the south-west part of the city on the Metro and attempted to go in the Aquaboulevard. It boasted loads of slides, a huge replica whale, outdoor areas, sun loungers, basically a place where you could spend the whole day. Trouble is we only had half a day. The cost was 25 Euros an adult! We would have reluctantly gone in, but our hand was forced when they said they wouldn't admit under 3's!</p><p>So we got back in the Metro headed to Place De Italie again this time to buy Daddy some Speedo style swimming trunks. Mmmm. Cheapest we could find.</p><p>We went to Reuilly swimming pool which we had seen the day before..... What we hadn't seen is the notice to say as from today that it was closed for renovation work!! Arrgghh. So Daddy with his Del Boy French managed to ask a non-English speaking local where the nearest swimming pool was. Mummy got the directions all wrong. She muddled ‘Tout Droit’ with ‘A Droit’. Anyway the route took us an extra mile or so along the viaduct garden route all the way to where the ring road circles Paris! By this stage we were a little demoralized at all of the travelling to find a sodding swimming pool.</p><p>
        We arrived to find that this was an<a href="http://www.cnparis.net/">outdoor pool</a>for professional swimmers !! Still after our hot dog lunch, Katie and Daddy ventured in. The pool was laned off with 40 or so people go up and down, up and down. We phaffed around to find swimming caps and eventually made it in to the warm pool. Katie loved in there and we managed to do 2 lengths without out too much help. Daddy is a bit worried about Katie's lack of swimming skills so he always barks out kick, kick, kick and arms out like a butterfly. We're not sure if she has got it yet.
      </p><p>We were in there for 45 minutes and got out at 1pm. We were now in a rush to get to the train station in time.... We also had to cross Paris to the hotel in order to get our suitcases. In the end Daddy rushed back to the hotel, whilst the rest of us went to check in at Gard Du Nord. We re-united with Daddy in the departure lounge, when Mummy had realized that she had left the rucksack with the metal detector people.... Anyway passports were taken as the second potential security incident occurred (1st when we left pushchair under the Eiffel Tower unattended for an hour or so).</p><p>The train journey home was a sad one as we had really enjoyed our holiday. Again we only had 2 seats for the four of us.</p><p>In the train Mummy was hungry and wanted to know if she could eat a bit of Katie:</p><ul><li><i>Mummy</i>Can I eat one of your arms. You only need one.
        </li><li><i>Katie</i>No I need my arms
        </li><li><i>Mummy</i>Can I have one of your ears?
        </li><li><i>Katie</i>No I need I need my ears to hear
        </li><li><i>Mummy</i>Can I eat your nose?
        </li><li><i>Katie</i>No I need my nose
        </li><li><i>Mummy</i>Why do you need your nose?
        </li><li><i>Mummy</i>For picking!!
        </li></ul><p>We made it back on time in to Waterloo where we got a train back to Woking where Farmor and Farfar came to pick us up. We were tired out with the travelling and slept very quickly. Later on the Fars brought around some Fish and Chips for us.</p>

		<p>Mummy, Katie, Auntie Charlotte, Auntie Ellie and Joey went over to California Country Park for a picnic today. The weather was absolutely boiling but there was lots of shade. Auntie Charlotte brought lots of lovely food and then we went for a walk round the lake and fed the ducks. Unfortunately the swimming pool bit was shut so we could not swim which would have been lovely to cool down but we had an ice lolly and a play on the swings and the indoor play area.</p>

		<p>Katie and Mummy were taking part on the Pre-school float for the Frimley Green carnival. They dressed up as princesses!</p><p>In the morning Mummy went to help dress the float. The weather was a bit dodgy but come the afternoon it brightened up.</p><p>We went around to the Fars for a rushed, but lovely lunch. Auntie Susan and Graham, along with the Fars, Ma Ma, Ellie, John Garratt and Grandma and Granddad all came to line the busy streets. The procession commenced from Balmoral Drive and wound its way down to the Green and up to Lakeside.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_07_09-18-FrimleyGreenCarnival.jpg</src><caption>Princess Mummy and Katie</caption></image><p>There must have been about 40 kids on the float all dressed as princes and princesses. They all looked beautiful. When Katie saw us she beamed a huge smile. She was so happy.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_07_09-21-FrimleyGreenCarnival.jpg</src><caption>The Float</caption></image><p>We then made our way to a very busy and loud green to look at the stalls and watch the entertainment in the middle. We couldn't quite believe the huge number of people that were there and that had lined the streets. It was very nice to see.</p>

    <title>Bocketts Farm with Playschool</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today we went to Bocketts Farm with Katie's preschool and had an excellent day. It was lovely and hot and all of Katie's friends were there. Ben really loved the animals, especially the sheep until one baaed so loudly and really upset him! We went on a tractor ride and saw pig racing. The play area was fantastic. Katie went on the trampoline and slides and playhouses while Ben was in his element because there were lots of tunnels to crawl in which he can’t get enough at the moment. There was a great bouncy pillow as well like a giant bouncy bed which all the children loved. We all met for a picnic and an ice cream and at the end of the day Katie went on an electric tractor and was really good, steering it all around the track better than mummy could have, I think. We stayed a bit later than most to go in the soft play bit and we had great fun as Ben can do everything in there, there is no sand or bark chippings to eat either which is what normally happens in the outdoor parks!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_07_14-33-BockettsFarms.jpg</src><caption>Farrrrmer Katie</caption></image>

    <title>Brighton Beach</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today was really hot and sunny. As we haven't been out just us 4 for a while we decided to go down to the seaside and have some fun. We parked up in Portslade and walked along the promenade towards Brighton.</p><p>We stopped off for a picnic lunch along the way on the beach. Ben was more interested in eating the pebbles off the beach than his proper lunch! We tried to get into the sea a little bit. Ben didn't enjoyed it. I think the waves and the splash was too much for him.</p><p>We continued along until we hit the paddling pool just by the West Pier. It was packed but Katie and Ben both loved playing in the water and of course all the ancillary play stuff.</p><p>We moved on past the vibrant bars and entertainment which was happening along to the pier. A great fan of Bournemouth we may be, but Brighton has certainly got a better pier (which is free!). We stuck our faces through the funny board...</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_07_15-34-Brighton.jpg</src><caption>Pier Entertainment</caption></image><p>... and managed to play with Noddy. Katie had a go on a couple of the carousel rides. There are so many new attraction there now. The log flume being the latest. Katie looked kind of anxious at that one!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_07_15-35-Brighton.jpg</src><caption>Ben making friends wit Noddy</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_07_15-47a-Brighton.jpg</src><caption>On Brighton Pier</caption></image><p>Time really did fly past and it was getting a bit late to return by foot. So instead we caught a bus back. Katie I think gave the bus a running commentary from the front of the top deck of what we saw. She was little Miss Chatterbox.</p><p>We returned home to Fish and Chip supper, and a phone call to find where we were as we were supposed to be babysitting Joey! Woops. We had a great day out.</p>

    <title>Natasha's Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie's friend Natasha (from playschool) was 3 today and celebrated by having her birthday party at Fizzy Kids with about a dozen of her playschool friends.</p><p>Katie loved it..... and was over excited with her friend Robert. They ran all over the place and played together nicely. Katie seems quite popular with her playschool friends which gives a nice warm feeling inside. The girl is growing up and has made friends without Mummy and Daddy forcing her.</p><p>Ben liked playing in the bubble car which Daddy raced him around in. The session ended with a party meal. All the traditional chocolate biscuits, jam tarts, sandwiches and cake were all there. The 1.5 hours flew by.</p><p>In the hot afternoon when went for a short walk up Old Guildford Road. It's a long bumpy track which we've never got to the end of before now. It was a relaxing end to the weekend.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Daddy was scuba diving, so Mummy Katie and Ben went to Greenwich Park with Pop Pop. We saw the deer and Katie tried unsuccessfully to stroke a  few squirrels. We fed the ducks, had a lovely picnic and went on the pedalos. Katie loved dipping her hand in the water and Benny crawled all over the boat, very fidgety. Then we went on the swings buy unfortunately somebody kicked a ball at Katie and she fell over and was so upset. Pop Pop cheered her up by buying us all a lolly. We went under the Thames in the tunnel, Katie loved the steps but when we came up it was pouring with rain, so we went back and walked through the market, Mummy bought Katie some sweeties in an old fashioned sweet shop.</p>

		<p>Daddy was scuba diving again so Mummy, Katie and Ben had a lovely day together at home. We went to church first and then while Ben slept, Mummy and Katie blew up Katie's new bouncy castle and paddling pool that was an early birthday present from Ma Ma and Pop Pop. It took ages, we also went through Katie's wardrobe and threw out lots of old clothes and put new ones in, Katie loved doing this. Ben then woke up and hated the noise of the electric pump blowing up the castle so Mummy had to cuddle him and try to set the castle up. Ben and Katie loved the castle once it was up although Katie was a little boisterous and Knocked Ben a couple of times while attempting roly polleys. We then went to Oliver’s house for a little birthday party which was lovely.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_07_23-55-ScubaHorseaIs.jpg</src><caption>The Scuba Crew</caption></image>

    <info>
		<p>Katie woke up at 6:30 (Mummy had been awake for ages, so excited about giving Katie her bike), and opened her presents in Mummy and Daddy's bed. She opened her new pink bike and loved it and wanted to go out and ride it there and then. We met Auntie Ellie and Joey to do the weeks shopping and get last minute food for the party. Great Grandma and Great Granddad came over with loads of presents, including a bell and water bottle for the bike, which mummy attached. Then we went for a ride on Katie's new bike and she was a natural, so good at it, with her little helmet she looked gorgeous.  Then at 15:30 Katie’s friends arrived for the party. Ma Ma and Pop Pop had bought Katie and Ben a bouncy castle and paddling pool and the children loved it. Oliver, Henry, Joey, Joshua, Poppy, James Natasha, Ella and Freya. We played pass the parcel, had tea complete with jelly and ice cream and then Katie blew out the candles on her Fifi Flower Tot cake, that Mummy had bought as she is a disaster at cakes. Farfar and Farmor and Auntie Susan came over later with more presents, and Uncle Howard and Susie.</p>

    <title>Hayling Island Disaster Day</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today we went to meet Auntie Lindy and Ella at Hayling Island and it was one problem after another. First Mummy got the time of Katie's doctor’s appointment wrong so we missed it, then we got stuck in traffic (taking two hours to get there), then we couldn't find Auntie Lindy, then Mummy couldn't find a cash point and didn't have any money for parking and then her shoes got washed away in the sea while we were paddling. Mummy had to spend the rest of the day walking around the fair ground in bare feet. Katie went on two rides, Ella had no fear and went on everything she could and Ben went on his first carousel ride and was terrified. Mummy got so upset as she could just see his little head poking out of the car with tears down his face. She asked the man to stop it but he said it was near the end and she had to wait, it was horrible. We had an ice lolly and came home.</p>

    <title>Horsham and Baynards Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>Another hot and sunny day and we decided to go off to Horsham and try out the Pavilion swimming pool which Ellie and Michael recommended to us. It was fantastic. Just right for Katie and Ben. They had 3 separate pools all reasonably shallow. One of the pools had an exit outside to the rapid river area. Ben is still not 100% comfortable with the water just yet. He looks so shocked when water splashes his face, even though he's used it in the bath. Katie on the other hand just loves playing and jumping in off the sides. She doesn't ever fancy learning or trying to swim that much, I assume that's seen as too boring. Katie Nemo and Daddy Nemo played lots together and we could have stayed in there for a lot longer.</p><p>After the swim we went and played on the very modern and large playground just outside the swimming pool. However, we were hungry and were desperate for our lunch so we tootled off for part 2 of our day.</p><p>We drove to just outside Horsham to a small village called Baynards. We found a nice village green type place to stop and eat. Locals must of wondered what on earth was going on.... just like we would think if someone came to stop and eat a picnic on Frimley Green! We treated ourselves to using the picnic hamper, mainly to impress Katie, but she didn't seem that bothered by it.</p><p>Now mid-afternoon we went to search for the start of our 4.25 mile walk which we got out of our book (Thanks Steven and Joyce). We wondered if we were ever going to finish in time. Still we marched on along a disused railway line, through lots of stiles, which is not easy with a double buggy, some woods and some farmers fields, some of which were populated with cows, much to the annoyance of Katie and Mummy (who are scared off them). On one occasion the cows started to approach us Mummy ran off, leaving Daddy and Katie with the pushchair. Gee thanks Mum. Daddy then started to approach the cows in return, waved his arms and made very loud moo noises. Not sure who was most scared the cows or the rest of us!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_07_29-07-BaynardsWalk.jpg</src><caption>Where are we going?</caption></image><p>After only getting lost a couple of times we finally made it back to the car and raced home! A lovely day out just the four of us!</p><p>One thing we have really noticed this weekend is that Ben seems to laugh at a lot of things without us having to try and make him laugh. We go along sometimes and we just here this chuckle in the back. We haven't got a clue what he is laughing at. He's a real boy. He loves airplanes, tractors and to do lots of poo's.</p>

    <title>Canford Cliffs</title>
    <info>
		<p>After a turbulent morning we decided to go off to Dorset. Originally we were to go to Lullworth Cove, but as we were skirting around Bournemouth at midday, we thought it was getting a bit late to make the longer journey, so we decamped a mile or two to the west of Bournemouth at a place called Canford Cliffs.</p><p>Still with the sandy beaches, but with much less people. The sand was so soft, it felt like walking on flour. Again we had our picnic on the beach. It didn't seem the warmest of days as it was pretty blustery and cloudy. However, mummy and Katie were first to brave the sea. Katie didn't want to be left to her our devices, she needed Mummy to hold her. Ben didn't even like standing in the water. That was a definite no, no. Daddy and Ben were making pits in the sand. At least this time Ben has seemed to learn not to eat the sand all the time.</p><p>We all went for a nice walk along the water’s edge and back along the promenade, of course to get Katie an ice cream. We had a really nice time again and dreamed of one day owning one of the beach huts.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_07_30-07-CanfordCliffs.jpg</src><caption>Enjoying the sandy beach</caption></image>

    <title>Henry's Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>We met Ma Ma and Auntie Charlotte at the Star Pub for a drink, then we drove in convoy to Horton Country Park where we had a lovely picnic (Ma Ma had brought Katie chocolate cornflake cakes, her favourite).</p><p>Next, we went for a walk and saw the horses and some of the other farm animals, which Ben really enjoyed. We found a really good swing park and then went and had an ice-lolly. After that we drove to Henry's for his birthday tea party. Katie was the only girl amongst eight boys!</p>

    <title>Ben's 1st Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was Ben's first birthday. As is customary we all piled into Mummy and Daddy's bed and helped Ben open his presents. What a lot of toys he got. Mummy and Daddy got a big yellow truck which Ben loved to climb into!</p><p>In the afternoon we had some family and friends over for a Benny Boo BBQ party. It was pretty manic, but very enjoyable. Katie thought it was her birthday with all the presents. The children played in the big paddling pool, and the adults played games like Musical Islands and Pass The Parcel! The party ended with birthday cake and 'goody bags'.</p><p>Thank you everyone for their presents.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_08_03-02-KatieNurse.jpg</src><caption>Junior Nurse Gay</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_08_05-05-BenBday.jpg</src><caption>Birthday and his truck</caption></image>

    <title>Summer's 2nd Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>After church we went over to Gravesend for Summer's 2nd birthday which was in her back garden. There were loads of goodies, but by far the favourite for Katie and Ben was the colourful Wendy House.</p><p>Karen and Bradley's next door neighbours who are foster parents were there. They had just received a pair of twin boys who were born at 1 pound each to a 14 year old girl who gave them up straight away. They were very active, but remedial 3 year olds. I just think what special people they are to take on someone else’s kids and care for them so well. I can only admire them and wish them luck.</p><p>We enjoyed chasing after the kids for a few hours, it was so hot.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_08_06-10-SummersBday.jpg</src><caption>Katie Attitude</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_08_06-16-SummersBday.jpg</src><caption>Ben</caption></image>

    <title>Oh Dear Farfar - Holmsly Camping Holiday</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy went to pick Farfar up this morning, 25 minutes before his train leaves. He arrived and Farfar was still in pants and socks..... TV on from the night before (as he fell asleep in front of the tele) and suitcase still to be packed!!! Daddy asks what he can do to help and wants Daddy to address an envelope for some football club errand!!!!!! Can he be any worse? Anyway, fortunately the train was late, so he got to Gatwick in time.</p><p>We set off early for our holiday to the New Forest. Girls only (except for Joey and Benny and possibly Toby too). We all met at Winchester service station for a coffee and a go on the swings. Ma Ma bought Katie and Joey a frog deck chair each, ready for our camp fires! We got to the campsite, it was packed and it took a while to find a nice spot. We put the tents up in about an hour. While Mummy, Auntie Charlotte and Auntie Ellie put the tents up Ma Ma took Katie for a ride on her scooter and they found a blackberry bush and for the rest of the holiday Katie became obsessed with riding her scooter round the berry bush. Katie has actually become very good on her scooter and whizzed around really fast loving it. We then went off to Lymington for lunch. We ate baguettes by the harbour but there wasn't much to do, so we left and found a nice beach to sit on. From there we bought fish and chips and ate them outside the tent. We all went for a shower which Benny hated and sobbed his eyes out. Then we all cuddled up in the tent and had a surprisingly good night’s sleep!</p>

    <info>
		<p>
        We went to the<a href="http://www.dorset-heavy-horse-centre.co.uk/">Heavy Horse Centre</a>today. It was great that Katie had a go in a little cart pulled by a Shetland pony much to the surprise of us all. She also went in their stable and groomed them with brushes and so did Benny which he enjoyed, but I'm not sure if the horse did. Ma Ma, Katie, Ben, Joey and Auntie Ellie also went in a cart pulled by a Shire horse. Mummy enjoyed looking around the Romany caravan that was there. We then went back to the tent and had a lovely BBQ with Uncle Howard, Uncle Richard and Auntie Sue, and had another good night’s sleep all snuggled up.

    <info>
		<p>
        We met Lynne and Rachel at some<a href="http://www.lymington.biz/whattodo/everton.asp">water gardens</a>which were nice but quite small, so went on to a nice beach and had lunch and a paddle. Katie assured us that she had seen a swing park as we drove into the car park, none of us believed her but we humoured her and went to where she said and sure enough there was a fantastic park all grassy which was great for Ben. We went back to the campsite for a walk to see the New Forest ponies and for tea. Not such a good night’s sleep, Benny was quite unsettled.

    <title>Camping Holiday - Bournemouth</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went to Bournemouth today. We parked at Canford Cliffs and had lunch on the beach and a play in the sand. Mummy, Katie and Auntie Charlotte braved the cold sea right up to our shoulders, which Katie loved and wouldn't let us get out. Then Joey and Ben slept in the double buggy and Katie in the single one and we walked all the way to Bournemouth. Katie had a go on the trampolines and Katie and Joey went on the Carousel. We had our daily ice cream and caught the land train back to Durly Chime where we had tea in a pub and walked the long way back with both Katie and Ben tired and wanting Mummy to cuddle them all the way! Not a very good night’s sleep, Benny must have kept the whole campsite awake! I think it was getting more uncomfortable as the duvets were very flat from sleeping on them so much.</p>

    <title>Denmark Holiday - Airport Fun and Roundtower</title>
    <info>
		<p>Currently there is a high state of security surrounding airplane flights from London and today the queues were long at 6am! We had to skip the queue at check-in, and where you go through the metal detector. Even Katie got frisked, although Ben did not. I supposed it gives some sort of comfort that there are stringent checks. Overall we were just 15 minutes late.</p><p>Lise and Jørgen came to pick us up and take us to their flat which they kindly gave us for our holiday. We unpacked, and headed straight for town on the 2A bus.</p><p>The weather was changeable, but we walked through the city centre unscathed on to the Round Tower. There Katie enjoyed hiding in the little cave holes and jumping out on the rest of us.</p>

    <title>Denmark Holiday - Church and Oldemor</title>
    <info>
		<p>We popped over to Lise and Jørgen’s summer house for a Danish Sunday breakfast. Pastries and rolls</p><p>The weather continued to be a problem when we dropped Lise, Mummy and Farfar off at St Albans, whilst we went with Daddy and Jørgen to see the little mermaid. But the heavens opened and we all got soaked. Still Katie liked the Mermaid and it was lucky she didn't slip into the sea for a swim. Despite the weather there seemed to be loads of tourists mainly from Eastern Europe.</p><p>As we were so wet we returned to the flat to get changed before venturing to Herlev to see Oldemor.</p><p>Oldemor was in good form. Daddy made her laugh anyway when he tried her glasses on! She didn't seem to comprehend that her 2 great grandchildren had entered the room, or at least didn't show much emotion, but we were to expect that, and we hoped that we wouldn't over awed her. We had some dinner, but didn't spend more than an hour or so with her. She was quite happy knitting.</p><p>We made the long journey home, pleased having spent some time with Oldemor.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_08_13-EllenMartinBen.jpg</src><caption>Ben and Oldemor meet</caption></image>

    <title>Denmark Holiday - Zoo</title>
    <info>
		<p>The zoo was possibly the kids favourite day. We arrived mid-morning and circled the old zoo. We first saw the polar bear and brown bear, restless, standing on its hind legs. A big mother. We saw a huge bull elephant in one enclosure who was trying to cause mischief with all his lady relatives who were in another part. There was a large development program to build the elephants a new enclosure. Katie of course loved the animals, but Ben was now beginning to also show a real interest. Flapping arms and high pitched squeals told us that he enjoyed it. We saw tigers, lions, leopards, sea lions, etc..</p><p>We later went under the tunnel to the Children’s Zoo. Ben's favourite were the Tasmanian Devil's, which are the only ones to be found outside Australia apparently. They ferret around and cause mischief, just like Ben! There were all the usual farm yard type animals as well as giraffes and zebras.</p><p>We later circled the park once more this time in the train to say goodbye to all the animals.</p><woops rating="7" woopstitle="Evacuation of bus in rush-hour Copenhagen"><p>On the bus coming back from the Zoo in the rush hour. Bus full of commuters and I'm sitting next to nice looking blonde! The stomach turned, apologized to the lady and rushed to the front of the bus about to ask the driver to stop..... but too late..... Weeerrrr, weeerrr, chunder, chunder.</p><p>I tried to catch the mashed nectarines so not to make too much mess in the bus. My head slumped over, I look across to the bus driver with my eyes pleading at him to stop and open the doors..... he blanked me and continued to throw up twice more.</p><p>Up the entrance doors of the bus, on the floor, all over my t-shirt and trousers. Nice! He eventually stopped, I hopped out, lent up against some house and continued what I obviously hadn't finished off. Katie was crying at the sight of me hurling. I'd woke Ben up, who now was also crying. The bus continued with the Lau and the screaming kids with people giving Laura evil looks.</p><p>The bus driver contacted 'control' and was told to return to the garage immediately. The 40 or so people on the bus had to all get out and catch the next bus which I had later got on! Thought in the interests of Danish/Anglo relations I'd hop off!</p></woops><p>Daddy ended up being sick 5 times in the end.... once at both ends at the same time.</p><p>Also Katie wasn't happy with the situation and wanted to go home.</p><ul><li><i>katie</i>I want to go home.
        </li><li><i>mummy</i>We can't go home darling. All the pilots have gone to bed.
        </li><li><i>katie</i>We go and wake the 'pirates' up.

		<p>Mummy and Daddy were under the weather today. Therefore they felt it best not to visit Oldemor which was a real shame. So in the morning we took a walk around the beach area close to the flat. Farfar thankfully came over to help out.</p><p>We then went a very scenic route to meet up with Farmor at the main line station for some lunch. We tried to get some Calpol for Ben, but was told that it is prescription only. Thankfully we didn't need it in the end.</p><p>Tivoli was our next stop. The Fars had kindly paid for the entrance and for Katie to go on all the rides.</p><p>Katie went on the cars twice, the planes twice where she could control her altitude, a motorbike and a boat on the lake. Lise and Jørgen joined with up with us later on.</p>

    <title>Hyde Park - Oxford and Regent Street</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy was supposed to be doing her training to be a community emergency response lady, but yet again that was cancelled due to others pulling out. So instead the four of us went up to London.</p><p>After we finally parked in Turnham Green, we caught a double decker (yes Daddy they're are double deckers this far out of the West End!) to Notting Hill gate and entered Hyde Park.</p><p>We first hit the very different playground. Sort of a playground for the rich. A lot of local 'lar de das'. There was a huge wooden ship which Daddy and Katie climbed to the top of the mast and pretended to be pirates! There were wigwams and the usual slides and swings.</p><p>
        We walked down to the<a href="http://www.royalparks.gov.uk/parks/hyde_park/diana_memorial.cfm">Diana's Memorial Fountain</a>and dipped out feet in the freezing cold water. We stopped here for our picnic, before making our way to
        <a href="http://www.travellondon.com/templates/attractions/gallery_Speakerscorner.html">
          Speakers Corner
        </a>
        .
      </p><p>We all went on Bob Wilson's old fashioned carrousels which we all enjoyed. Katie and Ben also went on the small roundabout.</p><p>We went passed the mini Arc De Triomphe (Marble Arch) and walked along Oxford and Regent's street. We got Ben's first pair of shoes in Clarks and wafted around Hamley's. Katie got stuck in the Barbie section with Mummy, whilst Daddy and Ben were watching the radio controlled cars and playing with the trains! Stereotypical eh?</p><p>We bussed it back again and wearily made our way back home.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_08_26-09-London.jpg</src><caption>Us at the Diana Memorial Fountain</caption></image>

    <title>Farfar's 60th Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>Farfar had invited Shirley and Michael, Ron and Maureen, Graham's Parents, Ma Ma and Pop Pop and half a dozen Railway men to celebrate his 60th birthday.</p><p>The weather held off and Graham had prepared an excellent BBQ'ed pork, slow cooked for 3 hours to go along with Farmor's excellent culinary efforts. We sat on long tables and tucked in. Katie and Ben were amusing themselves with the toys in the back garden.</p><p>After Farfar's speech we had desert and we went with Ma Ma, Pop Pop, Ellie and Joey to the swings opposite the hospital, which was a bit further away than we thought.</p><p>It was nice to see everyone, particularly Uncle Ron who we don't see so often. He is very laid back and easy to talk to.</p><p>We left for home about 6-ish. Daddy returned later to help wash up and the railway crew were still going strong at 9pm! A lovely day.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_08_27-09-Farfar60thParty.jpg</src><caption>Garden Party</caption></image>

    <title>Marwell Zoo</title>
    <info>
		<p>We travelled down south and met with Joey and Uncle Michael at Marwell Zoo. It was nice for Daddy and Michael as they don't spend enough time with all us under 4's! Anyway the relatively expensive admission did not match the number and quality of animals. The lions had left the zoo, the cheetahs were asleep, the tigers were hiding! Anyway we lapped around the park in the train and enjoyed the rhinos and giraffes the most.</p><p>Mummy's highlight was when she took Joey on the roundabout-chair ride.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_08_28-14-MarwellZoo.jpg</src><caption>Katie, Joey and Ben</caption></image>

    <info>
		<p>We went to see Auntie Karen and Summer today, Auntie Ellie and Joey came too. Katie loves it so much there because Summer has got such lovely toys indoor and out. After that we went to Ma Ma and Pop Pop's (or popadoodles as Katie calls him). We had tea and a bath, then Ben went to sleep but Katie wouldn't. Mummy and Pop Pop were due to go to the cinema and Katie was more than happy to stay up and watch Bambi with Ma Ma and Auntie Ellie with a little treat. Apparently she loved the film and only had to hide twice under the covers with Ma Ma! Mummy and Pop Pop really enjoyed the film Snakes on a Plane.</p>

    <title>New Barn Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went to Gravesend in the morning to do a few jobs then we went to New Barn Park. We got the little train to the swings which Ben loved. Joey and Katie went in the little paddling pool while Ben ate his lunch. We went in the swing park, had a lolly pop (Ben had mine) and then Mummy had to really persuade Katie to go on the little chair merry-go-round because she wanted to go on the teacups. Once she was on it though she shouted "I love this ride mummy" which was good because they were always mummy’s favourite as well. Joey went on it as well and he wasn’t sure at first but then he saw Katie laughing and he was fine.</p>

		<p>Ma Ma came over for the day and we took her to Wizzy world. It was good but as it was the school holidays it was packed and with lots of big children and it was also so hot in there. Ma Ma enjoyed taking Katie round, and Oliver and Henry came later, they all played so well, waiting for each other. After this we popped in to see Uncle Howard at Wicks, Freya's to drop off the gazebo and Great Grandma and Granddad’s house.</p>

    <title>Finkley Down Farm - Casuals Reunion</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went to the farm today with a few of Katie's playschool friends and their mums. It was a lovely day. Ben loved the animals. Katie loved the swings as usual and the trampolines. She groomed a big pony and stroked a mouse which Amelia held. We had a nice picnic and didn't get home until late.</p><p>Daddy went to the Prince Of Wales (or Princess Of Wales as Baz calls it) for the Casuals RIP do. It was great to see so many faces not seen for a while. Barrie was waiting for Daddy with a pint. The drinking went a little too well. Anyway Gary, Nick, Martin and Phil all also turned up half an hour early! I repeat there was 6 of us half an hour early! Mike Collis, Age Williams, Phil C, Dave Weaver, Dawg, Vincey and Paul Deer turned up. It was like the good old days. Barrie and Gary on top form. It was nice to see a video of Gary's twins. They did look ever so cute. We got chucked out late and Daddy proceeded to meander home on his push-bike. The night ended predictably with a couple of hurls and having to sleep downstairs on the floor! One day Daddy will grow up!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_09_01-Casuals.jpg</src><caption>Casuals Farewell</caption></image>

    <title>Coral Reef, Look Out - 6th Wedding Anniversary</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today Mummy had her first lesson to be a community emergency response lady, so she was training with a defibrillator, doing CPR and the such like.</p><p>This left Daddy, with a hangover to take us out. We went to the Fars where we played quite a bit before heading to Bracknell and the Look Out. We had a mooch around the 'Go Ape' ariel assault course which Farmor confidently said she wanted to go on for her 60th. We then saw some of the longer, higher abseil runs which turned her enthusiasm a bit I think.</p><p>We had lunch at the playground which we all enjoyed. Benny turned a few of the ladies heads again with his smile. Katie loved going around the big wooden castle.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_09_02-KatieBen.jpg</src><caption>Katie and Ben having a rocking time</caption></image><p>We then popped across the road to Coral Reef which was packed. Katie loved her mini slide whilst Daddy took Ben on the 'Family' flume which Ben enjoyed which was a relief.</p><p>It was 6 years ago that Mummy and Daddy got married. Tonight they went to the Wings restaurant, which is on the boat at the Lakeside complex for a Chinese meal. It was lovely, especially with a pianist playing in the corner. We got a shock when the bill came to £100. Fortunately this was for another table. Mummy went for a vegetarian option, whilst Daddy went for the Dumplings and Tropical Duck!</p>

		<p>Church and Photo scanning in the morning.</p><p>The afternoon turned out really nice. 25 degrees. We headed to Staines to a playground we visited a couple of years ago. Anyway there was a really cool water park bit where there were fountains spurting water up. Benny took a while to get used to it and enjoy it. Katie on the other hand was in and out and sitting on the fountains. Katie brought her 'big girls bike' and we rode to feed the ducks and go on the playground. Playground are the kids favourite form of entertainment at the moment.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_09_03-01-Staines.jpg</src><caption>Splash, splash, splash</caption></image>

		<p>Daddy sometimes takes on his Bike up to the community centre and back. Real slow. On this occasion Daddy took Ben over, however, this time the Police happened to be passing by</p><p>"You are joking aren't you?", barked out of the Police car by a police woman. Anyway Daddy was very apologetic and had to return Ben home on foot before coming back for the bike! Anyway I think that has put paid to our little rides. :(</p>

		<p>Mummy, Katie and Boo went to meet Ma Ma and Pop Pop at Reigate Park. We had a picnic and then fed the ducks. We didn't have any bread but a kind man took pity on us and made his daughter give us some of her bread! We had a go on the swings and then had a much needed ice cream as it was very hot. Boo had a lolly but preferred to eat the stick, much to Pop Pops horror as the lolly melted down Ben's arm (Pop Pop hates sticky mess)! Mummy then got stung  on the back of her leg by a wasp as she bent down to put Katie's shoes back on and it did hurt. We had a walk round the park and went back to the swings before coming home.</p>

    <title>Blue Light Surfing</title>
    <info>
		<p extra="phrase">I want to coin the phrase 'Blue Light Surfing'. It's when an ambulance or police car has got it's blue lights on and all the cars pull to one side giving space for them to go through. It also gives space for me to follow right behind as well. Very handy for getting through traffic fast.</p>

    <title>Odds Farm</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy was at her Community Responder course, leaving Daddy being responsible for us! We took Farmor and Auntie Susan to visit Odds Farm. It was a nice day and we were excited when we got in and saw the rabbits and guinea pigs. We both climbed in the pen to feed the rabbits and even stroked them!</p><p>We jumped around on the hail bails and played on the cars before making our way outside to catch the end of the sheep race. There were lots of playgrounds there, so I think we were more interested in that than the animals.</p><p>We caught the midday tractor ride, then had lunch (whilst playing on the playground). We continued around and Katie almost fed the goats. Ben surprisingly said 'go', meaning 'goats'. Another word to add to his vocabulary.</p><p>We saw Farfar in the piggy enclosure, and saw a lovely big horse (whose breed escapes me). We ended with a talk on the rare breeds of goat that were there. Over all Ben really enjoyed getting close to the animals, and felt proud when he stroked the rabbits.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_09_16-16a-OddsFarm.jpg</src><caption>The Odds</caption></image>

    <title>Grand Union Canal, National Carriage Championships</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Katie and Mummy went to (boring) church, whilst Daddy and Ben continued on the Grand Union trail, starting where we last left off in Cranbrook (just by the Bulls Bridge).</p><p>We can't say it was the most picturesque of rides, but it must have been quite an experience for Ben riding past the factories with the different industrial smells and sounds and the sheer size of some of the places. There was a lot of rubbish in places as well. We even went passed a hangout for what I can only assume were drunks or druggies.</p><p>There were plenty of style type gates, which was particularly awkward to begin with until Daddy tried, lifting the bike with one hand, whilst swinging on the gate support with the other and swinging Ben over the water whilst still on the bike. I think Mummy would have gone mad if she knew (she never reads this anyway).</p><p>It was a really hot 22+ degrees which for the middle of September is quite something. Anyway we were restricted by time and only made it to Cowley Recreation ground (see Google Earth) where we stopped off and played in the swing park.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_09_17-04-GrandUnionWindsor.jpg</src><caption>Grand Union</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_09_17-07-GrandUnionWindsor.jpg</src><caption>Oh So Grand Ben</caption></image><p>We made our way back in the Hayes direction twice as quick as our outward journey. Ben was quite quiet and serious on the back.... chilling and taking it all in Daddy likes to think.</p><p>In the afternoon we went over to Windsor Great Park and stopped off to the National Carriage Riding championships. It was funny to see people all dressed up riding the lovely horses around. We sneaked in and went by the main arena. Only later did we discover we had to pay. Ooops never mind. Again Ben really got excited when he saw the animals.</p>

    <title>Longleat Safari Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went with the Weston clan to Longleat Safari Park. We met up before hand and converged into two cars. It was pretty busy and again unseasonally hot.</p><p>Benny boy was loving it to begin with, sticking his head out of the window to the giraffes, camel and zebras. Katie had seen it all before of course.</p><p>We quickly made our way to the naughty monkey area. Well our car ariel got ripped off. Gee thanks. Plus sabotage from the other car as they planted a cookie on our back windscreen wiper. There was only a little bit of damage.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_09_23-42-Longleat.jpg</src><caption>Monkey on our backs</caption></image><p>Anyway I don't think Ben knew what to quite make of them being so close. He took it in his stride, but was very interested in them. Katie noticed they had red bottoms!</p><p>Unfortunately one of the tigers died in the summer (who we had seen on the TV programme), so there was just the one tiger which we didn't get a great view of which was a bit of a shame. However, it was at least a bit more lively than the lazy pride of lions where were basking in the midday sun.</p><p>Our 1 hour plus tour of the animals ended with us in need of our picnic.</p><p>Daddy and Ben went to see the racing cars in the car park which was nice. We ate our picnic, played a bit of bally before making our way to the trip on the boat.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_09_23-14-Longleat.jpg</src><caption>Ben impressed with the cars</caption></image><p>The lake was filled with Sea Lions and a couple of hippos. We were thrilled to see the Sea Lions jump out of the water alongside the boat.</p><p>The hippos and gorilla's on the island were a bit disappointing as they barely moved. Still we returned to the old terra cotta (as Del Boy says). We split in two. Us kiddies and mummies went to the Postman Pat village which we all enjoyed. It was a model village where you could press buttons to make some of the models move. The others went on the 'stimulator' as Mummy put it! A real back breaker.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_09_23-27-Longleat.jpg</src><caption>Ice cream kids</caption></image><p>We went on the train around the park, then into Pets Corner where some of us touched/stroked a snake. Well Joey almost out pythoned the python by giving it a could squeeze. 'Joey in a china shop'. Some unmentionables were too scared to even touch the snake.</p><p>We finally went on the tea cup ride. Katie said this was her favourite part of the day. Pop Pop made a great impression on the girl in his cup. She looked thrilled.</p><p>We raced home for fish and chips then straight to bed.</p>

    <title>Grace Pragassen's Christening</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy again had her Community Responder course, leaving Daddy to look after us. We dropped mummy off and walked into Frimley Green. Katie and Daddy held hands and chatted and sang songs most of the way there which was nice for Daddy.</p><p>At the library Katie just picked the first 7 books she found, which isn't very good. Ben on the other hand was going around the library pulling all the books off the shelves and squawking loudly. Daddy was a bit out of control. Still we managed to get some books and Katie got a sticker as she is part of the book club.</p><p>We then decided to walk to the Fars. Only Farfar was in and we played lots in the front room.</p><p>We got a lift back home and rushed our lunch and getting change to scooted down to the church in Sevenoaks. We arrived just in time and walked straight pass Grace. She is so different to Georgia, I couldn't believe it. Claire was in fine, bubbly form as usual and helped us along during the day.</p><p>The church service was quite informal it felt although none of us will really know as Daddy was chasing us around the church pews most of the time. Ben was squashing grapes on the cushions and squeezing under the pews whilst Katie found it funny to keep moving seat! Ben filled his nappy at the beginning of the service and stank, whilst Katie needed the toilet. So Daddy took us all outside, got the potty from the car and perched Katie at the side of the road to do her business, whilst trying to stop Ben from running into the road! This parenting lark is not easy when there is just the one of you.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_09_30-01-GracePragassenChristening.jpg</src><caption>Grace being Christened</caption></image><p>The service lasted under 30 minutes and there was a nice warm atmosphere. After the service we made the short trip to the lovely looking village of Chipstead, where the Pragassen's lived. There was some food laid on at the George and Dragon where we spent the rest of the afternoon.</p><p>We played in the garden with Georgia and her cousin which was nice. Georgia has grown into a confident, cracking girl. Unrecognisable from when we last saw her, 2.5 years previous.</p><p>We managed to chat to both Claire and James and everything seemed to be going very well. It's good to see them again and we really do need to meet up more often.</p><p>There were plenty of other children under 5 there for Katie to play with. She was quite taken with Daniel and they chatted and played very nicely together. It was nice to see.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_09_30-08-GracePragassenChristening.jpg</src><caption>Katie was very keen on Daniel</caption></image><p>After Champagne and cake we made our way back home late back to mummy. Daddy just about managed and found it very rewarding. A lovely, tiring day.</p>

    <info>
		<p>The rest of the company were told today that the company was subject to a trade sale. Basically we are being taken over by a Nasdeq listed company but yet to know who.</p><p>What this all means for Daddy is that the shares and share options are finally liquidated, but also his job potentially is under threat depending on what the new owners decide to do with us. The sale has not gone through yet, but it is only a matter of time. A sad time really, but business is business and things must move on.</p>

    <title>Herne Bay, Derek Belsey Charity Football Match</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy went to Chertsey in the morning to play in front of 150+ spectators in a charity match in aid of Derek Belsey (ex Chertsey Manager) who has terminal cancer. Daddy enjoyed the game, especially as it was played on the hallowed turf of Alwyns Lane. Big Pitch + Long Grass + No Right Midfielder + Unfit anyway = Exhausted.</p><p>The rest of us went to Church. Katie went with the big boys and girls to Sunday school.</p><p>In the afternoon we went to Herne Bay and dipped our toes in the sea and had chips! Ma Ma also naughtily bought Katie some new shoes.</p>

    <title>Yelaina Birthday, Swimming</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we tootled into Camberley dropping Katie and Mummy off at the Arena for Elaina's birthday. They had setup a bouncy castle and soft play, but we considered it a bit old for Ben. Ben and Daddy went off to do some 'man' shopping at the butcher shop!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_10_14-05-KatiePartyDress.jpg</src><caption>Party Outfit</caption></image><p>In the afternoon we Ben and Daddy came over and we went swimming still at the Arena. We also managed to pick up a Woolworths catalogue which Katie, in her womanly ways, began circling items she would like for Christmas. Apparently she was doing her homework!</p><p>Ben is continuing to be quite grizzlely at the moment, and we're not sure why. It could be the MMR jab last week, or that teeth are coming through. He's not eating like a good boy either. The spots that are all over his body are still there, but the doctor just said come back in a month. He's not seen his condition before, rather worryingly.</p>

    <title>Grand Union Bike Ride, Windsor Great Park walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>Whilst Mummy and Katie were enjoying themselves at church, Daddy and Ben continued their journey north along the Grand Union canal, starting at Cowley, where they had left off a couple of weeks back.</p><p>Merrily on their way, unknown to them they had a puncture! Daddy hoped it was a slow puncture and asked a bargeman to lend us a pump. We continued another half a mile or so only to find the tyre had gone down even quicker! It was a 2 mile walk back to the car! Still, the weather was pleasant. It was a nice walk back.</p><p>In the afternoon we headed to Windsor Great Park and had a nice walk around.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_10_15-05-KatieBenLaura-WindsorPark.jpg</src><caption>Windsor Great Park</caption></image>

    <title>FormScape Buy Out - Shares and Redundancy</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today was a reliving end to a hellish week. Monday we were officially bought out by Bottomline Technologies, a Nasdaq, American competitor. It was mentioned that up to 20 members of staff in the UK were to be made redundant. Quite a high figure as there were only 60 odd employees. Of course I was worried, but we in development thought we wouldn't be hit to hard! How wrong we were, as we were announced into Tuesday that 10 in our room were to go, 3 of which from Development!</p><p>Wednesday and Thursday were spent deliberating who was to go.... and this was a terrible time. Kind of akin to waiting to see if you were going to be hanged or not. I guessed I was in the bottom 4 and giving myself a %25 chance of staying. However, the wait was agonising and I couldn't work / think. Mentally draining. Because of UK law, management couldn't just choose someone and march them out like in the US, we had to be given reasons for redundancy and a scoring criteria was set out marking each individual in 30 different areas of the job.</p><p>David Winkworth was first to go on Thursday night and as soon as I knew that, my chance diminished to 99% chance of ending my days.</p><p>Funnily enough, I came to terms with this within an hour or so on Thursday night and felt happy as the pressure was off.</p><p>However, my mood turned into sadness on Friday morning as I waited and waited to get my cards. Just couldn't handle it. I was finally called into a room with Debbie and Darren and given the news.</p><p>My redundancy terms were</p><ul><li><i>Consultancy Period</i>1 week
        </li><li><i>Notice</i>9 weeks (1 week for every year worked)
        </li><li><i>Holiday owing</i>1 week
        </li><li><i>Redundancy</i>9 weeks (1 week for every year worked - not taxable)
        </li></ul><p>Overall I reckon I will be given between 5 and 6 months normal pay. This is a great relief and may end quite beneficial for us.</p><p>Did I agree I should go? Well maybe, maybe not. I agree I am the worst probably technically out of the 9. However, I can't believe that I am in the bottom 3 for personality traits or product knowledge. Anyway I have accepted the decision and not looking forward to the job seeking process, but I am looking forward to a fresh environment and challenge.</p><p>As part of my preparation for getting a job I need to obviously get a CV written. Currently I have nothing. Also, and maybe more importantly I need to gem up in quite a few areas in order to impress an interviewer and maybe more importantly get my confidence levels a lot higher, as currently I don't feel great.</p><p>On Wednesday the share money from the buy-out hit our account which equated to the equivalent of another 6 months’ salary. So not all bad at the end of the day. For me to get on with my career, I needed to leave FormScape, and the only way that was going to happen was for something like this. So I guess I am trying to say this can be seen as a blessing in disguise...... just hope it doesn't turn into a nightmare.</p><p>I would like to think that I get a number of interviews before Christmas. If I don't get a job by March then I guess questions will need to be asked why... and perhaps I ought to turn to something else. e.g. drilling!</p>

    <title>George, Andrew and the Tram Museum</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie was very excited at the prospect of going on holiday, mainly because we promised her fish and chips and to stay in a hotel overnight.</p><p>We got up a little after 6am and set off, arriving at George and Andrews house at 11. The weather wasn't great, a little cold and a little rainy.</p><p>We stopped for a cup of tea, wandered down to see the horses, cows and unwelcomed dogs, then had some lunch before heading off to the tram museum.</p><p>The museum had a load of old trams, which Daddy enjoyed, as well as a playground, where Benny fell off the roundabout and a soft play area.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_10_22-03-AndrewGeorges.jpg</src><caption>Katie getting some good numbers!</caption></image><p>We had a go on the tram which went up to the old quarry. Ben and Katie were definitely not on their best behaviour today. They were testing the patience of all the adults I think.</p><p>We returned back to Andrew and Georges for some lovely fish and chips, before heading to our hotel in Alfreton.</p>

    <title>Peak Cavern, Peveril Castle, Matlock Bath</title>
    <info>
		<p>After a scare of losing the car keys, we ventured through the undulating, picturesque Peak District to the touristy Castleton. There we dared to go in one of the many caves, Peak Cavern (aka Devils Arse). It was quite an impressive approach as the river ran alongside us, and cliffs towered over the top.</p><p>Katie told us to be careful as we might get attacked by bears! Let’s hope not. The guide was very animated which made the tour in the caverns that much more atmospheric. There was a huge opening to the cave, and some parts required us to crouch right down to pass. We had to be careful not to get wet as there was quite a bit of 'rain' falling down. Benny Boo was even getting into it all.</p><p>We took a country road through a place called Hope and stopped off for a picnic at the side of the road. We could see for miles. It was lovely.</p><p>Back into Castleton for part 2 - Peveril Castle. Wow what a steep walk to even get there. This time we had to be careful of 'giants'. The castle was pretty much ruined 500 years ago so there was not much to see. However, we enjoyed the trek there and looking around the grounds and the keep. Katie won a sticker for finding 8 squires and knights!</p><p>After a lolly and a coast around the souvenir shops we got in the car and all dozed as Daddy drove onto the next stop, Matlock Bath. It was so sweet as Katie sang herself to sleep in the car. Singing one minute, eyes closed the next.</p><p>Here we just perused the shops, walked by the river and of course went on some much needed 'swing park' therapy.</p><p>As a complete contrast to yesterday, Katie and Ben were great and a joy to be with.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_10_23-01-Castleton.jpg</src><caption>Castleton Montage</caption></image>

    <title>Great Grandad in hospital</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ma Ma came to stay for three days as it was half term, but unfortunately Great Grandad was rushed to hospital with a bad stomach ulcer which made him very ill. We went in to see him in the afternoon but Katie was a bit scared as he didn't look himself so we went for a walk while Great Grandma and Ma Ma sat with Great Grandad. Then we went to see Uncle John Garratt who has been ill as well and we did his shopping for him.</p>

    <info>
		<p>We took Great Grandma to have her hair cut as Great Grandad is still in hospital and then we went for lunch in Tesco. Ma Ma bought Katie, Ben and Joey a Pumpkin bucket ready for next week. Then we went to Camberley as Great Grandma wanted to go to Primark. While Ma Ma, Great Grandma and Katie went there Mummy and Ben went to Boots for some nappies, when we met up again, Ma Ma and Great Grandma had bought Katie a pair of Patent leather black boots which Mummy did not approve of but Katie loved. She has such a love for shoes at the moment, we have to try them on every shop we go to.  We then went to see Great Grandad who was a lot better. In the evening the hospital called to say we could go and pick Great Grandad up so Katie went with Ma Ma to do this and they had a great time. Katie did not stop talking apparently.</p>

		<p>Today we met Auntie Ellie and Joey at Alice Holt country park for a picnic, it was so muddy. There was some lovely equipment to climb on. Katie and mummy climbed a big tall tower and went inside a giant owl. We had a lovely walk and a go on the swings. From there we went to a garden centre to look at the Christmas decorations and then for a final visit to Great grandma and Grandad's. Ben and Mummy nipped Great grandma to the library, while Katie and Ma Ma stayed with Great Grandad. In the evening Mummy, Daddy, Ma Ma, Pop Pop, Auntie Ellie, Auntie Charlotte, Auntie Sue and Uncle Richard went to see the Counterfeit Stones an Camberley theatre which was great. We had a meal first. Mummy, Auntie Sue and Ma Ma were dancing! Uncle Michael babysat.</p>

    <title>Southsea</title>
    <info>
		<p>After church and Daddy's Sunday lunch we scooted down to the coast for the afternoon. Southsea front is a nightmare to get to. We remember last time the traffic. Oh well, we got there and it was a sunny day.</p><p>Some dared to get their feet wet in the sea, whilst others took photos! It was freezing. We skimmed stones. Ben's throwing accuracy has little to be desired, most thrown in a random direction, not necessarily towards the sea. The boy is a menace.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_10_29-06a-Southsea.jpg</src><caption>Dipping Toes In</caption></image><p>We meandered to the pier along the painted pavement lines. There was a small swimming pool thingy which had high walls. Mummy let him try and get in, but thought the walls were too high. WRONG! Ben managed to go head first into the water, soaking him through! Other people on the pier were amazed that he could get in. Some just laughed. A bit embarrassing. Mummy had to take him back to the car and get changed!</p><p>In the meantime Daddy and Katie went on the only amusement on the pier which was a bouncy castle, followed by the playground train.</p><p>After a Callipo (on a very cold day) we went to the huge swing park, then home.</p>

There was also a little farm and an underwater world with a crocodile which Katie loved. We had a picnic and an ice-lolly that Katie wanted even though it was freezing. As it was Halloween season there was a grotto with ghosts and fake spiders etc. that were moving, which they all loved and wanted to go through again and again. We had a lovely day.</p>

		<p>The day started with pre-school for Katie and then she had her first swimming lesson. She was brilliant. She got so much praise from the instructors and she went in with them all on her own while Mummy and Ben watched from the side. Mummy felt so proud of her as she swam on her back and front and jumped in.</p><p>From swimming Katie put on her Batgirl outfit and Ben his cat costume and we went to Farfar and Farmor’s and Great Grandma and Grandad’s trick or treating. Joey came to dressed as a spider. Great grandma had a few of her neighbours for us to visit too, so they all managed to fill up their big pumpkin buckets that Ma Ma had bought them with lots of sweets.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_10_31-12a-Halloween.jpg</src><caption>Knock, Knock - Trick Or Treat</caption></image><p>From there we came home and Oliver, Henry, Joshua, Poppy and James came over for a little tea all dressed up. Katie really enjoyed the evening as well, we had four lots of tick or treaters knock on the door and she gave them the sweets we had bought for them. What a busy day!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_10_31-08-Halloween.jpg</src><caption>Halloween Tea Party</caption></image>

    <title>Longleat and Fireworks</title>
    <info>
		<p>Starting to get cold now and are original plan of going to Harrods to see the Christmas parade didn't happen because we would have needed an exceptionally early start.</p><p>So instead we went down to Longleat again to use the tickets up - so a nice cheap day for the unemployed family!</p><p>First we went into the best maze in the world we reckon! We split into teams, Boys V Girls. Girls found the middle in about 15 minutes, Boys about 30 minutes. However the tables were turned when we had to get out. Katie got a bit hysterical when she got trapped in! No surprise there then.</p><p>We went in the excellent castle adventure playground area where I think the kids could have stayed for hours and hours. There was a soft play area, swing park and an ariel trail thingy which Katie was very keen on.</p><p>After our picnic, we went in the bat cave and saw the parrot show, which Katie was amazed at. So funny watching her face as the parrots were performing their tricks. Not really clapping or smiling, just a dropped jaw as if she couldn't believe what she was seeing!</p><p>We finished off with a go on the tea cup ride and a tour around Postman Pats village. A great time without actually having to see any animals really.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_11_04-10a-Longleat.jpg</src><caption>Postman Pat and his black and white kids!</caption></image><p>In the evening we went out with Farmor, Karen and Richard and the West crew to the fireworks over in Fleet. Katie was very excited and talked and talked about which are her favourites, which other peoples favourites were. We got there, all waiting for the first firework. Up they went.... down came the tears, from both Katie and Ben. We persisted for about 5 minutes before we had to make our way out of the arena and hide behind the shops! Wimps the pair of them.</p>

    <title>Greenwich, Car Overheats, Ellie's Baby Shower, FormScape Reunion</title>
    <info>
		<p>Well yesterday we came down to Gravesend to see Karen and Summer and stayed over at Ma Ma and Pop Pops.</p><p>We ventured up to Greenwich Park. We walked through to see the very tame squirrels, fed the ducks and saw the deer and then the highlight.... the super, big playground! Katie and Mummy were trying to run away from Daddy and Ben, but the boys caught up!</p><p>Walking into Greenwich we happened to pass a sweet shop near the market! Funnily enough the girls were hungry and happened to stumble into the shop. The boys on the other hand were told they were not allowed their pie and mash from Goddard’s until Daddy gets a job! One rule for the girls another for the boys.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_11_11-06-Greenwich.jpg</src><caption>Sweets anyone?</caption></image><p>We then had races down and up the foot tunnel and had our lunch at Island Gardens on a picnic bench. It was cold.</p><p>We carried on passed a kiddies football match, where one 10 year old, sithed another and then a pushing match ensued. Quite funny really, although the Premiership has got a lot to answer for!</p><p>Mudchute Farm is a funny old place. Not sure who runs it. Just seem to be prisoners and kids there. Perhaps I am being a little unfair. Ben enjoyed the donkeys, Katie the horses of course and Daddy the pigs.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_11_11-08a-Greenwich.jpg</src><caption>Ahh - Benny and Chip-Chop</caption></image><p>The weather was getting cold, so we decided to head back the couple of mile back to the car.</p><p>On the way home Daddy luckily noticed that the temperature gauge was off the maximum. We pulled off at the next junction, but the engine cut out before we could get to a garage. We walked into Leatherhead to get some water from the supermarket. Back at the car Daddy filled the radiator expansion bottle, however it was pretty full beforehand! Mmmm.</p><p>We carried on and just managed to get off the motorway at Chertsey before the engine cut out again. This time Daddy poured water into the actual radiator and it was like Mount Vesuvius! Steam, water and what looked like oil spluttering back out again! Oh Oh. Oil in the radiator. Head Gasket? Anyway we stopped a couple of times further before finally making it home.</p><p>In the evening Katie and Mummy went off to Ellie's baby shower. Katie, who hadn't slept all day, was a good girl and stayed up until 11pm.... stuffing herself with sweets, crisps and nik naks! She was in her element. She's far too grown up.</p><p>Daddy on the other hand had organised a trip out with the FormScape boys in Guildford. Surprisingly quite a few turned up which was nice. Everyone was kind and wanted to know how Daddy was doing.</p>

    <title>Karen and Richards Lunch</title>
    <info>
		<p>Derek had kindly said he'd take a look at the car which meant that we had fun and games getting to church and getting to Karen and Richard's. Ben's blasted child seat just didn't want to leave the car!</p><p>The lunch was magnificent! Yum, yum. Making my tummy rumble at the thought of it. Anyway after lunch we walked over to Redfields and had a little look around all the Christmas stuff . Naughty Karen bought me some lovely things.</p><p>We chilled out (as much as you can with Katie and Ben) and had a cup of tea and made our way home before Benny the Destructor and Katie Whiney pants destroyed the Sanders abode.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_11_12-02a-KR-KatieFatherXmas.jpg</src><caption>Katie, meet Father Christmas</caption></image>

    <title>Southfleet Autumn Fete</title>
    <info>
		<p>We drove over to Southfleet for their Autumn fete. Pop Pop posed as Father Christmas in a darkened room. Katie sort of guess it was Pop Pop as he didn't do a good job of disguising his voice. It was funny to see her face as she was trying to work out if we were telling the truth when we said it wasn't him. We seriously don't want the dream to go just yet! Ben on the other hand balled his eyes out.</p><p>We bought some tat and headed back to the Weston household for lunch. Afterwards we went down to Cascades for a spot of swimming which Ben particularly liked as he could run around in the shallow end.</p>

    <title>Dixons Of Deal.... nightmare</title>
    <info>
		<p>After church we arranged to go for lunch at the Dixon household. We started off fine. Katie and Ben were very playful and we had to keep a firm eye that nothing in the house would get broken or ruined. The lunch was scrummy, but both children mis-behaved which was rather embarrassing. However, this was not unexpected and it has made Daddy realise that we really have to tighten the reigns. Katie is such a fussy, whiney eater. Every day we have problems at dinner time. Ben is just so messy and impossible to feed without a high chair.</p><p>Anyway we decided to escape and go for a walk along the beach and pier. We had a nice cup of tea, but again Katie and Ben were playing up.</p><p>We spoke to Sharon about her impending wedding. All quite exciting, but I think Linda is taking over the organisation of it all.</p><p>We had fun and games again on the way home when the car overheated! Grrrr. Took us 3 hours to get home.</p>

    <title>Job Hunting</title>
    <info>
		<p>Well it has now been a month now since Daddy was made redundant from FormScape. It has not been easy, but at least there is light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>A month ago Daddy could not contemplate looking for another job. Zero preparation. No CV, a need to mug up on C++, interview techniques, employment agents and technical test.... all this with a whiff who is constantly pressurising.</p><p>Daddy decided to tackle one problem at a time. First the CV. Karen helped Daddy construct a CV which took 25 hours to write from scratch.</p><p>A week was then spent on mugging up on C++, specifically on threading. Daddy submitted his CV to a handful of sites and a number of recommended employment agents. The two main sites that got the most leads were cwjobs and planetrecruit.</p><p>Daddy also contacted his old CEO, Keith Bloodworth seeing if he had any jobs or interest. He did and Daddy went for an interview, which was rather strange as 85% of it was spent them demoing their product to me. It was very impressive.</p><p>Had other interviews with Imagineer (Guildford), Softalk (Maidenhead), Aircom (Leatherhead) and NDS (Staines). Daddy also had tests with Barclays Capital in the city. Daddy grew more and more confident with each interview. Each were quite different. Softalk interrogated my MFC and threading experience for a total of 4.5 hours verbally and a day’s coding test, whilst Imagineer was an 1.5 hour chat!</p><p>All companies were offering salaries lower than that of FormScape's.</p>

    <title>Father Christmas</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy lost his top box today from the back of his bike. He went to the post office, once arrived he found it had gone!</p><p>We went over to Farnborough to look for some floor tiles for the kitchen, then on to Redfields garden centre to see Father Christmas where we met up with Karen, Ellie, Michael and Joey.</p><p>Mr F.C. turned up in a horse drawn sleigh with a couple of elves and Mother Christmas. He was the most realistic Father Christmas we have seen for a while.</p><p>We de-camped to Karen's for a cup of tea before returning home with the Elders for a fry up. Susan and Graham came around later in the afternoon and the kids went out to play in the big puddle outside the house.</p>

    <title>Softalk, Motorbike Woes</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        Last Friday 5pm, I got a call to say I've got the job at<a href="http://www.softalkltd.com">Softalk</a>. First day was good, although the travelling was a nightmare. Biking to Maidenhead on a Monday morning took over an hour. They are not so flexible with working hours here so not too sure how Daddy can get round this. Anyway Daddy is into my first task which is to provide an "Install Shield" type installer so they can get certified on Windows. Urrghh! Still it's refreshing to get into something new and a blank canvas so to speak. Also Daddy doesn't need to bug anyone too much.
      </p><p>Some of the people there were a bit 'holier than now'. 'Customers are stupid' type attitude and small snipes at each other. I thought I was working with a bunch of women. The two owners, Simon and Stuart are very nice and very much into the business. You can feel the stress from them for the company to do as well as possible. When I say 'stress' I probably mean focused which I like.</p><p>Bear with me, this is related..... anyway over the weekend the top box on my bike fell off without trace! So Daddy bought a new one on eBay and to cut a long story short he went to collect it from the bloke straight after work...... From Hastings!!!!!! It took 3 hours to get down there, this wasn't helped when I ran out of petrol on the M4 by Slough. Didn't get home last night until 11pm! So after another 1 hour+ trip into work on Tuesday morning in the rain Daddy felt slightly jaded.</p><p>Still raining in the evening travelling home and the fuse blew twice for my headlights. It was pitch black and Daddy didn't have another spare fuse, so had to revert to his old trick of tailgating cars in order to see where to go! Had to do this from the other side of Bracknell. Didn't get home until 7pm.</p><p>Wednesday the fun and games with the bike deepened when on the way home the fuse went again, but also the starter fuse went so I had no power. RAC came out, and had a go at fixing it by the Fighting Cocks pub, Bagshot, where there were several fights going on. Anyway he couldn't fix the problem, so called a tow truck out and finally got home at 11:30pm.</p><p>Thursday was spent getting the bike sorted. Found a really good / useful bike repairer in Aldershot which was satisfying. They sorted me out for £180.</p><p>Then Friday.... well wait for the next diary entry for that one. All in all a very horrible week up till Thursday. Weather, job and motorbike.</p>

    <title>Lily Marie Elder Born</title>
    <info>
		<p>We got a call from Ellie at about 8pm to say that her waters had broken and that they were going to hospital. Michael brought Joey around to sleep.</p><p>Ellie had a couple of mini-contractions on the way over so it was close. In fact she gave birth to Lily at 10pm, with just gas and air. Lilly arrived fit and at a healthy 8lbs. Ellie was fine although a little tired. Lilly latched on straight away and was a hungry girl.</p><p>Congratulations to Michael, Ellie and Joey for bringing us a little niece and cousin into the world.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_12_01-09a-LillyBorn.jpg</src><caption>Lily kicking and screaming</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_12_01-12-LillyBorn.jpg</src><caption>Lily having a snooze</caption></image>

    <title>Visiting Lily</title>
    <info>
		<p>We met Ma Ma and Pop Pop at Woking pool to go swimming. We had lunch first in the cafe and then went in. Ben loved it, because he could run around the edge, neither Katie, Ben or Joey liked the wave machine, and Joey was the only one who liked the flume.</p><p>In the late afternoon we went to see Lily for the first time and she was gorgeous. Looks so much like Auntie Ellie with the softest skin in the world. Auntie Charlotte stayed the night and we stopped off for a takeaway pizza which was a treat for Katie.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_12_02-28-LillyBirth.jpg</src><caption>Katie with Lily</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_12_02-23-LillyBirth.jpg</src><caption>Weston Family Line-up</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_12_02-27a-LillyVisit.jpg</src><caption>The Photography Team</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_12_02-28a-LillyVisit.jpg</src><caption>Ben Model Posing</caption></image>

    <title>Off Your Trolley</title>
    <info>
		<p>As Usual we were doing our food shopping in the supermarket. Ben sitting in the trolley seat, Katie helping (or is it dictating?) Mummy pick what items to buy this week. All of a sudden a big crash, bang, wallop as Katie decided to climb the side of the trolley. Katie, Ben and the trolley went tumbling to one side on to the floor! Screams, cries and an upset Mummy. People crowded around, fussing and offering assistance. Although sweet, we just wanted as little fuss as possible and to slip out of the supermarket unnoticed. Oh yes, no one was hurt fortunately. Initial shock caused the screams and crying.</p>

		<p>In the morning we went to Camberley to do even more Christmas shopping!</p><p>It was Ella's 4th birthday (well on Monday really) and we were invited to her party at Fizzy Kids in North Camp. This is a softplay area. Daddy enjoyed getting stuck in the ball pool. The children just ganged up on him. He sought refuge with Benny Boy in the under 4's area! It was pretty manic and Katie was whizzing around the place. The kids absolutely loved it. The afternoon was polished off nicely with a party meal and finally cake and a goody bag.</p><p>In the evening Mummy and Daddy made a start on the hundred or so presents that need wrapping. Wow I think this year is a record. Daddy is well chuffed having sorted out most of his presents.</p>

Beautiful Roast Pork! Scrummy.</p><p>Auntie Susan and Graham were also there and we got to open our first Christmas presents of the year. Katie was so excited and wanted to open everyone’s. She really enjoyed getting presents. Still a bit young for Ben.</p><p>Anyway Katie got a lovely wooden castle where she and mummy re-enacted the story where the prince turns into a frog... Can't remember the name of the story now!</p><p>Ben got some Lego which I think Graham should have received going on the enthusiasm he showed for it!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_12_10-10a-FarsXmasLunch.jpg</src><caption>Katie and Farmor Meow</caption></image>

Our prized "Katie Baby" Bauball had broke!</p><p>Anyway Daddy took a half day from work and met up with us and Joey for a little trip down the Basingstoke Canal to see Father Christmas. We got off the boat and searched for his hut through the woods. Katie followed the tinsel trail to Father Christmas's hut. Joey at this point bawled his eyes out.</p><p>In the evening Daddy met up with his old colleagues from FormScape to have a natter and a few Christmas drinks.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_12_14-06-CanalSantaKatie.jpg</src><caption>Katie with another Father Christmas</caption></image>

    <first name="katie">Katie's Nativity Play</first>
    <info>
		<p>Katie, for some reason wanted to be a 'star' in her first ever play. She said she was a 'star' before she was even given the role. Anyway we were called in from the Christmas Fair. Farfar and Great Grandma and Grandad also managed to make it.</p><p>After selling 35 sacks of reindeer food in the Christmas Fair, we trundled across to the playschool hall where there were loads of parents and grandparents looking proudly on at their offspring.</p><p>Katie had a small role at the back of the group of children. She stood up with 2 other stars and briefly twinkled her fingers in front of her. Mummy and Daddy were so proud of her. She was so concentrated and into the play and kept looking across at her entourage proudly. She sang all the songs. Honestly our hearts melted.</p><p>The performance overall lasted 10 minutes which Daddy managed to video all. Afterwards the cast sang Jingle Bells and Father Christmas danced in and handed presents. Again Katie was very well behaved and waited patiently for her turn. She managed to bump into another girl on the way up fall over. Dusted herself down, politely took the present from F.C., posed for a photo and came over for a cuddle. A lovely morning.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_12_15-07-KatieNativity.jpg</src><caption>Whose A Star?</caption></image><p>In the afternoon Daddy went to see the guys at CNL for a quick rundown on what he will be initially tasked with. It will be initially get used to the product, basically bug fixing, although this will include learning VB.NET. After a month or so Daddy will be moving onto learning ASP.NET and helping provide a web front end to the IP Security Product.</p>

    <title>Our Christmas Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>Numbers were down this year for our annual Christmas Party. Just Karen, Richard, Helen, Nigel and Ellie. A sign of the times I think. We didn't even hear back from Vicky. Maybe she is going the same way as Jessica and losing touch with us.</p><p>Anyhow we had a good time with the usual games, the usual attempts to cheat from the boys and slightly alternative buffet of hot dogs, bacon and crispy duck!</p><p>It was great to see everyone together, especially Helen and Nigel who travelled along way.</p>

We weren't allowed to call it a 'Pantomime' as somehow Katie has been told that is scary! Instead it was a 'show'.</p><p>We got to our seats, which were right near the front and settled down. The room darkened and Katie had to sit on Mummy's lap. The Peter Pan production began and we were impressed by the stage and acting. We enjoyed it lots. Katie was gripped.</p><p>The first half seemed to last about an hour, and the Frimley Green Pre-School got a mention from one of the actresses. We had some sweets and drink at half time before returning. A little way into it Capt. Hook was about to hook one of the goodies! Katie got all scared and started crying and wanted to go home. Fortunately we were patient enough with her and managed to watch it till it's conclusion.</p><p>We returned back to the Fars for a cup of tea and a little play. Ben initially cried when we had left him, but was very happy to be playing with Farmor and Farfar.</p>

		<p>Mummy Katie and Ben went to stay with Ma Ma and Pop Pop for a couple of days. While we were there Mummy left Katie and Ben with Ma Ma while she went to Bluewater shopping centre to get some last presents with Auntie Charlotte. It was very busy. In the evening Mummy and Ma Ma went out for dinner with Auntie Karen and Rose.</p>

    <title>Last Day at Softalk</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today was my last of my 4 week stint at Softalk. I can say I'm happy to leave. The past week has been murderous not only in the journey into work, where my gloves and jacket had ice on it where it was so cold, but the work itself was dull, dull, dull! Still I don't blame Softalk. They needed some work doing and I was there to do it. I owed them after mucking them around. Still I left unceremoniously, and it's all experience and makes me less scared of leaving a company if it should need to happen again. Not like FormScape where I just didn't do it, because I've not had to really do it before. It has made me think I'm not a one company man.</p><p>Onto the next position at CNL. Not nearly enough holiday time. Not enough preparation.</p>

		<p>Mummy was trying to break the record for going to church. Three times today! Some sort of religious thing must be happening! The weather wasn't great today, an between praying sessions we were allowed to play on the swings which was good fun. Katie and Ben are really starting to play with each other now... and nicely to.</p><p>Daddy cooked a traditional Danish Christmas Meal. Roast Pork, caramelized potatoes, red cabbage and veg. Auntie Susan and Graham came over to eat with us as well.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_12_24-13a-XmasEve.jpg</src><caption>Traditional Danish Christmas Meal</caption></image><p>After Dinner the main event began with the Present opening. Katie was extremely excited. She was very good and handed some of the presents out. Just ones to and from Susan and Graham.</p><p>It was nice to open presents on Christmas Eve when it's all dark outside, just before bed.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_12_24-16a-XmasEve.jpg</src><caption>Opening Presents with Susan and Graham</caption></image><p>We sprinkled reindeer food on the path and hoped Father Christmas wouldn't get stuck in our chimney.

    <title>Christmas Day</title>
    <info>
		<p>6am and Father Christmas had been. We all went into Katie's room and the three wheeled pushchair 'Just like Auntie Ellie's' was unwrapped. 'Just what I needed. It’s not too big, or not too small, just perfect' commented Katie in an excited voice. Apparently the suitcase which came next was also 'just what I needed'. Katie must have been exceptionally good as Father Christmas had delivered her loads of presents.</p><p>Ben also did very well, although was too young to appreciate it. This has to be the first year that Katie did kind of appreciate what she was given.... as much as children do.</p><p>We then sat on Mummy and Daddy's bed to see what they had been given. Katie opened most of these presents.</p><p>After breakfast, we moved on to the presents under the tree, which were all from friends. Katie hadn't lost her enthusiasm and was very happy to pass to presents out. She got a lovely pair of pink boots from Auntie Karen which she was particularly fond of.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_12_25-03a-XmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Morning Presents</caption></image><p>8:30 and we were ready to leave for Ma Ma and Pop Pops. Straight off to yet another church service at St Nicolas.</p><p>The BIG Christmas lunch was BIG. Turkey, three stuffing’s, sprouts with Chestnuts, roast potatoes and probably a lot more which I cannot remember. Well we all failed to get through half of what was on the plate.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2006/2006_12_25-22a-XmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Weston Present Opening</caption></image><p>After, the now traditional, walk around the block, we began on the mammoth Weston present giving. Lots of lovely presents.</p>

    <title>Canterbury and Boxing Day Barnett Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>Although pretty cold, we travelled eastwards to Canterbury to wander about. Starting at the Norman castle we raced up the tor, Katie won. We continued along the wall and into the town.</p><p>We toured the Cathedral for quite some time.... It was pretty interesting, well Ben fell asleep, but we marvelled at the size of the place and secret rooms and side chapels. We had a pizza before returning to the tor for a spot of fun in the children's maze which had a slide in the middle as a prize.</p><p>We returned to Istead Rise in time for the Barnett Boxing Day party.</p>

    <info>
		<p>After ferrying the kids around shops for the past 2 days, we devoted the day to what they wanted to do. Katie decided swimming, and we think that Woking is the best place as it has a shallow bit, and a double small pool with slide, a Jacuzzi and a show flume, a lazy river and it's not too expensive or packed out.</p><p>Charlotte came over to stay the night and we watched Sense and Sensibility in the evening. Exactly the same as Pride and Prejudice!</p>

    <title>Fars and New Years Eve Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>After church and lunch we visited the Fars after their return from Copenhagen. Farfar had set a big train track upstairs which spanned three rooms. It was hard to say who enjoyed it the most, Farfar, Daddy, Katie or Ben. Ben wasn't as interested as I thought he would be. Katie on the other hand played with it for quite some time.</p><p>An impromptu party had been organised at our house for New Years Eve. The Elders thought it best not to hold it this year as Lily celebrates midnight every night... if you know what I mean.</p><p>The Fars, Great Grandad, Great Grandma and Uncle Peter came over for some Mummy style quizzes and food. We played Family Fortunes, Mr and Mrs, Rapidough and Millionaire. We drank and ate our way till midnight and sang the customary Old Lang Syne.</p><p>Katie and Ben slept through.</p>

		<p>The morning was spent clearing up after last night's gathering and taking down the decs.</p><p>In the afternoon we met with the Elders at a particularly muddy Farnham park and played on the swings. Katie liked the ariel slide loads. We then later went to Alton to swap presents and try some of the fountain of chocolate.</p>

		<b>Sleeping</b><p /><ul><li>I am such a good sleeper. From an early age I have been able to be put down in the evening about 6:30/7pm awake.

I've developed a really nice smile.</li><li>I get into temper tantrums, when I get upset sometimes.

    <title>First Week At CNL, Kitchen</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        Three hard days at<a href="http://www.cnluk.com">CNL</a>this week. There are two areas which I need to quickly get up to speed:
      </p><ul><li>The Product, IPSecurityCenter (which I will be working on)</li><li>VB.NET, the programming language I will be developing in</li></ul><p>Neither of the above I have any experience in. So I have set out a rough plan for the next 4 weeks in which I will be following. So far I have dipped my toes into both and am quite enjoying both. The product hasn't yet been released and is a bit rough around the edges in places. Quite a few bugs I have found. VB.NET, Visual Studio 2005 and Team Foundation Server on the other hand look interesting enough to get into. Well it's the latest stuff so will look great on my CV if nothing else. My biggest hurdle is to pass the three month probation period. There was a chap who left in December because he didn't make the grade. Just got to really make sure I don't fall the same way.</p><p>Anyway I'm working with 4 other developers + the development boss and two commissioning guys (install systems into companies). I've got 20 inch wide screen flat panels and 2 gig memory. Complete builds are completed within a minute or two, which is great. At FormScape they would take 4 hours.</p><p>Still trying to muster the enthusiasm to do some work at home. I'm not sure why I am not. I think when I get home I just get lazy / can't be bothered. Still they do work hard at CNL. 8:30am to 6pm, with a little lunch break are my typical hours at the moment.</p><p>A bad couple of days on the shares this week.... Really bad!!! 2 big'uns down in 2 days.</p><p>Finally after a couple of days man effort the new kitchen floor is down and looks very much the last one. We had a bit of a panic when we got too low a quality tile! The tiler had to go home Thursday and come back Friday! Ooops. Mummy's recent splash out:</p><ul><li>Kitchen floor</li><li>Kitchen table</li><li>Wooden toy box</li><li>Front room rug</li><li>Front room lights</li><li>Bathroom cabinet</li><li>Fridge freezer</li><li>Carpet and sofa cleaning</li></ul><p>Hopefully now she has stopped and Daddy can recover from 'open wallet surgery'!</p>

    <info>
		<p>Rain, rain, rain go away. Well it's pretty difficult to get out of the house when it's cold, wet and windy.</p><p>After a splash around in the puddles in the road (getting totally soaked), we went over to the soft play in Fleet. We had great fun on the trolley runs.</p><p>We popped over to the West household for a cup of tea. Barrie's latest money making scheme involves them living in a caravan for a while. Needless to say we had to rib him about that!</p><p>In the evening Ben went to bed whilst the rest of us watched Ice Age. We have to be very careful with Katie that nothing too bad happens in the film... well it all has a happy ending.</p>

		<p>Daddy went to visit the Fars whilst the rest of us went to (boring) church!</p><p>After a nice Sunday lunch, we drove to Green Park and caught the tube to Westminster. 'Big Ben' met 'Little Ben' as we crossed the Thames over to see the London Eye and walk along the South Bank. Ben and Katie were loving it. They stopped and danced by a busker which was a site to be seen. It put a smile on some passersby anyway. After a heavy tip (a pound), we continued up steps, Katie's favourite, along Hungerford Bridge and eventually onto Trafalgar Square.</p><center><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/n6EjgnRgEBU&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/n6EjgnRgEBU&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object></center><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_01_07-08-London.jpg</src><caption>The Bens</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_01_07-18-London.jpg</src><caption>Ben and Katie Loving It On The South Bank</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_01_07-24-London.jpg</src><caption>A busker and his two dancers</caption></image><p>We caught a double decker and passed Piccadilly Circus, up Regent Street seeing all the lights. Mummy and Katie almost fell down the steps on the way out. We had a short walk along a street with a load of really posh shops back to the car.</p>

    <title>Ten Pin Bowling - Special Needs Lady</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today Caroline and Henry rang up and wondered if we fancied going to Farnborough ten pin bowling. We had a whale of a time there. Katie got a strike and a spare and wore special shoes and a pink 6lb ball. Ben also managed a couple of goes as well.</p><p>There was a group of special needs people there which Katie noticed and didn't say anything about at the time. 10 hours later at bed time she asked</p><ul><li><i>Katie</i>Why did that lady have big cheeks?
        </li><li><i>Mummy</i>Which lady?
        </li><li><i>Katie</i>The lady at bowling
        </li><li><i>Mummy</i>She's a special lady
        </li><li><i>Katie</i>I'm not special, nor are you mummy because we haven't got big cheeks.
        </li><li><i>Mummy</i>No, we're all special for one reason or another.
        </li></ul><p>Ben is attempting to say a few words now, although it's still not coming out quite right. He's not so interested in books, but is more analytical and can play by himself a lot more. We're not worried about his lack of speech but we are all getting frustrated at times that he cannot express himself clearly. At the moment he loves going into the toy box and using it as a boat. He's also well into cars, trains and motorbikes. However, he's also into Katie's pushchairs and necklaces.</p>

    <title>Bournemouth Pipes</title>
    <info>
		<p>Illness struck the household this week. Mummy felt a bit sicky and coldy, as did Katie and Ben to a lesser extent. So lots of early nights.</p><p>Daddy has also had a bit of a rollercoaster ride at his new work. His new 'project' requires knowledge in a number of new areas. Kind of building blocks.</p><ul><li>VB.NET</li><li>ASP.NET 2</li><li>Telerik Controls (+dynamic creation and AJAX support)</li></ul><p>
        The VB.NET I believe I have picked up enough quite quickly. Got used to the syntax. The thing is to get into the supported classes and features that are thrown in. ASP.NET has had a number of significant jumps since the original version which I last looked at. So much richer in terms of controls and structure. Then
        <a href="http://www.telerik.com">
          Telerik
        </a>
        , which is a 3rd party provider of ASP.NET 2 controls which allows you to design website that look more like a normal windows app. At the beginning of the week I was finding a number of concepts and combination hard to grasp. However, after a bit more playing and reading all is a bit clearer now, and my boss reviewed my progress and was happy enough with it. Phew. I was doubting myself as a software engineer for a while. Still got to work hard at it though. If it all comes off it will be very rewarding for me, using the latest technologies competently.
      </p><p>It was a cold crisp January day. Last minute, we decided to go and visit Bournemouth. Ben and Katie rather optimistically took their buckets and spades. We parked at the top of the cliffs and walked down to the beach area. We could see pipes all along the beach. Weird. Perhaps it's the Russians extending their oil pipeline!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_01_20-02-Bournemouth.jpg</src><caption>Katie admiring the pipes</caption></image><p>The pier was also shut so we wandered into the busy town and looked for some new work clothes and shoes for Daddy. A bit of a culture shock as CNL require smart-casual dress rather than casual!</p><p>After our picnic we went back to the beach to dig holes and build sand castles and try and cover up the leaks from the pipes.</p><p>We all went to throw stones into the sea. Unfortunately the tide was coming in and Benny is not quite that quick on his feet. The tide came rushing in, Benny turned, fell on his bum and then got a very wet bottom! Oh dear. We all had a laugh and Ben was marched back to the car to get changed whilst Daddy and Katie played in the sand and on the pipes.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_01_20-11-Bournemouth.jpg</src><caption>Danger, Danger, Danger. Explosives!!</caption></image><p>We went back via the zig-zag to the car and popped in to the Elders for a cup of tea and to see Joey's green paint explosion!</p>

		<p>We woke up to snow this morning which was a surprise to us all. Katie and Ben were really excited. We made a snowman and threw a few snowballs in the back garden.</p><p>After Daddy went to work we went to Frimley Green hill and went sledging. Katie had no fear going down. Ben wanted to be on his own</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_01_24-04-KatieBenSnow.jpg</src><caption>Katie sledging</caption></image>

    <title>Katie Ballet Lesson</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie had her first ballet lesson today, she was so excited even though I don't think she even knows what ballet is. Katie really enjoyed it skipping and marching around the room and pretending to be a butterfly. She went with her friend Poppy. She is desperate for some ballet shoes now, which hopefully we can buy next week.</p>

    <title>Police Statement, Katie Away For Weekend, Camberley Obelisk</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning PC Flint came around to take a statement and I asked whether Daddy wished to press charges against the kids who stole our MP3 player from the letter box. The delivery firm posted the package only half way through the letterbox and these known criminals just took it out. Luckily there was a witness.</p><p>Ma Ma and Pop Pop took our baby away for the weekend :( Wow. I think it is the first time she has spent a night away from us. Katie was not phased at all. In fact she was looking forward to it all week and when Mummy and Daddy teased her about coming to, she was quite adamant that they were not allowed to go! Makes us feel really loved and wanted! It would be a good experience for her to be away from Mummy especially. Independence and all that.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_01_27-01-KatieLeavingHome.jpg</src><caption>Katie Away For The Weekend</caption></image><ul><li><i>Katie At Ma Ma and Pop Pop</i>Left Mummy and Bennyboo at The Star and went off with Ma Ma and Pop Pop to Godstone Farm Park. Was a little shy to begin with but soon settled in and started to have fun. The farm was great and I saw rabbits, guinea pigs, goats, sheep, cows, mice, chickens, llamas, and a large pig (Ma Ma was surprised when I called him Far Far - but I was only joking).
        </li><li>Next we went to have something to eat - Ma Ma had a coffee (which was naughty because she is off caffeine at the moment) and Pop Pop had a tea. I had a lolly which was lovely. Next we headed for the play barn. The best bit of all was the little caravan which Ma Ma and I played in for absolutely ages. We loved it and we want someone to make me one for my garden!!!! Ma Ma would not come on the softplay because she had a skirt on (so what I ask?) I think she was silly to wear a skirt anyway. Soon it was time to leave and we set off for Pop Pop's favourite place on earth - Bluewater.</li><li>As we arrived I gave Ma Ma a sly look and said "Can I have another pair of shoes?" (Last time we came I got a pair) Of course she said yes, as I knew she would. However, once inside the Mall I spotted some fantastic balloons. I couldn't believe it because when I asked if I could have one Ma Ma said it had to be either the shoes OR the balloon - I ask you how mean is that! Anyway I chose the balloon.</li><li>We had a spot of lunch (I had crisps hee hee) and then went down to the stable where Ma Ma rides each week. Tikki is lovely and I got to ride her round the stable yard with Ma Ma. I was so brave I even brushed her. While Ma Ma rode, Pop Pop and I went To Toys R Us  where I played with all the toys (what a surprise!). Once we were back at Ma Ma and Pop Pop's we played loads of games and had tea (sausages and baked beans for me - yum) and then after watching "You've Been framed" and reading a few books I went to bed. Ma Ma said I was a real fidget but I don't believe her!  (Thanks to Ma Ma and Pop Pop for this entry)</li></ul><p>
        Meanwhile, Mummy and Daddy took Benny out for a nice go on the playground and for a walk up to
        <a href="http://www.surreyheath.gov.uk/leisure/LeisureActivitiesinSurreyHeath/obelisk.htm">
          Camberley Obelisk
        </a>
        . It has quite a history behind it, but it has seen better days. Anyway Ben really enjoyed the attention from both parents. He loved walking up the hill and going on the swings. It was so, so much easier and quieter handling just one of our offspring and we had the energy and time to muck around with him properly. What a difference there is between having one and two children to look after. Before Katie gets upset, we of course missed her very much, although when asked whether she wanted to ring us up in the evening apparently she responded with 'no, I'll do it later.' Charming!

		<ul><li><i>Katie At Ma Ma and Pop Pop</i>Ma Ma and Pop got up early because Ma Ma's next door neighbours came in to fix the tank. I read loads of books with Ma Ma and then we went to church. I did some colouring and things at the back. After a lovely lunch we drove back home and I was reunited with my darling mummy, daddy and Bennyboo.  (Thanks to Ma Ma and Pop Pop for this entry)
        </li></ul><p>In the afternoon Katie arrived back at home with Ma Ma and Pop Pop staying for a cup of tea. Later in the afternoon the Fars came around and were at the end of Katie's and Ben's exuberance.</p>

    <title>Joey's and Freya's Birthday Parties</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went Joey's 2nd birthday celebration which was jointly held with a girl born on the same day, Isabella. It was held in a function room at the country market near Frensham. There was lots of space and toys to play with. About 20 kids played 'parcel parcel' (as Katie calls it). A lovely buffet and a trip at the end to the adjoining fish shop. Live fish, which Katie, Ben and Joey all enjoyed.</p><p>We then rushed over to Freya's party which was being hosted at Wizzy World. Ben and Katie loved playing in the cage. We had another game of pass the parcel and musical bumps. By the end of the day I think the children were worn out... not to mention the parents! We ended the day by watching out favourite 'You’ve Been Framed'.</p>

    <title>Daddy To Denmark</title>
    <info>
		<p>6am and the Fars are waiting outside for Daddy who is still asleep in bed! Martin, you're parents are waiting outside. Arrgghh. Got to pack toiletries, get dressed, put laptop into bag, batteries, take out razor, oh and find passport! Oh well we made it to Gatwick in time and the check in process all went quite smoothly. Not much queuing at all.</p><p>Daddy and Farmor were going to see Oldemor to help celebrate her 90th birthday. It was a cloudy day so grabbing a window seat only proved an advantage for about 20 seconds before we were immersed in cotton wool. The plane was just half full. Farmor had sneaked on a cheese sandwich to eat as we weren't going to pay extortionate prices for 'cardboard and fruit'.</p><p>Arriving at the airport we stepped out to a fine, sunny day. We made our way to Kongens Nytorv and the classy Magasin department store. We reached the top floor, secured a window seat and watched over the circulating ice skaters as we delicately scoffed smorbrød and a tiny øl (well a pint of Tuborg).</p><p>We Metro’ed, trained and bussed our way to see Oldemor at her home about 10 miles outside Copenhagen.</p><p>Oldemor was in fine spirits and sat chirping away. She still appears vacant at times, but the pleasing thing is that she still has a sense of humour and is well. The same revolving, small talk questions were answered in the same patient manner. Oldemor's daily schedule is, breakfast, then a midday lunch, followed by a sleep from 1pm to 3pm, then dinner at 6pm and bedtime at 7 or 8 o'clock. She has a number of pills, one for sedation, another for her heart and a number of vitamin and iron supplements.</p><p>It was nice for the 3 of us to sit together in her front room decorated with pictures of the English contingent and her old furniture. We had some coffee and of course Oldemor was dishing out the sweets and taking a few for herself. We read and chatted until 6pm when it was 'liver stew' time. :(</p><p>Farmor and Daddy joined in with this meal. It was pretty quiet amongst the 15 or so inmates. Some seemed very able to get about and knew what they were doing. The 100 year old looked remarkable and was helping some of her younger comrades from their seats. There was a married couple both in wheelchairs which was very sweet. Somehow I can't imagine Laura and I ever being in a home together in later years. I think we will have argued ourselves to our coffins before we get to that stage!</p><p>Wishing Oldemor a good night, Farmor and Daddy went off to the city centre to 'paint the town red'. Rip it up so to speak. Well it was blooming cold, at -3 degrees, with a stiff wind. After exploring the cinema we decided to head for a bar and have an expensive drink. It still amazes me how quiet the city is. Where is everyone? What are they doing? We returned home to have some pastries and a catch up of the news on BBC World, before settling down to the World Service for the night!</p><p>Daddy went to Denmark so Auntie Charlotte came to stay as mummy doesn't like being on her own in the house. We went to Poppy's birthday party at Fizzy Kids then on to see Great Grandma and Grandad. In the evening Auntie Charlotte had a party so we went to stay at Auntie Ellie's. We all had a great time. Pizza for tea, then a play and then all in the bath together (not Lilly though). Mummy put Katie and Ben to bed in Auntie Ellie's bed but when she went to get Ben to put him in the travel cot she couldn't find him in the bed or on the floor. She panicked of course but found him snuggled up asleep in the corner of the bedroom, Mummy doesn't know how he got there! Mummy and Katie slept on the put me up.</p>

    <title>From minus 2 to 50 degrees - Charlotte To Stay</title>
    <info>
		<p>A late riser this morning. Oldemor isn't usually too great in the mornings and today was no different. She gets a bit short and feisty with all of us, including the other in-mates. Could barely get a decent word from her.</p><p>We left her for lunch, as we went off to Fredericksberg for swimming. It was extremely cold, snow in the air. The pool didn't seem to be much warmer! Such a common activity, but so differently done in Denmark. Cleanliness and nudity seem order of the day.</p><p>After a sauna, pølser and a chocolate, we returned to the home to find Oldemor in a much better mood. Such a relief. Farmor left for a bit leaving me to have a nice chat on my own with Oldemor. I remarked how clever she was for knitting. She even had a go on the computer! Oldemor thought I looked 40!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_02_12-09-DaddyInDenmark.jpg</src><caption>Oldemor and Farmor In Confab</caption></image><p>We went to church then Auntie Charlotte came back very tired and we went to look for some marbles for Katie in Camberley. Every time Katie sleeps through the night she is going to put a marble in the jar and when she gets ten we are going to the zoo. Katie is waking up every hour in the night at the moment and is then so tired during the day. She says there is bears in her room.</p>

    <title>Return from Denmark</title>
    <info>
		<p>The last part of my trip was good. There was a bit of snow in the air, but I missed my family.</p><p>I wasn't expecting to picked up in departures, so it was a lovely surprise to see Katie and Ben running towards me all excited in their pyjamas! They were as pleased to see me as I was them. It brought a tear to my eye.</p><p>Then Laura paid for the parking, then forgot to take the ticket! So we were stuck in Gatwick's car park. I wasn't paying £30 / £40 / £50. So I scouted an escape route which involved reversing down a busy one way area, going up the curb and onto some paving. Finally had to cross on to the main ring road across another curb. Fearing from being beached, I managed to find a gap in some bollards up the road, and a few beeps later we were free!</p>

		<p>In the morning we went back to the Camberley Obelisk for a walk around and a go on the playground. We also went to get Mummy's valentine present, a pair of pyjamas. We got Katie a pair as well. We made our trips to the bakers and butchers</p><p>The afternoon was split into boys and girls. Mummy, Katie and Natasha went to see Charlotte's Web at the cinema. Katie enjoyed it, although was a bit naughty during the film as she chatted to Natasha. Meanwhile Daddy and Ben went to Wembley to see Chertsey lose 2-0. Not that Ben would know. He had severe conjunctivitis and a bout of putting the stand seats up and down, up and down!! He enjoyed himself and entertained the Chertsey supporters (as the players weren't doing it!).</p>

    <title>Hospitals , Airports and a little farm</title>
    <info>
		<p>Early in the morning Ben fell down three of our stairs and bumped his head into the stair-gate. What a bump! A big egg rose immediately. The standard reactions: Mummy panicking, stressing and shouting. Daddy laid back and not getting too involved. Mummy was paranoid enough to go down to A and E. Daddy took Katie out for a bike ride in the meantime. Mummy rushed back, having not seen a doctor because we had to go and pick Ma Ma and Pop Pop from Heathrow. They had returned from a lovely holiday in Canada. We loved to see all the big planes coming almost on top of us.</p><p>
        After Sunday lunch we smoozed down to<a href="http://www.millersark.co.uk/">Roke Farm</a>near Odiham. There was a busy open day with lots of animals to mingle with. Ben was almost brave enough to feed some sheep. They both were able to stroke, pat and poke the animals. It was fun getting in with the pigs, seeing the tiny lambs and hearing the cows mooo. Ellie, Joey and the Fars accompanied us around the farm. It was good fun.

    <title>Colchester Zoo</title>
    <info>
		<p>At the last minute we re-arranged to go to the zoo today. We saw loads of animals. Our favourites were the lions who were lazy bones, but did prowl around a bit. We were the width of the glass away from them. They are massive creatures. We saw the tigers being fed. The alligator who was dozing in the water, sprung out and quickly ran towards us. We were a bit scared. Lucky it was behind the glass. At lunchtime we stopped and played on the adventure playground. We climbed this really high scramble nets. Benny's boots fell off!</p><p>It was lunchtime for the elephants as well and Daddy fed them some carrots and cabbage. Their trunk is very rough, it was a funny feeling when they came to take the food from Daddy's hand.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_03_03-06a-ColchesterZoo.jpg</src><caption>Ben wobbling over the crocs!</caption></image><p>Katie enjoyed the Rhino's who were in a very muddy field. We also went in the water tunnel and saw the sea lions swimming all around us. We ended with a train ride through the zoo which was nice as we could rest our legs.</p>

    <title>Sunday Lunch to the Fars</title>
    <info>
		<p>After church we went to the Fars for Sunday lunch. Ben and Katie were on good form. They sat up to the table nicely and actually ate their food properly. The meal was interrupted with a big 'Parda' from Ben. He took it in his stride though and tried to get away with it as if nothing had happened. They managed to make lots of mess!</p>

    <title>Grand Union Canal - Harefield to Watford and Toy Sale</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy and Katie had a girlie trip to the N.C.T sale with Auntie Caroline and Sarah. We bought lots of clothes for Katie, ready for the summer and we bought some new puzzles and games. We also bought Ben some motorbikes.</p><p>Daddy and Ben continued their trek northwards from Harefield. The paths were reasonably muddy. We passed many boats, which Ben told Daddy of each instance... "Ba Ba". Still not sure if he enjoys it or not as he sits quite silent after the initial 10 minutes.</p><p>We passed some beautiful scenery. Rolling hills with horses, quaint 'lock' cottages and Grove Park, a nice looking mansion with a golf course surrounding it. This is where we ended our journey and turned back for the car.</p><p>On the way home on the M25 I noticed the mountain bike was hanging vertically and swinging from side to side! I quick pulled over and put the bike back properly on the rack. Not too sure how close we were to dropping the bike on the motorway.</p>

		<p>The first shorts and t-shirts day of the year. After church and Sunday roast, we headed up to Hyde Park and the pirate playground. A very busy playground.</p><p>We tried climbing the mast on the pirate ship but there was just too many people. We tried some of the less favoured playground apparatus. Ben and Katie loved the spinning bowl.</p><p>We walked to the boating lake, had an ice lolly and Katie and Daddy braved the cold stream at Princess Diana's memorial.</p><p>We continued in a loop passed some fountains and finally back to the car.</p>

    <title>Mother's Day song</title>
    <info>
		<p>All the mummy’s were invited into Katie's playschool to watch the children sing some songs for Mother's day. There was three songs about spring which were excellent and one about being good for our Mummy's. Mummy managed to get a seat right at the front and right opposite Katie and it was wonderful. Katie sang all the songs and was really good. Then each child had to take their Mummy's to see the painting they had drew of them. Katie had painted me big and orange with a green face and what mummy thought was green hair but Katie said was actually a green hat. Then Katie gave Mummy some daffodils and a lovely card she had made. What a nice morning!</p>

    <title>Chicken Pox and Plane Spotting</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ben is into his third day of chicken pox which he caught a week or so earlier from Joey. Poor little might has not been sleeping well at night, been off his food, clingy to mummy and been a bit itchy. However, other than that he has long spells where you wouldn't know any different.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_03_17-12-Ben.jpg</src><caption>Chicken Pox Ben</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_03_21-KatieBenNursing.jpg</src><caption>Katie looking after Ben</caption></image><p>In the morning we ran some errands and Daddy took Katie to the army swing park. We completed the assault course without the crocodiles getting us.</p><p>In the afternoon we went plane spotting as when we came back past Heathrow last week Katie and Ben loved watching the planes coming into land. We parked up and joined the other 'Normans'. Katie got into to so much she started taking down the nationalities of each of the planes. She can name a few countries now from it!</p><p>Ben has developed a few cute noises to signify things he wants:</p><ul><li><i>Woo Ooo</i>train
        </li><li><i>rarrrr</i>Lion
        </li><li><i>-snor sounds-</i>I want to go to sleep
        </li><li><i>-clicking noise-</i>I want some food

    <info>
		<p>Ben and Katie got mummy a pose of flowers each and a double decker chocolate bar. Katie managed to write her name in a card. It wasn't too comprehendible unless you were shown what she was trying to do.</p><p>After church we popped over to the Fars for a cup of tea and the mess the place up. We told them the news of Mummy being pregnant. They were very happy.</p><p>At lunchtime we went to The Surrey, St John’s where we joined the Weston and Elders and had sausage and chips. There was a nice play area outside where we got Daddy, Uncle Michael and  Joey out to play as well. Katie liked jumping off one of the platforms.</p><p>Poor Lilly looked worse than Ben with her spots. She was in good form though. It was nice to play with Ma Ma also.</p><p>Katie is addicted to the CBeebies website at the moment. She is getting very good at the glide pad. Show enjoys quite a few games. She hates games that has a timer that ticks down. She is always very proud at her achievements.</p>

		<p>We headed coast bound to sunny Bournemouth. We popped into Charlotte's place in Winton for a bacon sandwich. Reminds mummy and daddy of student days gone past. Typical student house.</p><p>We parked at the top of the hill and walked down to the pier with our buckets and spades. We attempted to make a sand car, but Katie quite rightly said it wasn't as good as Karen and Richard's effort from last year!</p><p>We didn't dare go too close to the water after last times drenching accident! Katie and for the first time Ben, went trampolining. Trying to keep Ben on the one apparatus was pretty hard work. However, his funny walks and laughter was worth the trip alone.</p><p>We headed into town where Daddy surfed the surf shops and Katie treating us to some chips and later a lolly.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_03_24-06-Bournemouth.jpg</src><caption>Beach crew</caption></image>

    <title>Farfar’s Steam Train</title>

		<p>In the afternoon we headed to Alresford to see Farfar go on the Steam Train Experience. He was in the cab with two other novices and two teachers. It took about 45 minutes to be shown the ropes. Katie managed to go in the cab, but she was a bit scared I think of the 5 boiler suited strangers looking down at her reaction to being wowed in a steam train.</p><p>Farfar was in control for the first run and eventually they pulled out of the station towards Medstead. Ben liked looking at the train. I think he will be a train spotter before too long.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_03_28-04-Alresford.jpg</src><caption>Farfar driving a steam train</caption></image><p>Whilst Farfar was travelling along, Ellie, Joseph, Lilly and the rest of us went along the Millennium trail around Alresford. There was a gorgeous looking thatched roof house that bridged the river. Lovely.</p><p>We returned to the station. However, Farfar had not returned. We went off to Ellie's for a cup of tea and to mess her house up!</p><p>In the evening Daddy watched a pitiful England performance against Andorra. It was the first in the series of the Apprentice also!</p>

    <title>Mummy to playschool, PDC Darts</title>
    <info>
		<p>After Katie had put her foot down the toilet - goodness only knows why, Mummy went to help out for the morning at Katie's pre-school. It was great. Katie wouldn't let any other children play with her Mummy though, but it was great to see what Katie does there. She is so good and listens to the stories and joins in all the songs. Mummy was so proud of her. Katie made an Easter cake and did a little egg hunt, We had great fun together.</p><p>Meanwhile the boys went off to do 'man' things. B and Q first stop. Get some sand for the sandpit, look at BBQs and hooks and flowers! Ben loved going in the trolley. He was chillin' in there.</p><p>Next stop Longacre, then onto to see Farmor at her school. Ben managed to play in the hall and even go on one of the musical instruments.</p><p>Tiring work, Ben had a kip as we went over to pick Mummy and Katie up. After lunch we went over to Oliver’s to play, then onto ballet.</p><p>In the evening Daddy went over to Reading to watch the PDC darts league with the boys. Noticed everyone slowing down in the drinking stakes these days. Even Nick. Finally got home at midnight.</p>

    <title>Brooks Farm, Discover Centre, Canary Wharf</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        We had an early start on this sunny day. We circled around the M25 to Leyton and visited an inner city farm,
        <a href="http://www.lbwf.gov.uk/index/leisure/childrens-activities/brooks-farm-leyton.htm">
          Brooks Farm
        </a>
        . Before entering we went on a playground which was a bit different. There were monkey and parrot swings and this wicked roundabout which Daddy spun as quickly as he could. 'Again, again' from both Ben and Katie. I think they preferred to stay there rather than go in the farm.
      </p><p>The farm was being tended to by local children. Real EastEnders! There were goats, chickens, horses and even a Farfar (oink, oink). We managed to buy some eggs once the 15year old had finished her fag!</p><p>
        We travelled south down to Stratford where we went into a place called
        <a href="http://www.discover.org.uk/index.php">
          Discover For Children
        </a>
        . We didn't quite know what to expect, it was an 'experience' for children. Anyway it was a fun place, where there were stepping stones which played cool sounds, a craft area, a story telling area. Katie sang twinkle, twinkle little star, which was recorded and played for all to hear. There were dens, a video wall and mirrors to draw on.
      </p><p>We spent well over an hour in there before Mummy whisked us out into the sunshine and the adjoining playground. Katie took Ben on the slide!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_03_31-23a-StratfordLeyton-KatieBen.jpg</src><caption>Slippery Slide</caption></image><p>We then caught the Docklands Railway to see some big building at Canary Wharf. Ben and Katie loved waiting at Stratford station watching mainline trains and underground trains go by. All the characters from Underground Ernie were mentioned.</p><p>Half way through our journey about half a dozen, real EastEnders sat around us. One with a pit-bull. The language was pretty fowl, even with their best efforts to avoid bad language. 'Careful there's two babies next to ya'. Mummy and Daddy laughed and thought it was quite sweet that they at least tried.</p><p>We got off at Canary Wharf, an impressive station. 'Daddy, you love your buildings don't you?'. We could eat her up sometimes. We walked around all the tall buildings, seeing if we could see the tops of them.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_03_31-31-StratfordLeyton-KatieBen.jpg</src><caption>All the tall buildings</caption></image><p>Ben's love for buses meant we had to go back on the D8. We went in the wrong direction at first, but finally got the right bus back to Stratford. Katie was appalled at all the litter and the writing on the seat of the bus. 'People are naughty. Naughty, naughty, naughty. We're not naughty are we Daddy?'. I think Katie pointed every bit of litter out on the streets of the east end. It had sent Ben to sleep.</p><p>We returned home by driving through central London, seeing the London Eye and Big Ben! Katie stopped for a wee wee outside a posh hotel in Knightsbridge before returning home for You've Been Framed!</p>

We played on the swings and pooh sticks in the stream.</p>

Great Grandad was taking pictures of a baby in the travel chair thinking it was Lily, but it was a baby doll. Easter egg on face I think.</p>

    <title>Lakeside Country Park and Another Easter Egg Hunt</title>
    <info>
		<p>Our recent steam train obsession meant that we headed south to Eastleigh and to the Lakeside Country Park. Another miniature railway with some nice steam engines. It was a good setup and a reasonably long track around some lakes. Ben absolutely loved it. Of course Farfar went up to the driver and started talking 'engines' with him. Not sure who is sadder Ben or Farfar!</p><p>We stopped off half way around to go on the swings and play hide and seek, which is Katie's favourite, even though the same hiding place was used over and over again. Sometimes Katie will play hide and seek with her dolly! She hides the dolly, then goes round like we do, saying 'Is she behind the curtains?'. Very sweet. Anyway we moved on to walk around the lakes and play Pooh sticks on one of the bridges.</p><p>Ben is still not speaking. He's moved on from making noises for certain things to making actions. For instance if you ask him to say 'cat', he'll scrunch his eyes for a second. So funny.</p><p>Anyway he demonstrated a 'cat' half way around our walk.</p><p>We returned back to the station and trained it back to the start. We stopped off for a lolly, before returning home for a late lunch and the weekly food shop.</p><p>Later in the afternoon we popped over to Farmor's again, this time for a mini Easter Egg hunt. Yep more eggs to add to the collection!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_04_09-04-Lakeside.jpg</src><caption>Ooo Ooo</caption></image>

    <title>Oldemor Passes Away, Craft Morning</title>
    <info>
		<p>At 1:30 in the morning, Oldemor passed away peacefully. She contracted a urine infection a couple of weeks previous and has never really recovered. Farmor went to see her last week and Oldemor didn't acknowledge or recognise her. So the news is not completely unexpected.</p><p>We have great comfort that she went without any pain. She reached a good age and she is now with Oldefar.</p><p>Katie was booked into an Easter craft session at the library with her friends Natasha, Grace and Nina. There was stories, singing and she made two bookmarks and an Easter basket filled with eggs. It was so lovely. We then went to Natasha's for lunch and an Easter egg hunt and a play in her garden. All the children had such a great time together.</p>

    <title>Swanley Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>We met Auntie Karen, Summer and Alice today and went to Swanley park. Katie went in the little paddling pool there, Ben was not so keen as the water was very cold. There was a great sand pit there and a swing park but Mummy was scared because it was so busy and she found it hard to make sure Ben didn't fall off anything while checking Katie was safe! We had a lovely picnic that Auntie Karen brought and an ice lolly. There was a few little merry - go- rounds which all the children really enjoyed. Ma Ma then met us and we caught the miniature train back to the car. We stayed the night at Ma Ma and Pop Pop's, all squashed into one bed. Well Mummy was squashed Katie and Ben had plenty of space!</p>

    <title>Cameron and Taylor</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went into Gravesend with Ma Ma. We saw the big ships on the Thames, Ben was fascinated by the noise they made. Ma Ma bought Katie and Ben a new Pair of shoes each and a sun hat for Ben. She also bought Mummy a pair of sandals as hers got swept away in the sea last year. We went for a McDonalds and Mummy won a free cheeseburger ! In the afternoon we went to see Mummy's cousin Joanne and her two little boys Cameron and Taylor. Cameron liked Katie and gave her some big cuddles. Both Katie and Ben loved their bunk beds. They live in a big block of flats and when we arrived there Katie said "Wow what a lot of windows Taylor has got!" She was also surprised not to find any stairs in the flat. They all got on really well and had a lovely afternoon.</p>

    <title>Daddy to Denmark, Us to Gravesend</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy went to Denmark for Oldemor’s funeral and Mummy hates staying on her own in the house so she drove us to Gravesend to stay with Ma Ma and Pop Pop. It took us three hours to get there, stuck in horrible traffic. Katie and Ben were great though, we played every game we could think off. We had tea and a bath and then straight to bed. In the morning we left early to get to playschool.</p>

    <title>Oldemor Funeral, Howards 50th</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy went with Farmor, Farfar and Susan to Denmark for Oldemor's funeral. We stayed at the old people’s home all four of us in the same room for a couple of nights.</p><p>The funeral was held just around the corner in a church in Hjortospring cemetery. It was a nice sunny day. The Danish flag was at half mast. Joan, Lise and Jørgen, Inger, Frau Vest, Vera and a red cross representative attended.</p><p>It was a lovely service. The coffin was decorated in flowers including a very special heart one from Farmor.</p><p>Afterwards we went back to Oldemor's room and had coffee and nibbles. As we have not got much scope for bringing things back to England anything that is left in Oldemor’s room will go to the Red Cross. Thankfully some of the friends took some pictures and bits so at least we know where bits have gone.</p><p>Later in the day we went for a car trip to get out and about. We hiked across Øresundsbroen, the bridge that connects Denmark with Sweden. It was a whopping £50!! Anyway we stopped off at a small village, Vellinge for a walk around. We went into a traditional Swedish off license. Man they are super strict. You have to be let in and out of the shop. The shop assistant has to go and fetch your order as you are not trusted to pick the bottles of alcohol yourself. Super Red Tape.</p><p>We returned back to Denmark and headed to the southern tip of Amager and to Dragor. It was a picture postcard town with narrow cobbled streets separating the pastel yellow houses, some thatched all of different designs. We had a nice meal at the restaurant.</p><p>On the way back to our sleeping quatres we went through the city centre and to Marinedales Vej, where Farmor grew up. They've tarted up the place quite a bit which was nice to see.</p><p>We Stayed at Auntie Ellie's tonight as Daddy is still in Denmark. Uncle Michael babysat all four of us  while Mummy and Auntie Ellie went for a meal for Uncle Howard's 50th. It was a nice evening. Mummy had a lovely burger! When we got home Mummy and Katie snuggled up on the put-me-up and Ben was in the travel cot. We got up early to get Daddy from Gatwick, which Katie and Ben loved doing and spotted some big aeroplanes.</p>

    <title>Copenhagen to Knaphill: A Commute From Hell</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy had to return back to work this morning from the old people’s home.</p><p>Farfar woke us too early, 4:30am, as he didn't set the alarm clock correctly! Anyway we drove to the airport to drop Daddy off. However, Daddy managed to check in quickly, using the machine which meant he had almost 1.5 hours to kill. Farmor suggested to go back in the car and go for a drive along the coast!!! Well how this turned into a cauldron of stress I don't know. Well I do actually. The directions that came from the native, weren't that great. In fact at one point we went around in circles and didn't know which direction we were going in. We were lost! We did finally give up and follow signs for the motorway again.</p><p>The plane trip was good and Daddy could see the ground on this clear day. However, Daddy landed at Gatwick late and we were all there to greet him. Well Katie and Ben's greeting was 'Where's our sweets?' Cheeky monkeys. Daddy arrived at work at 9:30, even having gone on the M25. Not too bad.</p><p>Katie has been asking about Oldemor.</p><ul><li><i>Katie</i>Where is Oldemor?
        </li><li><i>Daddy/Mummy</i>She is up in the sky
        </li><li><i>Katie</i>How did she get there?
        </li><li><i>Daddy/Mummy</i>The angles came and took her
        </li><li><i>Katie</i>When can I see her again
        </li></ul><p>At which point it was getting a bit morbid, so we changed the conversation. She has asked a couple of times now about Oldemor which is touching, seeing she only seen her twice.</p>

    <title>Plane Spotting and The Lolly Incident</title>
    <info>
		<p>After lunch we went over to Bedfont to watch with all the other sado's aeroplanes coming into land. Ben was going ballistic for them. Shaking his arms, waving at the planes. Katie was telling us when the London (British Airways) planes were coming in.</p><p>We moved onto the playground at Staines where we've been a few times before. The water fountains are either going or being renovated currently which was a shame. After a go on the playground we went to get lollies and feed the ducks on the Thames. Katie with bread in one hand and a rocket lolly in the other, tossed her hand intending to give the ducks some bread. She got a bit confused and threw out the wrong arm. It went all quiet as Katie couldn't quite believe she threw her rocket into the river! As it floated away the water works were turned on full power. It didn't help that Mummy and Daddy were laughing. Anyway a replacement was bought and tears wiped away.</p>

		<p>After church we all went to Fleur's birthday party at the Mytchett centre. Katie was ever so good in the games. All the traditional ones. Anyway she kept getting to the last 3 or 4 and losing out. You could see she was disappointed but she took it ever so well. Daddy was a little bit worried that both Katie and Ben didn't seem to actually interact with the other children much. They always wanted to play with Mummy and Daddy.</p><p>We have finally managed to tempt Katie back on to her 'big girls bike'. She has been reluctant to put her helmet on previously.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_04_29-03-FleursBday.jpg</src><caption>Katie opening present in 'Parcel Parcel'</caption></image>

    <title>Sharon and Shwan's Wedding</title>
    <info>
		<p>We started the day by going into Gravesend for a spot of shopping and to walk along the river. It was rather dull and grey but the kiddies enjoyed seeing the boats.</p><p>We moved on to Cascades to play on the swings and go swimming. It was funny to see a 4.5 month pregnant lady squeezing into her swimming costume! Katie showed off her swimming skills, or as Daddy likes to call it, her underwater scramble for anything to keep her buoyant! Daddy took Ben on the long flume. Ben lasted about 5 seconds, before going through the darkened tunnel before he began to start crying. The flume sped up quite a bit and thankfully we got to the bottom with Ben seemingly not enjoying it. However, for the rest of the day, Ben mimed the slide action enthusiastically, accompanied with a wee sound signifying he did sort of enjoy it. Not sure.</p><p>After lunch with Charlotte we headed down to Sharon and Shwan's wedding in her local church in Sholden, Deal. It was a packed affair with the Fars, Susan and Graham in attendance. We only lasted 5 minutes in the church before we could cringe no more and get the children out. Sharon looked lovely walking down the aisle. Linda had a mixture of worryness and happiness emotions.</p><p>The service lasted over an hour and we managed to poke into a couple of family shots.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_05_05-02-SharonShwanWedding.jpg</src><caption>Sharon and Shwan</caption></image><p>We moved back into Deal and went to the British Legion hall for a fantastic morning breakfast. Graham was hearing the slide story 10 or 20 times from Ben. We also made a trip down to the beach and skimmed a few stones across the water. We stayed for a couple of dances from the live band. The kids were loving it.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_05_05-27-SharonShwanWedding.jpg</src><caption>Ben at the Beach</caption></image><p>A really nice day and it was good to see the Dixon family.</p>

    <info>
		<p>We went to Tweeseldown to watch some show jumping. Both Ben and Katie were fascinated by the horses jumping. There was also a  mobile farm there and to mummy's amazement Katie went in the goat pen and stroked a goat all by herself. Mummy had forgotten Ben's shoes so he couldn't go in and Katie did it all by herself even if it was for half a second before she got scared and ran out again. Then we found an inflatable army assault course which Katie begged to have a go on, Mummy thought she might be too small but she was brilliant. There was things to climb over and through, she had another go and then wanted another one but it was getting too late. As we were going home Katie spotted a 'bucking bronco' which she again was desperate to have a go on. We queued up but unfortunately she was too little. It was a great afternoon.</p>

When it was bedtime Lily stole the only cot at Ma Ma's and Ben would not go to sleep in the bed, he just kept sitting up and then Katie could not sleep and nor could Joey. It was nearly nine o'clock  before all four children were asleep and Mummy, Auntie Ellie and Pop Pop could eat dinner.</p><p>Meanwhile Daddy went up to Leeds for Steven's Stag weekend.</p><p>Friday was spent in a pool bar, the Elbow Room, Nando's and then Yates's and Oceaniana</p><p>Saturday, saw Leeds city centre, before moving towards Guiseley for It's A Knockout. The evening was a Pirates or Priests theme. I dressed as a dodgy Pirate! The costumes of the others were fantastic. After the Indian sit down meal we went into Revolutions then ended up in the Nu Bar.</p><p>Sunday was home day.</p><p>The highlights were...</p><ul><li>Nando's. Phil Rowe smashing the glass, trying to cuddle the waitress who pleaded not to say 'sorry' one more time, and Bazza's abominable language in reaction which quietened the whole restaurant!</li><li>Andy Tudor spotting a “mechanical ship” or as some might call it…..a car</li><li>Ballbag for actually looking like a vicar</li><li>Barrie West, for being the only man ever to wear a black shirt and trousers and STAND OUT and bringing £260 in cash for the weekend.</li><li>Kingster, for his well timed GET YOUR BANGER OUT comment.</li><li>Simon Fisher, for looking far too comfortable with his sword</li><li>Bunky, the campest pirate ever and his 'the bride downstairs is a bit of all right' comment.</li><li>Elder, for nearly killing the stag on the journey up with his entertainment system.</li><li>Tiller, for attempting to convince one of the hens that he was single, and that being 'engaged' still meant that he was technically single.</li><li>Ian Honnor (geez) for his full length dive in the penalty shootout and the subsequent claret!!</li><li>Barry Jenks, and his face of pure aggression in the bungee run</li><li>Dog, I’ve never seen a man eat a whole Subway baguette and miss his mouth with nearly all of it. And leaving his fancy dress outfit at the hotel DOH!!</li><li>Everyone’s pirate impressions that became increasingly like impressions of a farmer.</li></ul><p>Some cracking moments, can’t remember half of them at the moment.

    <info>
		<p>In the morning Pop Pop's friend fitted a CD player into Mummy's car, so we played and went for a ride on Katie's bike around the block.</p><p>Joey, Lily, Auntie Ellie and Ma Ma went to see Ma Ma's horse Tikki, which Joey stroked.</p><p>In the afternoon Ma Ma had bought tickets for Katie and Joey to see Noddy at Canterbury theatre. We all went over there had lunch in a cafe and then Auntie Ellie, Mummy, Pop Pop, Ben and Lily walked round the shops and along the river to see the baby ducks, while the others saw Noddy. Katie loved Noddy, Joey was scared but luckily Ma Ma had bought a huge box of sweets which made him better! We all came back and Katie snuggled up with Mummy and Pop Pop and watched her favourite programme You've Been Framed.</p><p>Another hard evening of getting all the children to bed, Katie went to sleep, then Mummy tried to get Ben to sleep, but he wouldn't go, but woke Katie who had had a nice power nap and was roaring to go again, by which time Ben had finally nodded off! Katie then sat up with Mummy and we watched some television and ate the curry Pop Pop had bought for us. Katie loved it, finally going to sleep at 9:30!</p>

		<p>In the morning we went to church. After we drove towards Ashdown Forest to see where Winnie The Pooh lives for a picnic. It was taking a long time to get there, so we stopped at a lovely park in Edenbridge instead and had a nice picnic. We fed the ducks, played on the swings, Katie had a ride on her bike and Ben pushed his little pushchair and then we had an ice cream. It was a really nice afternoon.</p><p>We drove home and Katie and Ben slept all the way. Daddy was home when we got in and we were all shattered. Mummy and Katie went to pick up the rest of the Christian Aid envelopes we delivered during the week while Daddy bathed Boo.</p>

    <title>London</title>
    <info>
		<p>First time the four of us have gone out for a while, and we decided to do the trusted London circuit.</p><p>First site of the underground train at Turnham Green got Ben in a frenzy. Arms flapping and the squawking! We 'Oystered' are way on and headed to Covent Garden. Mummy went through the exit barriers and Katie ran behind and got a smack in the face from the closing barriers. Ouch!</p><p>We ventured around the market and shops and sat down to watch one of the street performers. He was a sort of clown which rode a 10 foot unicycle. He had a big crowd and quite a sales pitch. He gave a child 5 pound for helping him and said 'arr he deserves it because he's performing in front of you' and 'you don't think 5 pounds is too much'.... as to say he was worth at least a fiver. Honestly he must have absolutely raked it in. The children I think enjoyed it all though it did take ages to get to the unicycle bit.</p><p>We walked around convent garden to see a carousel which Katie was dying to get on. However, she insisted on going on the carriage and not a up and down horsey much to mummy and daddy's disappointment.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_05_26-07-London.jpg</src><caption>Spin Me Right Around</caption></image><p>
        We headed south across Waterloo bridge and noticed loads of statues of men dotted all around. On the bridge and on the tops of loads of buildings. Must look up what that is all about. Kept us all amused for a while trying to spot them all. We must have seen a dozen or so. Just looked up, they're
        <a href="http://www.londonist.com/archives/2007/05/i_see_naked_peo.php">
          Anthony Gormley sculptures
        </a>
        . We ate lunch close by and walked along the South Bank and saw even more street artists.
      </p><ul><li>A man who had his dog through a table, pretending to be a dog in a kennel.</li><li>Football keepy up man</li><li>Lots of still man statues</li><li>A man getting out of chains, padlocked around his body.</li></ul><p>The performers all had the same pitch as the clown earlier. There must be a book on how to capitalize from street performing.</p><p>We went on the swings for quite a while, went past the London Eye and the Star Wars exhibition, went across Westminster bridge and caught a bus, where Katie's apple rolled the length of the bus along the floor. From Victoria we caught the tube, where Ben was doing very well impressing you young females, before returning back to base.</p>

After lunch, Karen and Rich came over to see Derby get promoted to the Premiership. Pop Pop and his friend then came around to look at the car and finally we got it working.</p>

    <title>Tyre, Deer, Swim, Smash</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went over to Aldershot to pick daddy's motorbike up, which had two new tyres, then to get Mummy's car tyre replaced. In a chance coincidence we saw Gary who was also at the garage getting some work done on the Belingo!</p><p>After a play on the mattress in the back garden, which has doubled up for a trampoline, we headed over to Wokingham. We first stopped off at a playground where Mummy and Katie played on the wickedest swing rope and saw a couple of deer playing in the field. Katie couldn't stop talking about the deer and what they had done.</p><p>We then went to Carnival swimming pool. Ben gained a bit more confidence and was able to splash about on his own and sort of make his way around the pool. Katie showed off how she can swim. I don't think she showed her full skills, preferring to still wear armbands.</p><p>When we exited the swimming pool, we saw a Tesco lorry crunch into a new BMW 335i. What a mess. The lorry drove off, but Daddy managed to run after it and get his number plate. We went to tell the man whose car it was and left our details. He later rang up to say thank you and ask for more details. The polish driver denied all knowledge!</p><p>We came home to wash the car inside and out which ended a busy day.</p>

    <info>
		<p>On this hot morning the girls walked to church, whilst the boys continued on their epic bike ride up the Grand Union Canal! Starting off from Grove Park Golf club they continued northwards. On the way, would you believe the chances, but they bumped into cousin David who was out training for a half marathon! After a nice chat we carried on past David's house through Hemel Hempstead and onto Berkhampstead. It was a lovely Oldie Worlde type town. We stopped off for a drink and a treat. Don't tell mummy! Anyway mad for trains Ben decided we should return on the choo choo.</p><p>We all got home in time for Roast Pork before shifting on to Auntie Susan's new home, which is just around the corner from their old house!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_06_03-01-BenKatie.jpg</src><caption>Ben And Katie</caption></image><p>Katie and Ben made themselves at home in no time by getting into Susan and Grahams bed! They rugby tackled the cushion to smithereens. In obvious need to release some energy we took them to the park for them to play Pooh sticks and on the swings.</p><p>Auntie Susan's new house was very nice. A good move we feel.</p><p>Early to bed after an exhausting weekend.</p>

		<p>The girls went to church whilst the boys went with the Fars for a bike ride around Windsor Great Park. Ben loved it as we saw plenty of horses and had a nice lolly. We made it to the George I status which has great views of the area, including the castle. Ben managed utter the words 'Farfar' and 'Farmor'.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_06_10-05-WindsorGreatPark-BenJette.jpg</src><caption>Farmor and Ben at George I statue</caption></image><p>They made it back just in time for the Parish lunch which was held at church. Luckily it was a nice day. Katie was besotted with James, and Ben kept saying 'Girl'. We'll obviously have to keep an eye on them both.</p><p>Afterwards we went straight around to the Fars to play in the back garden.</p>

    <title>Strawberry Picking</title>
    <info>
		<p>After a few errands in the morning we went over to Bordon way to meet up with the Elders to 'pick your own strawberries'.  The kids enjoyed themselves. There were a few sneaky tasting sessions. They were gorgeous. After collecting 2 big pun nets full, and digging and couple of potatoes and carrots we went back to the Elders where we went over the fields at the back of their house. During the week Ben and Katie have been going on about these cows that were plopping away. They were highly amused and felt they had to go and show Daddy them! It was a nice walk, although we didn't see much in the plopping department. The weather was drawing in and the kiddies were getting a bit tired, so we decided to head for home and lunch!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_06_16-08-StrawberryHaul.jpg</src><caption>Strawberry Haul</caption></image><p>The afternoon was spent doing a spot of shopping in preparation for Boodle (number 3 baby). We bought a bunk bed and looked at car seats. It looks as if we are not going to be able to fit three seats in the back! Mmmm. A new car?</p>

    <title>Bocketts Farm with Playschool</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today was Katie's pre-school outing to Bocketts Farm. Mummy, Katie and Ben went as Daddy had to work. It was raining on and off, but we had a great day. There was a lovely play barn there which Katie and Ben loved. Katie, much to Mummy's amazement just grabbed a mat and went down the highest slide ever and then Ben wanted to go on it too so Mummy had to go with him, not sure what the baby must have thought of it! We had a picnic in the rain, went on a lovely long tractor ride (Ben loved this) saw some pig racing, Katie picked the winner and went on the trampolines. Ben was terrified of the cows and sheep as they were really noisy and he sobbed real tears, so we had to go outside. Katie and Ben both stroked a baby goat and chicken. We finally went for a lollypop and while Katie and Ben played on the swings and sandpit with all her friends, Mummy had a cup of tea with the other Mums. We were there for six hours in the end, a great day. In the evening Mummy talked to Daddy about swapping infant schools. Katie had had such a lovely time with all her pre-school friends that Mummy feels sad about sending her to Heather ridge where she won't know anyone. So we have decided to change schools to Cross Farm so Katie can be with all her friends. There are thirteen pre-school friends going there.</p>

    <title>Jon and Rachel's Wedding</title>
    <info>
		<p>The morning was spent looking on the internet for a suitable car that would house the 5 Gay's. We swung between the Citroën Xsara Picasso, Vauxhall Zafira and Renault Scenic. We have at least made a start in deciding. We broke off to feed the fish in the pond, and as Katie says 'They were mad for it'!</p><p>The afternoon was spent at Jon and Rachel’s wedding down in Eastergate near Bognor Regis. The weather as seems the norm these weekends was inclement and it even started to thunder during the service. It was a lovely, cosy church, seemingly stuck in the middle of nowhere. We somehow kept the children entertained enough with books, food and milk during the ceremony not too cause too much fuss. "The Dingles" have arrived, which rang true to a certain extent with our crew.</p><p>We saw a few familiar faces including the Elders, Weston’s and Sanders. The weather staved off enough for photographs. Katie and Ben made the confetti shots. The familiar faces left for the morning breakfast whilst we had to kill 4.5 hours before the evening do.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_06_23-11-RachJonWedding.jpg</src><caption>Rach, Jon and the confetti kids</caption></image><p>We headed with Charlotte to Bognor Regis. Parked the car, then realized we forgot the pushchair. We made the half an hour round trip back to the church to collect it. Silly Mummy and Daddy!! Bognor Regis had a bit of a dying, holiday town about it. Not sure if it was the weather or the shops that had closed down, but there was no buzz to the place. We had a go in the penny arcades, and on a couple of the fairground rides on the seafront. We also threw stones into the sea which was quite choppy. A word of warning. Ben and Katie don't have much control when throwing stones so some might end up on your head or in your back if you are not careful!</p><p>We were with Charlotte and Mummy, so 5pm meant dinner time. We had a treat at the Fish and Chip restaurant. Katie ate and ate!!</p><p>
        We headed back to the car and drove 5 miles to Arundel, which is a lovely town dominated by the
        <a href="www.arundelcastle.org">
          Castle
        </a>
        . We went on the adjacent playground for quite a while and had a walk around the castle perimeter. Unfortunately we didn't have a enough time to look inside, much to Katie's disappointment. She wanted to see where the Princess lived!
      </p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_06_23-47-RachJonWedding.jpg</src><caption>Walking alongside Arundel castle</caption></image><p>We headed north 10 miles towards Petworth, going the scenic route, well let’s say Mummy was reading the map, to the evening do of the wedding. It was again in the middle of nowhere, in a converted barn with fields all around. The children liked the secret house. Ben found (another!!) female friend who supplied him with food from the buffet. It was a lovely relaxing evening. We eventually left way past bedtime at 9:15pm!</p>

    <title>Swimming and Great Cockcrow Railway</title>
    <info>
		<p>Another day of rain put pay to our intended trip to Finkley Down Farm with the Gays. Instead we went to Woking swimming pool for a bit of a splash around and some food in the cafe afterwards.</p><p>
        The weather improved a bit so we all decided to venture outside to the<a href="http://www.cockcrow.co.uk/">Great Cockcrow Railway</a>in Chertsey. The Fars went to pick up two distant relatives, Donald and Doris Southgate. When we say distant this is how it goes... Katie and Ben's Great, Great, Great Grandfather was George Gay of 1834. This man is Donald's and Farfar's Great Grandfather! See the
        <a href="/familytree/gayfamily.pdf">
          tree
        </a>
        . Still it is nice to keep in contact with such distant relatives. There was one common trait between Ben, Farfar and Donald and that is the love of steam trains!
      </p><p>The train ride itself was good. Two 20 minute rides left the bottom a little sore. Katie and Ben were getting a bit tired by the late afternoon, so left the older generations to look around the signal boxes with Farfar's childhood friend Jamie. A lucky escape by us!</p>

    <title>Mummy's 31st Birthday</title>
    <first name="katie">Dry night - No nappy!</first>
    <info>
		<p>We awoke at 6:50 to a phone call from Ma Ma saying that Auntie Charlotte had crashed and rolled her car. Fortunately she was fine and didn't need any hospital treatment, but she did bump her head! The car is a write off. It would appear there was diesel on the road. A car just after her also crashed!</p><p>
        We opened cards and presents. Daddy gave mummy a nice black and white canvas print of our

          London outing
        </a>
        back in January.
      </p><p>The Fars popped over with a present and a cake early in the morning, followed by Laura, Caroline and Henry, and later Fiona and Thomas for lunch. We then popped over to see Grandma and Granddad.</p><p>In the evening Mummy and Daddy went to watch Pirate Of The Caribbean III. Daddy likes Keira Knightly and Mummy, Jonny Depp.</p><p>We have been trying for the past 2 or 3 weeks to get Katie not to wear a nappy at night... And every night she has wet the bed! Except for tonight! Yoo Hoo. She got up to go on her potty all by herself.</p>

		<p>Katie's first trip to the dentist today. Mummy had her teeth checked first and then Katie, as good as gold jumped onto the chair and opened her mouth for the dentist. He said her teeth were lovely and white and then she was given a princess sticker which made her day. Mummy couldn't believe how brave she was, Mummy made more fuss! Auntie Ellie looked after Benny.</p>

    <title>RLC Open Day, Strawberry Fair, Sleep over on Babar</title>
    <info>
		<ul><li><i>Katie's Day With Ma Ma and Pop Pop - As told by Ma Ma</i>Katie and Ma Ma had such a lovely day together. First, when Katie woke up (6.15 am) we went downstairs and had a chocolate biscuit for breakfast (no cornflakes - sorry!). We then got Pop Pop up and he went off to Croydon to get Charlotte a new car. When he had gone we played Musical Statues and Musical Bumps until it was time to go shopping. Off to Sainsbury's we went and bought loads of goodies (as well as essentials). After lunch we went to the Strawberry Fair where Katie helped run the Fishing For Ducks stall. She also had her face painted and met Shrek (not particularly enthralled). Once home, we all played some more games until Mummy and Daddy and Bennybumbum arrived. Altogether a brilliant day!
        </li></ul><p>For the rest of us, Charlotte stayed the night and came with us in the morning to do a spot of shopping in Farnborough. Ellie who's 29th birthday it was, came along with Joey and Lily for a spot of lunch and then over to the RLC open day. We watched the amazing cavalry and had a go on the fairground whilst trying to dodge the showers.</p><p>Mummy and Ben raced over to Kent to spend the night on the Babar.</p>

		<p>Gillingham Marina was awoken at 6:30 with Ben signing at the top of his voice from the top of the boat - much to the delight of Pop Pop!</p><p>Daddy bombed over on his motorbike and took Ben over to Bluey, whilst the rest of the family went to St Nicholas. We packed a picnic and made our way uptown and toured around the Imperial War Museum. Katie and Ben were far too young to appreciate any of it, not that we expected anything more. Katie's most noteworthy point was looking around a 1940's home.</p><p>We trawled through the traffic home. Uncle Steven popped over for a bit which was nice.</p>

    <title>Motorbike Ireland Tour - To Rosslare</title>
    <info>
		<ul><li><i>Daddy's Bike Touring</i>Laura’s Uncle Howard and I had planned a motor biking trip around Steven and Joyce’s wedding. The first time either of us had done an extended bike tour and both first time visitors to Ireland (other than a weekend trip to Dublin).
        </li><li><i>Daddy's Bike Touring</i>I left work on a half day and realised we had to scoot in order to make Fishgaurd for the 6:30pm sail. Howard came around and we set off in changeable weather conditions. Conditions ranged from rain, to being sunny, but worst of all it was pretty windy. At times we had to slow right down as the wind was trying to blow us into the next motorway lane! We stopped off at Penarth services thinking we were almost there. I mean it’s a long way down the M4 isn’t it? However, we still had about 100 miles to go and we were struggling for time as the M4 petered out and the roads narrowed. This was a proper biking trip, weaving in and out of traffic at speeds higher than I would say was comfortable. We just made the boat in time, being last on. As one of the crew was strapping the bike down he noticed a pool of blue liquid under my bike! Oh no. We couldn't work out where it came from, but we did notice the chain was reasonably slack!
        </li></ul><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_07_04-01-ToRosslaire.jpg</src><caption>Daddy and Howard off motor biking</caption></image><ul><li>The crewman also asked whether we had strong stomachs as this was going to be a choppy ride. Well the first 15 minutes were fine. The next quatre of an hour the mood changed as the Sea Cat bounced up and down over the waves. The waves were splashing up on the sides of the windows. Passengers’ faces started to turn green, merchandise from the shop was falling off shelves and you could do comedy walks as we were treated to going up and down, up and down. The half an hour marker saw the first sick bags being used. I remarkably lasted till 45 minutes before the strawberry smoothie I had in port re-appeared! I felt better for it, but felt ever so sleepy and still a bit queasy. ‘Iron Gut’ Howard wasn't feeling the best.</li><li>Thank goodness the journey was just two hours and we arrived in Rosslare to a lovely sunset. We dumped our bags, managed to prize ourselves away from the helpful hotelier and went to the pub for a lovely fish and chips washed down with a pint. We then went for a bit of a walk and went into a more of a locals place down the road. An end to a nice day..... oh and I was sick again during the night!</li></ul>

    <title>Motorbike Ireland Tour - Rosslare, Cork, Skibbereen</title>
    <info>
		<ul><li><i>Daddy's Bike Touring</i>After our Irish Breakfast we said our goodbyes to the helpful hotelier and biked off in the rain heading west in the Cork direction. A chance to enjoy the Irish countryside. Well not really the weather was so bad we couldn't see much and had to concentrate a lot on the road. We hit New Ross, got lost in Waterford and then went on to Cork. All the towns looked quite similar in that there weren't any modern buildings, most of them painted colourfully, shot fronts were artistically decorated and the road surface shot to buggery! No need for speed humps.
        </li><li>By the time we got to Cork it had stopped raining and we walked down some of the pedestrianized streets and stopped off in a coffee shop for a nice round of sarnies and a hot drink. It was refreshing to walk where not every other shop was not part of a chain. Howard bought some 'tack' from the tourist information and we headed into the suggested deep, south west corner of Ireland.</li><li>Next stop was Clonakilty which was walked around for a bit. It had the same character and appearance as all the towns we had passed so far. Narrow streets, colourful, old-ish buildings. We weren't impressed with Clonakilty Bay, it looked like a swamp! We didn't know where we were going. Just heading in a general westward direction along the coast. We hit our first 'Wow' scene at Inchydoney Beach. A massive white, sandy beach with hills and cliffs either side. We stopped for some photos and continued along the dramatic coastline. It was nice to get out of the towns and off the main roads. I was really enjoying myself seeing the sites and riding with Howard.</li><li>Late afternoon we decided to base ourselves at Skibbereen. We tried a number of B and B's along the high street before the one that won 'Most Unusual B and B in Ireland' had a free room. That was because no one else actually would stay there! It was a place Laura would have run a mile from. It was set in a Victorian style, the deep red walls were filled with many artefacts like nude paintings, a stuffed bird and a certificate where the proprietor, Mona, had bought a Scottish title. There were dusty mannequins dressed in evening wear in the hall way. Mona showed us our room and enquired if we wanted a double or two twins! The bathroom across the hall was very different. It had deep red carpets, a massive corner bath, a bidet, a chez lounge and all Mona's toiletries it seemed. I couldn't stop chuckling to myself at how weird it all was. It was an experience. As I say Laura would have run a mile from this place.</li><li>We decided to do a couple more short excursions to Baltimore and Castletownsend. The sea was certainly still very choppy. Waves crashing over the harbour walls. We were nice and warm in our bike gear. We kept commenting on how this would be packed with tourists in the summer season when the weather was warmer and better... but of course we were already in July.</li></ul><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_07_05-23-WestCork.jpg</src><caption>Ship Wreck</caption></image><ul><li>We headed back into Skibbereen and had some fare in a pub. Ear wigging some locals conversation I found it difficult to comprehend what they were saying, their accent was something out of the film Snatch! The talk of the town was the recent drugs found washed up at a local village. 100 million pounds worth! There were quite a few pubs, but not many had more than half a dozen people in them. We finally parked ourselves in a place which had a bit of atmosphere and later a band. Howard had his first ever pint of Guinness at the age of 50! He thought it was alright.</li></ul>

    <title>Motorbike Ireland Tour - Ring Of Kerry, Dingle</title>
    <info>
		<ul><li><i>Daddy's Bike Touring</i>Mona had served melon and blackcurrant coulees for starter and a slightly alternative Irish breakfast. It included cheese on toast topped with marmalade, an interesting combination which I liked and Howard didn't. We had to move quick as the builders were in and ready to go. One had parked his truck such that the cradle was hanging above Howard’s bike! We headed out of Skibbereen and instantly began to ride on empty, windy roads viewing mountains and the coast. I had my Feeder mp3's on, the weather was good, motorcycling conditions were good and the scenery breath taking. It's very hard to describe and even the photos don't do it any justice. You've just got to do it yourself. Needless to say we seemingly stopped every five minutes to marvel at the views. It seemed we'd stop and see something we liked, go on a bit, go around a corner then another hidden treasure is presented, stop again to marvel take some photos and go on again. This morning was probably the best bit of the trip for me.
        </li><li>The roads were rough though! We kept seeing road works signs, then a '100' sign.... which I think meant 100 pot holes per kilometre! Boom boom.</li></ul><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_07_06-42-Kerry.jpg</src><caption>Stunning coastline</caption></image><ul><li>We wound around the mountain roads and eventually ended in the picturesque town of Kenmare. The gateway to the much heralded Ring Of Kerry. To begin with I must admit I wasn't that impressed, especially from what I had seen in the morning. The roads were certainly a lot busier with tourists and construction traffic. As we started to reach the west half of the peninsula the scenery again got more dramatic, looking across at the mountains. Small sandy beaches would pop up around the next corner. I liked seeing the small, green hilled islands poking out of the Atlantic Ocean and the waves crashing into the rocks. We stopped a number of times, but quickly pushed on after lunch which we had in a friendly Irish coffee shop. We headed for Sue and Richard’s cottage which we were going to stay at overnight at Boolteens.</li><li>It was in a beautiful location. Views of Slieve Mish Mountains out the back window and Dingle Bay out the front. Again difficult to describe really, but somewhere you'd want to retire to. We dumped our stuff and had a cup of tea before we parted ways. Richard and Sue went off to Tralee whilst we had the Dingle peninsula to explore. First stop was Inch beach, then onto Dingle itself. A busy town, again with old, colourful buildings. It's naughty to say this, but we didn't stop because we have had seen the same over the past couple of days.</li><li>Out west past Dingle we probably saw the most stunning scenery. We were biking along the cliff edge. The sea looked so blue. We stopped a number of times. On one stop I went into the top box to get the map only to find my pineapple flavoured smoothie decided to leak covering the shoes I am supposed to wear at the wedding and Howard's sat nav, which proceeded to no longer work! I couldn't even throw stuff away or clean up. Arrgghh. Anyway we laughed.</li></ul><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_07_06-89-Kerry.jpg</src><caption>The holy one</caption></image><ul><li>Heading out of the Dingle peninsula my back wheel flicked a stone, which hit and oncoming car on the driver’s door which dented it nicely. The stone then bounces back and almost hits Howard on the rebound who is following me! Anyway I was proud to have reached 100mph on Dingle! Don't tell Laura.</li><li>We scrubbed up at the cottage and then biked to Tralee to meet with the other wedding guests in the hotel. It was nice to meet up with familiar faces. There must have been about 30 of Steve's friends and family. We didn't return until gone midnight.</li></ul>

    <title>Motorbike Ireland Tour - Steve and Joyce's Wedding</title>
    <info>
		<ul><li><i>Daddy's Bike Touring</i>The day of the wedding. Barrie, Ellie (wife for the night), Laura and the children all came over on the 6:05am flight from Stanstead. The alarm clock went off at 2:30am! I went to meet them at the airport but couldn't find them! We eventually met up at the hotel and proceeded to go with Ma Ma and Pop Pop out to Banna beach where I decided to change and run into the cold sea. It was great as the waves were reasonably big to jump into. It wasn't cold once I swum around a bit. Ben loved running in and out of the water until he fell over in it and got soaking wet!
        </li></ul><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_07_07-24-JoyceSteveWedding.jpg</src><caption>Fancy a swim at Banna Beach?</caption></image><ul><li>We returned back to the hotel to freshen up and get changed. There were two busses to take the guests to the church which was in a place called Camp. The church was at the foot of the Slieve Mish Mountains, looking back across the bay of Tralee. The service was not so much as a couple of sides of paper, but more like a book! True to form the kiddies made life a little awkward. Katie needed a wee, so I took her outside into the bushes. She then proceeded to wee on her 'pretty shoes' and my hand, this all happening as Joyce was pulling up in the car. I was wiping my hands and Katie's foot out in the hallway where Joyce was waiting to make an entrance. Sorry Joyce..... Oh and she looked beautiful in her dress. I quickly nipped in and positioned ourselves back to normal. Then, as Joyce walked down the aisle Ben was standing on the pew and you could see on his face he was straining himself. The bowling lot behind us were going 'Pooey' and 'What’s that smell?' in jest. Anyway it was time for me to take him out and change his nappy. I knew keeping Ben in church would be like locking up a caged animal, so we went for a walk up the hill and saw the stream, some sheep and horses who chased us off. Not that I was scared! We returned for the last five minutes. Laura said it was a really romantic service, one I am gutted to have missed.</li></ul><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_07_07-99-JoyceSteveWedding.jpg</src><caption>The happy couple</caption></image><ul><li>We returned to the hotel. Laura and I were busy chasing the kiddies all over the place as photos were taken. We had a lovely chocolate fountain to distract us and proceeded to fill our faces.</li><li>Photos were taken and kids were there to be followed and chased around the corridors of the lovely hotel. We sat on a big round table with Ellie, Charlotte and the Allen’s'. The food was plentiful and nice. Martin Bigg's best mans speech is probably the best I've heard.</li><li>The evening went on with the boys getting on with the Irish lot. Laura and I took it in turns to go and mind the sleeping children. Unfortunately the dancing started too late for them. Katie was still going at 9pm, fit and strong, having been up since 3am! She's got Ma Ma's energy that is for sure. Barrie got drunk quite early and fell asleep first on the toilet and then in the hallway. He ended up drinking water for the rest of the night. Charlotte ended up in the boys room (but nothing happened), Nick was a hit with the Irish ladies, Howard was matched up by Ma Ma with a Tralee'n and Paul Deer offended some of the Irish with an off the cuff remark meant in jest! The party went long into the night. We were sad not to have seen it having gone to bed relatively early, shattered.</li></ul>

    <title>Motorbike Ireland Tour - Homeward Bound, Carnival</title>
    <info>
		<p>(Laura’s account) Ben woke up at 04:45, so it was a really early start for us all. Pop Pop drove us to Kerry airport where we flew to Stanstead. Ben was in a horrid mood on the plane as he was very tired and wanted a seat of his own like Katie but had to sit on Mummy’s lap, he was kicking and screaming. Katie made friends with the lady next to us, and when she offered Mummy her magazine to read Katie gave her Disney Princess magazine to read, which the lady did. It was lovely.</p><p>We drove home and got in our outfits to ride on the carnival float. Katie wore a pink tinsel wig to be Stephanie from Lazy town and Mummy a blue Bandanna for Sporticus. The playschool float looked great but we didn't win. Farfar and Farmor walked along the side with Benny in the pushchair. He seemed to love it. We also spotted all the playschool ladies, Auntie Karen and Uncle Richard, Uncle Barrie, Auntie Laura and Freya and Auntie Susan. Katie loved it. Afterwards we walked onto the green and went on all the stalls. Katie and Ben won an inflatable hammer each, which they hit everyone with. Katie tried her first candy floss (she didn't like it-mad!) She went on a really high inflatable slide and both Katie and Ben went on a tea cup ride which they loved, Mummy had to ask the lady to spin then more slowly as at first she did it so fast Ben couldn't keep sitting up although he was smiling! Ben had a train tattoo pained on his face and Katie a flower one, (which Mummy was later not allowed to remove before bed). We all had an ice cream. Overall a great afternoon.</p><ul><li><i>Daddy's Bike Touring</i>(Back to Martin’s account) I on the other hand had a long journey home about 450 miles.... which I enjoyed. We headed north first to Limerick then east through the lovely Tipperary and then Waterford just arriving in time for the calmer crossing to Fishgaurd. On my travels I managed to get 111mph out of my old CB500, whilst Howard pushed the 130mph barrier! Not one speed camera or police car in sight.
        </li><li>Back on the main land and we still had 250 miles to go which proceeded at a good pace. 60 miles to go and disaster struck! Passing Swindon at about 90mph all of a sudden my bike revved right up, and bits of metal were flying past Howard’s helmet! The chain had snapped and created sparks where it was being dragged along the tarmac. Anyway we both luckily returned home eventually unscathed.</li><li>Overall a fantastic trip which I really enjoyed. I have grown closer to motor biking now. Top tip are ear plugs, they make all the difference. Thanks to Howard as well who was great company throughout and had to put up with me! And of course congratulations to Joyce and Steven.</li></ul><woops rating="7" woopstitle="Who wants to go on a biking holiday with me?"><li><i>Tom Tom Smootied</i>Whilst winding the roads of Dingle, Kerry, my Pineapple flavoured smoothie decides to leak in my top box covering the shoes I am supposed to wear at the wedding and Howard's 'sat nav', which proceeds to no longer work!

The chain had snapped and created sparks where it was being dragged along the tarmac. Anyway we both luckily returned home eventually unscathed.

He got some nice clothes, vouchers, a sloe (a kind of garden hoe - ask Farfar), a bottle of beer and a left hander's pen!</p><p>Later in the day Katie swum five meters which is brilliant. I think it's time to get rid of those armbands.</p>

    <title>Motorbikes and Grace's Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>After last week’s Ireland trip there were plenty of jobs that needed doing including yet more maintenance to Daddy's motorbike! This time Daddy snapped the bolts that holds the brakes on.... and of course failing with some dodgy DIY of attempting to drill out the sheered bolts and re-tapping by... well just putting new screws in! Oh well another £30 down the tubes!</p><p>Ma Ma and Pop Pop popped over for a cup of tea then Katie had the first of three parties this weekend. First up was Grace which Mummy took her to. Meanwhile Daddy and Ben cycled through the woods to play with the trains at Farmor’s.</p>

    <title>Two More Birthdays</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie, a popular little girl, went to Eve's birthday which was held at Fizzy Kids (softplay place). Meanwhile, Mummy and Ben went to church together.</p><p>Auntie Charlotte popped over to dump some of her stuff as she was moving out of her student digs for a bit. Barrie, Laura and Freya also made a fleeting visit to drop off a belated card and present. Laura is freakishly looking as if she is at bursting point. She genuinely looks as if she had a bowling ball shoved up her top! She is now 3 days past the 40 week mark.</p><p>Later in the afternoon the four of us went to Natasha's party held at Runabout (another softplay). We all enjoyed ourselves here.</p>

    <title>Uncle John Garratt Passes Away</title>
    <info>
		<image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2005_03_05-41-Steves30th.jpg</src><caption>Uncle John Garratt</caption></image><p>Uncle John Garratt passed away this morning having suffered from a heart attack in a Dublin hospital. He was still touring the country after the wedding the previous week.</p><p>Although on paper he was a distant relative, he was close to all the immediate Barnett family. He was such a lovely man who always took an interest in everything you did. He would pop over and talk to the children, take lots of photos, chatted about his china collection or about a recent walking trip. His house Warrendale, was fantastic. A real life museum. A man who never ever watched television, kept three Jaguars, collected royal china, indexed every photo from the past 40 or 50 years and loved his gardening and diy'ing. He was very close to his brother and nephews despite them being in Canada.</p><p>We have tried to not mention it to Katie or Ben, as Katie still worries about Oldemor passing away earlier in the year. We feel there is no point upsetting her.</p><p>A man who we will sorely miss.</p>

		<p>Barrie and Laura went through a marathon delivery of about 24 hours! Laura went into hospital yesterday lunchtime, and Harrison was born healthy at 9lbs 2oz after a c-section.</p><p>Daddy met up with his ex FormScape mates at the wet, Reading Beer and Jazz festival... although there wasn't much jazz.

    <title>Boys Haircuts, Windlesham Arboretum, Swimming</title>
    <info>
		<p>The boys went off to get their haircut, whilst the girls helped each other out doing chores.</p><p>
        We were feeling a little guilty as Uncle John always mentioned
        <a href="http://www.chobham.info/windlesham_arboretum.htm">
          Windlesham Arboretum
        </a>
        and we had never been. So after a go on the swings at the memorial field we walked through the mud to a hidden treasure that was the arboretum. We ran around, played hide and seek and walked up the hill so we could run down again. We got a bit lost and ended up next to the motorway, but eventually found our way out.
      </p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_07_21-01-WindleshamArboritum.jpg</src><caption>Windlesham Arboretum</caption></image><p>The afternoon was spent down the Arena, and Katie showed us how she could swim without armbands. We still would call it a scramble for life rather than anything controlled. Still spent more time without armbands than she did with. Ben also bicycled his way around the pool.</p><p>In the evening mummy went on leg two of Sarah's Hen night in a jazz club in Ascot. She didn't return until 1am. Because she forgot her keys and Daddy was fast asleep she was locked out for about 15 minutes, banging on the door to try and wake Daddy up!</p>

    <title>Emma's Birthday, Susan Visit</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Daddy took Ben to church on the back of the bike. We stopped for ages by the railway bridge in Frimley Green to watch the cars struggle through the flooded road and to warn mummy. The boys waited and waited, only to realize that we had the only car keys! So Daddy and Ben had to race home!</p><p>After church we went off to Emma's birthday party. There was a clown woman (not mummy!) who was really good. We had a great time there.</p><p>In the afternoon Daddy and Farfar went over to Sutton to look at a Picasso only to find that the salesman couldn't let Daddy take it on a test drive because 'He was the only salesman there'!! Wow what a great answer to a prospective customer. They walked away no happy having spent the best part of the afternoon getting there and back.</p><p>Meanwhile Aunty Susan popped over to see us girls and drop off a birthday present for a certain person!</p>

    <title>Katie's 4th Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie and Ben came into Mummy and Daddy's bedroom at about 6:30am to open her presents. She had so many lovely things ranging from fairy dresses to sunglasses and a sticker making machine. She was really getting into it.</p><p>Grandma and Grandad popped over to drop something’s off, including another present, and helped us take some stuff down to the hall where Katie's party was going to be held. With the inclement weather this summer, at the last minute we decided to swap from our outdoor hula and paddling pool party to an indoor affair.</p><p>It took about an hour to setup. Fortunately we had some help from Auntie Ellie and Natasha's mum. The 14 little guests arrived promptly and it all started pretty manically. The kids were running and screaming around and giving the bouncy castle a good seeing to. There was a lot of energy released.</p><p>After about 20 minutes the kids settled down a bit and started making crowns on the craft table, dressing up as princesses, fairies and pirates, and taking turns in trying to pin the tail on the donkey that Grandad had kindly made up... Well that's if the tail hadn't gone missing. We just used a felt tip pen instead which served just as well.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_07_24-17-KatieBirthday.jpg</src><caption>The manic bouncy castle</caption></image><p>We played pass the parcel (or 'parcel parcel' as Katie calls it) then had a sugar inducing party lunch.... There was at least some fruit and sandwiches as well on the table. Katie was presented with her princess birthday cake and we all sang happy birthday. Most parties have the food at the end and I can see why now. The kids wanted to play around rather than play more games. We managed to muster half of them for a game of 'musical statues' and 'farmers in the den'.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_07_24-22-KatieBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Lunchtime</caption></image><p>The two hours were up and I think everyone had a good time. Mummy done ever so well in organising all this for me. It's not easy, especially with the last minute changes and being seven months pregnant!</p><p>After the long clear up session we went home to open all the presents received at the party. Auntie Ellie , Joey, Lily and Howard were there to watch. Wow, what a lot of presents.</p><p>We said our goodbyes, gave Natasha's mum some flowers then Auntie Charlotte arrived shortly before the Fars who had brought some lovely fish and chips. Yum Yum. We are all going on a healthy diet after today's food intake!</p><p>An end to a lovely day. Katie off her own back said 'Thank you mummy for a lovely party' at bedtime which was really nice of her. What a sweetie.</p><ul><li><i>Party goers</i>Ella Rout, Joey Elder, Lilly Elder, Freya West, Summer Teale, Alice Teale, Emma Tyas, Natasha Kelly, Sophie Roberts, Ben Stockwell, Poppy Franklin, Oliver Bandoz, Henry Jacquet, George Jacquet, Joshua Thompson, Grace Baier

    <title>The West’s, Trilakes</title>
    <info>
		<p>A frustrating morning where we went to some car salesman’s house to eventually look at a Xsara Picasso SX. It was a bit weird as he was a proper car salesman, but as he went to his storage area 10 minutes away we played with his 14 month old and his Russian wife! It was all a bit weird. Anyway the car drove well, but the interior was seemed very basic. Mainly the trim! Just put me off. Daddy was  pretty proud as it is the first time he's gone to see a car without buying it!</p><p>In the afternoon we went out to the West’s house for a bit of a play with Freya, then onto Trilakes with them.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_07_28-06-TrilakesWithWests.jpg</src><caption>Barrie and Daddy with offspring</caption></image>

    <title>Hayling Island Camping: Arrival</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy, Katie, Ben and Ma Ma set off bright and early for our camping holiday in Hayling Island with the car jam packed full of sleeping bags and deck chairs etc. Mummy had bought some Revels or 'pebbles' as Katie calls them and we could all eat one when somebody saw a different mode of transport. Katie kept making them up saying she had seen things when nobody else could see them!</p><p>We got to the campsite which was very muddy due to the freak weather conditions this year and Auntie Ellie met us with her tent and put it up for us. We made it all cosy and then headed off to the beach. We met Ella and Auntie Lindy accidently there and they joined us. Ella was on her way to the fairground and we went to. Katie wanted to go on everything Ella did, and she surprised Mummy with her bravery. Then Ella wanted to go on the runaway train rollercoaster but Katie drew the line at this, until Ben indicated he wanted a go and then Katie must have thought 'I can't let my little brother beat me', so Ma Ma took Katie on and Auntie Ellie took Ben on. They loved it and wanted to go again and again. Next we had hotdogs for lunch and headed for a paddle in the sea and a go on the seaside swing park and sandpit. It was lovely and hot.</p><p>We had takeaway pizza for tea (Katie's choice) by our tent and then Mummy put an exhausted Ben to sleep while Ma Ma and Katie played football.</p>

    <title>Hayling Island Camping: Swimming - Uncle John Garrett's Funeral</title>
    <info>
		<p>We all headed over to a muddy shower block. Katie and Ben are chalk and cheese. Katie wouldn't get out of the shower, Ben wouldn't get in. Ben screamed the shower block down when Mummy made him get in. After a shower we had a go on the campsite swing park and then headed for a swim in the campsite's outdoor heated pool. The pool was so warm and the weather lovely. We had great fun in there.</p><p>In the afternoon we headed to Windlesham for Uncle John Garrett's funeral. Katie and Ben went to play at Natasha's house and Mummy picked them up afterward's. After fish and chips for tea by the tent we all went to bed. During the night Mummy had an allergic reaction to the pollen from the newly mowed campsite and couldn't breathe and ended up being checked out in A and E.</p>

    <title>Hayling Island Camping: Isle Of Wight Zoo</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had a shower and breakfast and Mummy felt a lot better. We drove to Portsmouth and caught a ferry to Ryde. From there we got a train to Sandown and then a bus to Sandown zoo. It was a blazing hot day and the zoo without wanting to be horrible was not very good. They had eight tigers which were all asleep as it was so hot and three lions again much to Katie's disappointment were also asleep. They had a few small monkeys and a bug house (which was the best bit).It did only cost £6.00 to get in and nothing for children though. Katie also fell off the picnic bench and bumped her head so we were quite glad when we left there.</p><p>We headed to Sandown beach which was gorgeous and had a little swim in the sea. We found a tea garden and had a lollypop and a great swing park. Before going home Katie and Ben had a go on the trampolines which they loved. We didn't get home until late, so we bought some food from Tesco and ate by our tent. Mummy slept at Auntie Ellie's so she didn't get wheezy and Ma Ma and Katie slept in the tent together.</p>

    <title>Hayling Island Camping: Met the Stevens</title>
    <info>
		<p>We drove to the beach and met Lynne and Rachel and had a go on the Hayling steam train. Auntie Ellie, Joey and Lily were with us. The train stopped at a swing park on the beach where we played and then got the train back.</p><p>After lunch it started to rain. Katie and Ben wanted to go back to the fair and go on the runaway train, which we did. Joey would not go on anything except a little train that went around and then Auntie Ellie had to go on to as he was 'shy' of it.</p><p>It then started to pour down so we did the scarecrow hunt, in aid of the Hayling carnival, 76 scarecrows were hidden around the island. We bought a map with a route and you had to spot them and write down their names. Katie, Ben and Mummy were in one car and Ma Ma, Auntie Ellie, Joey and Lily in the other. We had a race, meeting back at the campsite after an hour and a half seeing who could find the most. We lost by 9 scarecrows but had great fun. Katie spotted loads but Ben was no help as he slept the whole way.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_08_02-04-Camping-HaylingIsland.jpg</src><caption>Joyriding the Benny Bus</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_08_02-05-Camping-HaylingIsland.jpg</src><caption>Joyriding the Benny Bus 2</caption></image><p>It stopped raining so we had a BBQ and a campfire singing lots of songs, probably annoying the rest of the campsite. As it had rained Mummy was able to snuggle in the tent all night without any wheeze, the pollen must have been dampened.</p>

    <info>
		<p>We went back to the outdoor pool on the campsite. Katie stayed in for two hours she didn't want to get out. We bought a nice picnic and ate in a field. From there we drove to Portsmouth for a go on the funfair. We also had a sit on the beach and an ice-cream. You could watch the hovercraft come in and out which absolutely fascinated Ben, until it got him wet as it left and he cried, but he still went back to watch it again.</p><p>We drove home via Ellie's to drop off her tent as we couldn't move in the car. We arrived home exhausted but we had a lovely time.</p><p>Ben told daddy all about the hovercraft that went splash and made him wet. Daddy must have heard the story told about 50 times! It reminded him of when Barrie told the 'Jon Jonno' story on his stag weekend!</p>

		<p>Ben, with the help of Katie opened his presents on Mummy and Daddy's bed at 7am! It's funny because Ben isn't too fussed about actually opening the presents, he was quite happy Katie taking the lead role.</p><p>We had a bumper turnout for Ben's birthday which was held in our poor old back garden. There was blazing sunshine and Ben's friends came over to paddle, bounce, build sand castles and general cause mischief. Daddy done the BBQ, whilst Mummy organised a couple of games.</p><p>It was pretty chaotic. We wonder what Grandma, Grandad, Peter and our neighbours thought of the music, shouting, crying and Ma Ma's voice!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_08_05-10-BensBirthday.jpg</src><caption>PARTY!!</caption></image><p>The party lasted about 3 hours before some decided to join us at Frimley Lodge Park for a trip along the miniature railway which Ben goes potty for. Daddy insisted on waiting for a nice steam engine, rather than those horrible smelling diesels. After playing on the swings we then returned home for the start of 'operation clear up'. What a mess the house and garden was!</p><p>Both Uncle Howard and Steven popped over for a bit to give presents and stop for a chat which was nice. We couldn't tempt them on one of the 24 burgers we had left over!</p><p>Karen and Rich also popped over last knockings bearing gifts. Ben is so lucky to receive so many nice presents.</p><p>A really enjoyable day for the kiddies. Ben and Katie were both really tired outcome the end of the day.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Ma Ma took Benny for a walk to feed the ducks and to the swings in Istead Rise so Katie and Mummy could have a little girly trip to buy all Katie’s new school uniform, ready for her first day a few weeks. We bought a dress, polo shirts, plimsolls, socks, tights and P.E shorts. Unfortunately Clarks did not have Katie's shoe size and we could not find any nice winter coats so we will have to get those later. We had lunch at McDonalds. Katie had her first happy meal which she loved!</p>

    <title>Summer's 3rd Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Daddy constructed the bunk bed as both Katie and Ben are now going to sleep in the same room, so that our brother or sister can have the baby room. The bed came in about 100 pieces and both Katie and Ben done their best to help.... in only the way they know. i.e. all the bits went everywhere!</p><p>In the afternoon we went over for Summer's third birthday in Gravesend</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_08_11-09a-SummersBday.jpg</src><caption>Jumping for joy at Summer's Birthday</caption></image>

    <title>Greenwich - Bunk Beds</title>
    <first name="benjamin">In the bunk bed</first>
    <info>
		<p>We missed church and went up to Greenwich Park. We parked up the top as usual and walked our way down through the squirrel and deer park down to the big swing park. We spent ages there and even stopped for our picnic. We then made our way passed the burnt out Cutty Sark site, which incidentally was just a load of boarding, and proceeded for our race! Daddy and Ben in the lift were beaten by Mummy and Katie running down the stairs. A frightful thought!</p><p>We emerged on the north side of the river and went on the short trip on the DLR to Mudchute, so we could look around the farm. Ben again was going mad for the trains! We had a look around and said hi to Farfar who was wallowing around in the mud.</p><p>We returned back on the train and Daddy ran all the way through Greenwich and the park to get the car so that the tired troops didn't whine too much!</p><p>The bunk beds! Well it didn't go too well. Katie and Ben played around a bit too much and when they did finally go to sleep Ben fell out of bed (from the bottom bunk!), waking Katie up. Ben ended up sleeping in the cot. We'll move him back when we get a guard rail.</p>

    <title>Sarah and Andrews Wedding</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went over to Hartney Witney to look at a car which we put a deposit on.... although Daddy is not sure he's made the right decision. We shall see next week when we go and pick it up.</p><p>Then the moment Katie has been looking forward to for a long while... being a bridesmaid at Andrew and Sarah's wedding. She was excited at the prospect at walking down the aisle with Oliver and having the first dance with him. She was a princess. She looked so beautiful in her dress.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_08_18-06a-SarahAndrwWedding.jpg</src><caption>Bridesmaid Katie</caption></image><p>We arrived at St Andrews, Frimley Green just before the 2pm kick off. We sat near the front and Katie and Oliver followed Sarah down the aisle. Katie's face was a picture and she beamed a smile all the way down. The service was short and for the first time both children behaved themselves.</p><p>After the service and a few photos, which incidentally Michael took, we headed off to Wonersh for the reception. We amazingly made it, even though we didn't take a map and mummy thought it was in Compton about 7 miles away!</p><p>The Barnett Hill Hotel was set in lovely grounds which unfortunately we couldn't take advantage of because of the dire weather. We did however make use of the games room downstairs and played table football and pool.</p><p>The meal was lovely and the speeches refreshingly short and sweet. The whole day was kept simple and relaxed... well as much as you can with Katie and Ben! Throughout the day there were some nice Polish touches to the proceedings. A Polish reading in church and a seemingly polish tradition of tapping your glass during the morning breakfast which 'forces' the bride and groom to kiss each other. We also heard some polish songs as well. Really nice touches which makes the day a little different.</p><p>Disco time. Katie, Ben and about six other kids stole the dance floor for a bit. They were loving it. We managed to stag till 10pm before we had to admit defeat and take the terrapins home.</p>

    <title>Fars For Lunch</title>
    <info>
		<p>The weather was again unkind to us and again we had to postpone our trip to the farm with the Fars. Instead we went over after church for lunch and playtime with the train track, dolly trolley and farm. We later went for a walk down to Tomlins Pond to feed the ducks and swans. Susan and Graham came over as well and helped push us on the trolley.</p>

    <title>Stressy Reigate and Reading Speedway</title>
    <info>
		<p>We drove to Reigate park to meet Ma Ma, Auntie Ellie, Joey, Lily, Great Grandma and Great Grandad. It started off quite stressfully as Mummy couldn't remember where the park was and we drove round and round the one way system trying lots of different roads. In the end we found the car park where we were all supposed to meet only to find it was shut as lots of the park was under reconstruction. So we had to drive off again and find another place to park that was free as Mummy had no money in her purse! We were running really late by this time and then when Mummy got Benny out of the car his nappy had leaked and he needed completely changing. Next in the line of stresses was the fact that a heavily pregnant mummy really needed a toilet but as the park toilets were also shut we had to walk for ages to find another one.</p><p>By the time we reached the swings we were so late and Katie and Boots were hungry and fed up. Ma Ma and company were not there as they had apparently got stuck in traffic to, so we played on the swings. Mummy found it really hard to keep her eyes on Katie and Benny as it’s such a big park and they both wanted to go on different things. Anyway when everyone arrived we had a lovely picnic as Ma Ma had bought lots of nice treats. We walked to the ducks and fed them while Mummy had to trek another long mile for a toilet. She came back to find Katie and Joey splashing in muddy puddles. Mummy had stupidly dressed Katie in her new white trousers which were now brown trousers. We finished the day with an ice cream from the most expensive van in the world but it was nice!</p><p>Farfar's birthday present this year was a trip to Reading Speedway with Daddy and Farmor. It was a strange evening because there were a number of bad crashes with each of the riders having suspected back problems. On the second big crash we had to wait for the ambulance to return from the hospital! In the end the number of races was curtailed to 13.</p><p>The races themselves were OK, the highlight was smelling the burning oil. Mmmm. The bikes really do accelerate at a phenomenal rate. They have just one gear and no brakes! Got speaking to one of the regulars who explained all the rules and what was going on. Quite interesting how it is all setup. Riders almost race freelance and can move from team to team. They are also commission based. The more points they win, the more money they get. He said they rarely have the ambulance on the circuit. I think we bought bad luck as it came on at least twice.</p>

    <title>New Car - Chertsey Win - Painting</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Daddy went to pick our new car. Well 7 year old car! It's a 2000, Nissan Almera Tino, done 39K miles and cost us £2900 after trading in the Corolla. We didn't think we'd get anything for our mobile tip. The car is probably the smallest we could get that will fit three car seats. The Zafira had only a middle lap belt and the Picasso was too expensive for us in the end, especially if you compare it to what we have with the Almera. It has good safety and reliability records so hopefully it will hold us in good stead for the next few years.</p><p>The afternoon was split between boys and girls. The girls wanted to paint some shelves whilst the boys went to watch a convincing 3-0 win for Chertsey against Raynes Park. The weather was glorious.</p>

    <title>Paulton's Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>We left early for a fun day out at Paulton's Park. Saying that we still managed to get caught in traffic! The children got excited, almost too excited. Katie was not feeling too adventurous whilst Ben was, but he wasn't allowed to go on too much because he was too small! Poor Ben. There were plenty of rides that we all could go on, the favourite being the tractor ride. "Again, Again." We went on it three times. We went to see some of the animals, but it was the playground and the rides which were the big draw today.</p><p>After lunch Katie was beginning to feel as if she could go on some of the more exciting rides which pleased Daddy. Mummy unfortunately couldn't go on them! A full fun day out had by all.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_08_26-07-PaultonsPark.jpg</src><caption>The Vikings on a Viking boat</caption></image>

    <title>Frensham Ponds - Rachel's Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy rushed over to Gravesend quickly to try and sort Ma Ma and Pop Pop's new broadband without too much success. Not got the password!</p><p>We all met up at Frensham Ponds for Rachel's birthday. Ben and Katie loved playing in the water and going on the space hoppers. Along with Daddy we began to dig out a river and a tunnel before other kids came in and took over. Daddy was gutted as he was quite proud of his construction!</p><p>The water was pretty cold, the children being only ones brave enough to go in properly. It was busy with many kids running around enjoying themselves. At one point some concerned parents couldn't find 'Heather'. It makes your stomach turn they were shouting and scanning the water for the little girl. She was found just a couple of minutes later walking aimlessly 50 years away, oblivious to the commotion. A scary moment.</p><p>We had a picnic which because we didn't contribute much meant it was a really nice spread. None of your 'value' Laura food! We had a chocolate cake which melted quickly in the sun and then some ice creams.</p><p>We were all pretty filthy by the end of it. A big scrub in the bath was needed.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_08_27-13-FrenshamPonds.jpg</src><caption>Frensham Pond birthday visit</caption></image>

    <title>Aldershot Lido</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie, Ben and Mummy picked up Uncle Peter from his new house then met Auntie Lindy and Ella at the Aldershot lido. We walked to a nice swing park and had a play and at 12:30 we walked back to meet Auntie Ellie, Joey, Lily, Ma Ma and Auntie Charlotte. We paid to go into the Lido for the day even though the weather was coldish (as has been for most of the holidays). We had a picnic and then some braved the cold water. Katie and Ella amazed us by going completely in as did Auntie Ellie and Auntie Charlotte. Mummy would have loved to but the midwife had said earlier it might not be advisable, as the water was very cold. Joey and Ben stuck to the paddling pool, which Ben kept saying was cold. Ma Ma went in but didn't swim. After about twenty minutes we got out and went in the sandpit there. Luckily Auntie Lindy and Ma Ma had brought buckets because Mummy forgot. Ma Ma also brought giant dominoes and bowls which Katie and Ella loved. We had a lollypop and left about four it was a really good day.</p>

    <title>Lily Christening - 7th Wedding Anniversary</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy cycled with Ben over to the Fars house even though they were both out. We didn't want to see them, we wanted the train set!! The challenge was to use every bit of track, every station, boat terminal, bridges and tunnel. Well we managed it. Ben was very particular on which train could be moved by Daddy! As true workman we stopped half way through for a glass of "molk" and a "cracker".</p><p>In the afternoon we went to Alton for Lily's christening. The service was shared with two other children, all behaving themselves very well especially when the vicar doused them in water. We returned to the Elder's household for some nibbles and to catch up with friends and family.</p><p>Oh yes it was Mummy and Daddy's wedding anniversary, which sort of sailed past unnoticed, just a chocolate bar in the evening and watching a film!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_09_02-05a-LilyChristening.jpg</src><caption>Lily's christening</caption></image>

		<p>It was Niamh 5th birthday and it was held a softplay called Jakes in Bagshot. It was a lovely birthday as there weren't too many invited so Katie knew everyone and the place itself was only half full, or was it half empty? Anyway Daddy spent a lot of time in tubes, slides and other contortion-ary' apparatus.</p><p>In the afternoon Daddy went out with the boys to Reading to watch England V Israel. Whilst the rest of us played and went to the park.</p>

Katie proceeded to root out Karen's shoes from somewhere which of course she was particular fond of. Katie ended up with one of Karen's tops on as well in the end, because she covered her original t-shirt with chocolate sauce! Mummy and Daddy cringed when he children played in the white carpeted and white sofa'ed conservatory with mucky fingers and dirty feet!</p><p>We walked to the park on this hot and sunny day.</p>

		<p>Katie has been very excited about starting Cross Farm. We woke at 7-ish and got dressed into the blue uniform and all drove into Frimley Green and met up with Natasha and her mummy at their house. We made the 15 minute walk and arrived just before the 9:30 start.</p><p>We were greeted by the headmistress and led into the school hall where we were told the procedure for the next few days.</p><p>Then we settled Katie into Lambs class. She ran off to play in the wendy house and that was the last we saw of her really.</p><p>Picking her up at 1pm, we didn't get too much out of her. We think she just played for most of the day. A glorified playschool session. Happy to go back tomorrow.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_09_11-02-KatieSchool.jpg</src><caption>Katie's gonna be bright at school</caption></image>

		<p>Finally the five a side team is complete. Jessica was born at 4:55pm, happy, healthy and weighed in at 7lbs 13.5oz.</p><p>Jessica's middle name Ellen is Oldemor's (Great Grandmother's) Christian name and Uhrskov also a family name handed down through many generations of the Danish wing of the family tree. If Jessica turned out to be a boy we would have called him Thomas Scott Uhrskov Gay.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_09_11-08-JessicaBorn.jpg</src><caption>A happy Laura and screaming Jessica</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_09_11-19-JessicaBorn.jpg</src><caption>Sleeping ladies</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_09_11-22-JessicaBorn.jpg</src><caption>Battered and bruised Jessica</caption></image><p>Mummy first got regular contractions on the Monday and stayed up all night on the hope they would become frequent and regular.</p><p>We took Katie to school and Mummy needed to stop a couple of times in order to squeeze Daddy's hand. Auntie Charlotte came down and looked after Ben and Katie as Mummy's contractions were getting a little more painful.</p><p>We got to hospital at about 1pm and Mummy was doing ever so well in managing the pain taking pethadene and the gas and air. She was high as a kite at some points. A strict midwife was requested when there was a change in shifts. We got one!</p><p>Mummy got to 7cm dilated and gave birth all within 30 minutes. She screamed at the top of her voice at one point, and then apologised for it!</p><p>Daddy could see the head and 3 pushes later, little Jessica was born. We forget how purple and slimy they come out. Daddy was able to clip the cord. Mummy and Daddy were overjoyed.</p><p>Daddy said it was a boy, which shocked Mummy as she was convinced it was going to be a girl. It was a girl. Not sure if it was the drugs, but Mummy preached "I've got the gift, I said it would be a girl. I've got the gift". "Yes Laura, let's not worry about that, we've got a baby".</p><p>Jessica was placed on to Mummy's chest for a bit before some extra bits and pieces needed to be taken care of. Mummy was exhausted and was so tired that she dozed for a while, giving Daddy some one on one time. "That’s another wedding that's going to cost me".</p><p>Katie and Ben came in with the Fars for their first look at Jessica. Katie was interested and loving and wanted to cuddle Jessica. Ben on the other hand wasn't quite in tune with the situation and just wanted to look out of the window.</p><p>
        Mummy was hungry but was also suffering from nausea. After a bath we were shipped off to the maternity ward where Jessica and Mummy settled in for the night on a noisy ward. She has to stay for 48 hours to ensure Jessica has got the

    <info>
		<p>It was quite a challenge for Daddy to get the children ready, for Katie's 9am start. Again Daddy and Ben went into hospital to visit Mummy and Jessica, hoping they might be allowed home. However, we were going to have to wait till later.</p><p>Jessica still very healthy and with a nice colour now. She's feeding off the breast OK, and she is now producing at the other end.</p><p>Daddy and Ben picked Katie from school and we went to Frimley lodge park to play on the swings, feed the ducks, see the big trains and play on the small train tracks. We then rushed to ballet for Katie and then onto the hospital. They were very short staffed, but at 6pm we were allowed to return home as a family of five!</p><p>Mummy was fit and raring to sort lots of things up. It is business as usual for her, as if she hadn't gone through labour just 2 days previous!</p><p>Jessica slept in the mosses basket next to Mummy and Daddies bed all night. She is so cute!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_09_13-05-Jessica2day.jpg</src><caption>Sleep, sleep, sleep</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_09_14-18a-Jessica3day.jpg</src><caption>The three monsters</caption></image>

    <title>First Two Weeks</title>

		<p>Over the past two weeks we have had many visitors all coming to see a mainly sleeping baby! She awakes for feeding, and boy does she feed, she has put on 11oz. A fatty and no denying it.</p><p>Katie and Ben really show a lot of love towards Jessica. Both asking to give cuddles and kisses. Luckily there has been no resentment at all. Katie calls her Jessa or Jess and Ben calls her Car, because he can't seem to say the 'Jessi' bit.</p><p>Jessica is quite sicky and poo's very well. She's given us some smiles, Mummy convinced they're genuine smiles! At night time she is pretty unsettled. Daddy's favourite bit is the 8pm till 10pm shift where Jessica sleeps on Daddy's chest. Daddy's favourite.</p><p>Daddy back to work on Monday, so the real test comes for Mummy.</p>

    <title>Legoland</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        We went with Ma Ma, Pop Pop and the Elders to<a href="http://www.legoland.co.uk/">Legoland</a>. It was pretty expensive, but the park was massive! So many good things for the kiddies to try.
      </p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_09_22-07-Legoland.jpg</src><caption>Excited to be at Legoland</caption></image><p>We tried the tea cup ride, the excellent Rat Run, the carraseol, the swing roundabout before settling down for our picnic. We queued for the diggers for 45 minutes, having got to the front Michael and Joey were interrogated on Joey's age. We hadn't realized that the diggers were only allowed for 3 year olds and above.</p><b>Joey's first big lie!</b><ul><li><i>Joey</i>I'm 2!
        </li><li><i>Lady</i>Sorry you can't come on
        </li><li><i>Michael</i>No, he's 3 today. It's his birthday
        </li><li><i>Lady</i>Sorry I've got to hear it from the child. How old are you? (Real interrogation at this stage, where half the queue were looking over)
        </li><li><i>Joey</i>I don't know
        </li><li><i>Michael</i>It's your birthday today isn't it?
        </li><li><i>Joey</i>A confused nod of the head from Joey
        </li></ul><p>Anyway they managed to get on to the anti-climatic ride in the end. Meanwhile the rest were having a great time in the water fountains and spray area. Katie just loved it and ran around for ages. Ben was a little more reserved.</p><p>After a go on the helicopter ride and serine boat trip, which Jessica even went on, we headed towards the Lego models which were the kids favourites. Ben was of course interested in the model trains and watching them come out of the tunnels, which Katie admired the 'views' as she called them.</p><p>We finally ended the day with a go on the monorail ride and the train.</p><p>A really good day out. Shame we didn't manage to see half the park. Seriously contemplating an annual season ticket, but at £55, its quite a bit of money.</p>

        Jessica has been quite unsettled at times. She can go through spouts of several hours where she screams her lungs out and looks as if she is in real pain as she arches her back. We think she has a lot of trapped wind. She is suffering with

      </p><p>Today the health care visitor saw her swollen, purple stomach and referred her to the GP. The GP said get down to Casualty to get it checked out. A number of tests were carried out and the medical staff didn't seem over worried, but there again didn't explain what was wrong with her. Just we've got to monitor the situation.</p><p>Jessica has been feeding and pooing well. She sleeps during the day and has been keeping us up at night. She still looks ever so gorgeous.</p>

    <title>Another hospital trip and Dettingen Open Day</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        Well what a week for illnesses and sleep deprivation. On top of her
        <a href="http://hcd2.bupa.co.uk/fact_sheets/Mosby_factsheets/infant_colic.html" />
        colic, poor Jessica went off again to hospital as she had a high temperature, 38.6c, and was quite blocked up, catching Daddy's cold we think.
      </p><p>She spent Thursday and Friday night on the Children's Ward at Frimley Park more for observation than anything else. Mummy stayed in with her, leaving an unwell Daddy to look after Katie and Ben.</p><p>The Fars kindly took in Ben and Katie whilst Daddy was visiting Mummy and Jessica. On Friday evening they played trains with us, then gave us some nice dinner, baked beans chips and pizza followed by a bath. It was a nice change to have this all at the Fars.</p><p>Thankfully this morning we picked the ladies up from hospital and decided to postpone our planned trip to London, instead having a more at home day.</p><p>In the afternoon we headed across the road for the Dettingen Open Day. A small thing that we didn't even realise that was on until 10am. Anyway there were Police vehicles to climb on and in, army trucks and firing line, a bucking bronco, a popular bouncy castle, a five a side tournament and face painting which Katie and Ben were excited on having themselves done.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_09_29-19a-DettingenOpenDay.jpg</src><caption>Painted faces</caption></image><p>In the evening Daddy popped out to see Great Grandad perform two old songs in front of a church group. He was very sweet and put a lot of passion into his performance. Daddy got it on video. Something to show at Christmas I think!</p>

    <title>Over to Auntie Susan’s</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy braved taking the three of us to church this morning and showed off Jessica to her church friends.</p><p>In the afternoon we popped over to Auntie Susan's to drop off her 30th birthday card and present. Katie and Ben were running riot! As ever it ended in tears with Ben banging his head against the door. He worried us all as begun crying, his face turned blue as he didn't come up for breath. Thankfully he did in the end but he got us worried. We went over to the swings and fed the ducks which was nice.</p><p>We are getting a bit concerned over Ben's poor behaviour at the moment. He's just generally naughty and we don't seem to make him realize this fact. Katie on the other hand is so good natured, except when she is tired. It's hard for Ben as he gets far less attention now, with a lot of our energies going on comforting Jessica.</p>

    <title>London Day Out</title>
    <info>
		<p>We decided to go up to London this week. The children were desperate to 'do some transport'. So eventually we caught the train from Woking, after Daddy had forgotten the pushchair.</p><p>Ben, Katie and Daddy were looking out of the window and seeing who could see stuff first. Katie, I think is colour blind. I don't think she can distinguish green from red! We arrived at Waterloo and headed for the underground.</p><p>We headed for Oxford Circus and changed to go to Queensway so we could enter Hyde Park where the good playground with the big ship is. On the Central line, there were not enough seats. Katie sat on a thrilled Japanese lady's lap, whilst Mummy and Ben chatted to this old chap. Everyone was real friendly.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_10_07-06a-London.jpg</src><caption>Socialable Central Line</caption></image><p>At Hyde park we played on the ship and all the other playground toys. This is where all the rich toffs take their children to play. The amount of money that must be flowing around. The kids from Notting Hill and Kensington were here!</p><p>Mummy had a Burger King voucher, so for lunch we decided to hunt a store down. We caught the bus to Marble Arch and started walking down Oxford Street. We walked and walked and passed five McDonalds, but no BK's. Ben and Jessica fell asleep and you don't want to be around Mummy and Katie when food is on the offing and they are hungry! We walked the whole length, down to Charring Cross Road, still no sign. We walked down Shaftsbury Avenue and hopped in the Piccadilly Circus store. We had our health conscious burgers and chips before catching a 30 minute bus to the Monument.</p><p>Our mis-fortune continued as it was shut! Scaffolding all around it. Oh dear. We walked across London Bridge, caught a train back to Waterloo and walked to the swings and street entertainers by the London Eye.</p><p>Although the street entertainers are all that we have seen before the children loved seeing them. Mummy was getting worried about the time, as it was first in the series of Strictly Come Dancing. We headed back to the train station and zoomed home.</p><p>Jessica slept most of the way around London! Still she peered over once or twice when we were on the train.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_10_07-52a-London.jpg</src><caption>A real beaut!</caption></image>

    <title>Parties Galore</title>
    <info>
		<p>Another weekend and another couple of parties to attend. Obviously a popular party girl is our Katie. In the morning it was Sophie's fifth birthday held at Jakes. We all went, and it was a really nice party. The second half was spent as a group and we played games and had food.</p><p>The afternoon was split between the girls and boys. The girls went to the play gym for Joshua's forth birthday. Joshua used to be our next door neighbour. The boys on the other hand cycled down to Frimley Lodge park and joined up with Farmor to go on the miniature railway. Ben can now distinguish between steam and diesel trains. His obsession has no signs of abating, just standing there staring at the steam train that had come into the siding.</p><p>After having the first go, we went to the packed out swings and onto the canal before making our final trip around the loop, this time on a stinky diesel. As it was nearing the end of the day, they were retiring the trains back to the engine shed to much delight to Ben. He is a real anorak.</p><p>After our Sunday dinner, Daddy had to take the car to the garage to get an oil leak fixed.</p>

    <title>Katie stays over at Fars</title>
    <first name="katie">Staying over at the Fars</first>
    <info>
		<p>Katie and Ben spent their first ever night at the Fars on Friday. There was no special reason, it was done just for fun. They arrived in time to play an hour with the wooden train before tea of fish fingers, chips and baked beans. This was followed by a bath and bed time story, just like at home.</p><p>They had their story in Farfar and Farmor’s bed where they slept for the night. The Fars were sent off to other rooms for their sleep.  Katie woke twice in the night but Ben slept through. They woke at 7.44am and Farmor and Farfar woke at 7.45am having been brought to order by Katie calling out, "Farmor." We all got up and the railway tracks, which had also been put to bed for the night, had to be reassembled for another session of running trains. The two were dressed after breakfast of cornflakes and yoghurt and played happily until mum and dad arrived at around ten o'clock.</p><p>Ben and Katie were very well behaved all through their time at the Fars. There was not one tantrum or any crying; a very happy visit for everyone except mum and dad who missed them not being at their own home.</p>

    <title>Swimming, Chertsey, Angelina Ballerina, Rugby Semis</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy and Daddy came over about 9:30 to have a cup of tea and pick us up from the Fars. We had a lovely time and behaved very well - I don't believe it!</p><p>In the afternoon we went swimming over at Woking with the Weston and Elder clans. Daddy managed to get Ben onto the slow flume, although he was a little unsure. Katie apparently can swim the width of the pool, about 10 metres, at her lessons. However, we never see it when it comes to the weekend! From swimming we split. Katie and Mummy went to see Angelina Ballerina at Woking theatre. It was a ballet performance that was shorter than expected. Daddy took a unsettled Jessica and cheeky Benjamin to watch Chertsey play. I think Jessica cried throughout the whole game, and I don't blame her with that performance. Chertsey were beaten 5-0 against Cove. It was shocking and could have been more.</p><p>Today was a great day for sport. England were playing internationally at cricket, football and rugby. The Elders came over to watch the World Cup Semi Final. A closely fought affair between England and France. In a tense finish, the underdogs, England finished on top.</p>

    <title>Look Out</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie missed church for once and went out with Daddy for a bike ride. Ben and Jessica had to endure church with Mummy!</p><p>The weather was good and so in the afternoon we went over to a packed out Lookout and went to the playground. We then had a good game of tag in the woods. If Daddy was 'it', then you could gain safety by keeping to a tree, however only for 23 seconds then you wouldn't be safe anymore. We loved playing this game. Unfortunately we had to leave for home and get bathed and bedded. The Fars came over last thing to see us.</p>

    <title>Marwell Zoo</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie is on half term this week, so Mummy, Katie Ben and Jess went to Marwell zoo with Natasha and Nina. It was a lovely day and we all took a picnic. All the animals were active so we got a good view of them. we went on the land train which pleased Ben. We saw Auntie Karen's name  there as she sponsors a giraffe. The best bit for Katie was seeing the hippos come up and down in their pools of water for air as they made such a splash and they were right in front of us, it really made her laugh. We didn't leave until late so we were all really tired when we got home.</p>

    <title>Heathrow and Laleham</title>
    <info>
		<p>After church and lunch we went over to Heathrow airport to do a bit of plane spotting! Our usual place lay deserted of the other plane spotters, so we guessed the wind was blowing from the wrong direction. We instead went to the visitor centre and tried from there. We did see them land, it wasn't like the other place where they come right over our heads. We shifted over to Laleham to play in another playground by the Thames. I think Ben and Katie could live in a playground they love them so much. A terrible weekend for English sport was capped by Lewis Hamilton losing the formula 1 championship.</p>

    <title>Karen, Summer and Alice</title>
    <info>
		<p>Still on half term, so we drove to Gravesend and went to visit Auntie Karen and Summer and Alice, it was so cold but we were brave and went for a walk in Beacon Wood where we took bags and filled them with sticks and acorns etc. We saw millions of toadstools which fascinated the children as Mummy and Auntie Karen told them about the fairies that live under them. We went on the swings Mummy and Auntie Karen used to play on when we were Katie and Summers's age which was strange to think we'd be here 26 years later with our children! We stayed at Ma Ma and Pop Pops (Ma Ma was in India though) and had a lovely tea and bath.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Went to visit Auntie Fiona and Thomas today. We decorated pumpkin biscuits and played with all Thomas' toys. Katie was a bit off colour maybe due to her pre-school injections she had on Wednesday. We went to a great swing park with Thomas and then came home. Katie, Ben and Jess slept all the way home.</p>

    <title>Carpets and Garden Centre</title>
    <first name="jessica">Jessica's First Big Smile</first>
    <info>
		<p>The previous night Daddy went out with some of his FormScape friends after Debbie had served 7 years in the regime.</p><p>Mummy has a bee in her bonnet about getting new carpets. Not sure what has bought this on all of a sudden. Perhaps a lack of spending money for two minutes! Well there is Daddy's dig. Anyway we booked a couple of people to come and measure up and give us a quote.</p><p>We also looked for some charcoal for our new BBQ, without much luck. So after lunch Daddy, Katie and Jessica went to Badshot Lea to look for some and to visit the farm that was supposedly there. We couldn't find the farm, but did find an excellent collection of fish and lizard related animals. One waved at Katie which amused her.</p><p>We purchased some daffodil bulbs and charcoal, noticing the BBQ just purchased on the internet was £20 cheaper in the garden centre. Couldn't believe it. Just shows. We returned via a trip to the Hogs Back Brewery which Katie enjoyed.</p><p>The rest of the afternoon was spent gardening and planting our new bulbs. Katie and Ben like spending 10 minutes digging up the garden then lose patience. Daddy will make gardeners out of them yet.</p><p>The evening was spent in front of Strictly Come Dancing as usual. An excuse for Katie to wiggle her bum in front of Daddy and for Ben to run around in circles.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_10_28-01-JessicaSmile.jpg</src><caption>Smiling Jessica</caption></image><p>A bit sad I know but Daddy for some reason wanted to see George Galloway take apart the US Senate and then got into watching all videos of George Galloway. I previously thought he was crude and I didn't agree with his arguments. However, now I can agree with pretty much everything he says about the troubles in the middle east. A bit of politics. You didn't think you'd see that.</p>

    <title>BBQ’ed Sunday Roast - Battersea Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was a grim morning weather-wise and Katie and Ben didn't get the hours difference, so we had a 5am wakeup call! Ben and Jessica went to church, for their sins, whilst Katie and a determined Daddy were tending to Sunday lunch from 8:30 in the morning.</p><p>It was going to be a special roast cooked in the new BBQ. We weren't sure how it was going to turn out, especially as it was raining. It didn't start well as our one single match extinguished before it even got close to the newspaper. After a few attempts we finally got the show on the road and things were going along nicely. The pork was slapped on, as well as some potatoes and parsnips. Leave for 2 hours and hey presto a nice roast lunch.</p><p>
        In the afternoon we went with the Fars to<a href="http://www.batterseapark.org/">Battersea Park</a>. It was about the fourth attempt for us to spend an afternoon with them. Even though it was raining again, we were determined to 'do it' this time. The traffic was bad, but we arrived and the park looked great with so many old, large tree's showing their autumn colours. We first went to the playground where Ben drove us to Paris on his train. It was amusing to see four grown adults crammed inside a rail carriage designed for three year olds!
      </p><p>We eventually moved on and played hide and seek amongst the wet undergrowth of the aptly named 'Tropical Gardens'. Tropical is not an adjective I would use to describe a wet, cold, autumnal afternoon in London. We branched around to see the other delights of the park. The mini-maze thingy, a pagoda, a slab of marble that you could slide across, a view across the Thames and finally the fountains. An enjoyable time had by all. It would be a nice place to return and have a picnic in the summer.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_10_29-04-BatterseaPark.jpg</src><caption>Battersea Park</caption></image>

    <info>
		<p>The hairdresser was around today and once Mummy was 'on the chair', Katie went upstairs to pretend cut Ben's hair. Mummy went upstairs as it was all too quiet, only to find Ben nude. No nappy. Ben was keen to show that he had put something in the bin. It was a big hard poo! Nice. He must have picked it out of his nappy, and put it in the bin! Mmmm. Nice.</p>

    <title>Cross Farm Halloween Disco</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was Cross Farm's Halloween Disco and four of us dressed up in scary monster costumes, whilst Daddy dressed as himself which is scary enough! Boom, boom. Judging by the number of random mum's who came up, Jessica stole the show with her pumpkin outfit. She of course slept through the beats and sounds of the loud disco. Our evening didn't last that long. Initially Katie was dancing around and excited, Ben was just wandering around the dance floor looking lost - I know how he feels! But after a break from dancing Katie got whiney and eventually we could stand it no more and departed. Our children don't do well after 6pm, especially when they get up at 6am! Still it was nice to see all the other children as well having a good time.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_11_02-04-HalloweenDisco.jpg</src><caption>My Little Pumpkin</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_11_02-13-HalloweenDisco.jpg</src><caption>Katie and Ben Dancing Together (Ben in green, Katie in cat)</caption></image>

    <title>Hop Farm and Fireworks</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        We left early for Ma Ma and Pop Pop's on this bright, sunny morning. We played for a bit and received presents from Ma Ma's recent India trip, including a traditional outfit for Katie. We ventured off south towards Paddock Wood and after protest from Mummy at the admission charges we entered the
        <a href="http://thehopfarm.co.uk">
          Hop Farm
        </a>
        . There was a big climbing frame which had high, tube slides, some mini sized shops which the children loved. Katie was a grocer and a hairdresser. She played the parts very well.
      </p><p>We went to see the farm animals, of which there were not that many - to such an extent there were model animals standing in some of the pens! Ma Ma and Pop Pop treated us to a horsey ride - mechanical of course and then we went for a cup of tea, ice lolly and play area which was great. Just as we were leaving we bumped into Bob and Ellen who were coming in for the fireworks. What a coincidence seeing they live in Nottingham, 200 odd miles away!</p><p>We returned back home and hurried out to see some fireworks. After last year’s disaster we decided to go to Frimley Green Rec and stand on the hill to see all the fireworks around, at arm’s length. This was still too scary for the children! We had to settle to have our flask of soup and watch from inside the car. They slowly got into the fireworks, but still wouldn't dare go outside to see them! What a bunch of wimps.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/DSC00352a.jpg</src><caption>Benny's Bus</caption></image>

    <title>Great Grandma's 82nd Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>Another glorious, sunny day. After church Joey, Lily and Michael came over to play in the garage. Daddy took off Katie's stabilizers on her bike and had a go at getting her acclimatized to two wheels instead of four. The 10 minute session was telling Katie to keep looking forward and pedal, rather than relying Daddy pushing her. It could be a short lived effort as we are not sure if she is ready for this yet.</p><p>It was Great Grandma's 82nd birthday for which we celebrated with her and the family down at Camberley Indoor bowls club. All seven of her great grandchildren were there which was nice, if a little frenetic at times. We had a traditional Sunday Lunch.</p><p>In the evening we lit our sparklers and whizzed them around in the air. Tonight we were going to have an early night. 6pm lights out!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_11_04-08a-Joyce82Birthday-BenKatieSparklers.jpg</src><caption>What a sparkler</caption></image>

    <title>Tempest Rally and Swimming</title>
    <info>
		<p>A relatively warm, sunny day meant we could get out and about today. Katie had to do her homework. She currently has 10 keywords that she has to recognise, "I", "We", "He", "Went", "They", "It", "She" ... can't remember them all. She can get 9 out of 10 which is very good. She seems to get stuck on "They" for some reason. Also earlier this week, Katie swum 2 widths of the swimming pool, with a small break between turning. That's about 15 metres. Daddy has yet to see it yet, or anything close to that.</p><p>Mummy, as she repeated a number of times, had a headache, so she was quite brave to take Katie and Jessica swimming. Thankfully Jessica slept the whole time at the side of the pool, allowing Mummy and Katie to be mermaids!</p><p>
        The boys instead went to the<googlelink link="Tempest+Rally">Tempest Rally</googlelink>of Southern England. We eventually found a place to park and went in to see the two wheel drive stage in the Warren, which is a gravel stage through woods, next to Blackbushe Airport.
      </p><p>Ben enjoyed himself as we played 'guess the colour of the next car'. We first picked an open fast straight where we saw a lot of old Escort's which pleased Daddy. Ben's favourite were the blue cars.</p><p>We then moved around to a place where there was a big dip, with a hidden trap. Cars taking an inside line too much would fall into some deep mud, which the first car we saw enter, managed to struggle out after some needed spectator participation. The second car we saw however had no such luck. As Ben said "Blue car stuck in the deep, deep mud - tractor get it out."</p><p>We'd run out of time, but father and son had some good time together. Definitely one for next year.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_11_10-03-BenJessica.jpg</src><caption>Ben and Jessica</caption></image>

    <title>Elders Over and Return Of The Jedi</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy attempted another Sunday roast on the BBQ against the rain and cold. The chicken didn't taste as good as the pork - not sure that'll be attempted again.</p><p>The Elders came around to play in the afternoon. Lily is really a very smiley little lady. Joey of course wanted to go on Daddy's motorbike.</p><p>In the late afternoon Return Of The Jedi was on the TV. Ben, not known for sitting still for too long watched the whole lot which pleased Daddy immensely. He just sat there very quiet in attentively. He was such a good boy with his dinner and bath as well. Where has 'ants pants' gone and his naughty streak?</p>

    <title>Fars And Swimming</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went around to see the Fars to wreck their house! In inevitable train track was wheeled out and apparently only Daddy and Farfar can build a track as Mummy and Farmor are rubbish! After train tracks we built a camp under the dining room table then out of the sofa seats! Auntie Susan turned up and little later to join in. We escaped quickly before having to clear up!</p><p>Later in the day we ventured over to Farnborough to go swimming. Jessica was a little under the weather, so we left her on the side like Mummy did last week. However, this week we were told this was not allowed. Not sure why. This meant Mummy had to get out of the pool, which made things less safe as Daddy now had to keep an eye on Katie and Ben. Still we had a good time playing sharks and boats. Katie is getting very confident in the water. She still hasn't displayed the swimming abilities that she shows at her lessons, but she has no problem in going under water.</p><p>Ben kept going on about Star Wars, looking at the pictures in the house, and pointing out characters on the DVD cover, however when Daddy tried to watch the first film, Ben only lasted 20 minutes before sloping off into the kitchen where Mummy and Katie were making fairy cakes.</p><p>Israel beat Russia in an important qualifier game which pleased Daddy lots and lots. England might now qualify. Denmark lost which means they won't.</p><p>Daddy also managed to get hold of an old Xbox this week which means we can play films on the TV, and have a DVD player that reliably works!</p><p>Ben is calling Jessica, 'Jessica Lukys'. Not sure where he has got that from.</p>

		<p>Another wintery, wet and frankly horrible day. Daddy continued the work on the patio whilst the ladies and Ben went to church.</p><p>In the afternoon, another well organised trip out from Mummy to a softplay in Goldsworth Park. We met up with the Elders, Ma Ma and Pop Pop. Ma Ma was a trooper climbing in, out and around the apparatus like a 4 year old! We stayed for quite a while, 3 hours I think, by which time we had explored all areas and tired the children out.</p>

There was a good turn out with many old faces showing up, including Mike Collis, Chris Mann, Phil C, David Weaver and the usual faces.</p><p>We were, for some reason with Laura track record, entrusted to feed Karen and Rich's cat, Kesia. Katie and Ben made themselves at home. Not for long as the garden centre next door had Father Christmas trotting in with his horse and carriage much to the delight of Katie and Ben, who are really getting in to F.C. and Christmas.</p><p>On our way to Lily's first birthday gathering, we went stopped off at Upper Foyle where Daddy, Katie and Ben tried the wooden playground out for well over an hour. We had fun playing crocodiles and Katie married Ben in the castle.</p><p>We scooted over to the Elders where there was a family gathering for Lily. She's a little belter, constantly smiling away. We had a nice buffet, organised a motor biking holiday with Howard next summer in Scotland and had some chocolate birthday cake.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_01-38-Lily1stBirthdayParty.jpg</src><caption>Family shot</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_01-34-Lily1stBirthdayParty.jpg</src><caption>The Children</caption></image><p>We returned home before Daddy went out to Guildford to meet up with his Ex-FormScapers, taking advantage for the first time of the new extended licensing laws...

    <title>Christmas Shopping</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went to Basingstoke to do some Christmas shopping. Mummy wants to break the bank, whilst Daddy is a scrooge! We were hoping for Ben to see Father Christmas but unfortunately there were just 3 angles. However there was a good train ride beforehand.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_03-04-ChristmasShoppingBasingstoke.jpg</src><caption>Polar Express</caption></image>

    <title>David and Lisa's Wedding</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        Lisa and David (our great, great aunt's, grandson) got married today in Apsley, Hertfordshire. The weather, as in four out of five of this year's weddings was not kind to us. It chucked it down. We scrambled into the back of
        <googlelink link="st+marys+apsley">
          St Mary's church
        </googlelink>
        . Lisa walked down the aisle and Katie said she looked like a princess. It was a lovely service with a lot of children involved which was nice to see.
      </p><p>We made our way to Berkhampstead Town Hall for a swift drink, a little wiping away of Jessica's sick from the suit and a go on the bouncy castle which Katie and Ben absolutely loved. David kindly pulled us in for a photo which Daddy especially appreciated.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_08-06-DavidLisaWedding.jpg</src><caption>With the wedded couple</caption></image><p>Sausages were on the menu, a firm favourite for us all. We shared a table with the Fars, Graham and Susan. The children were entertained by some comics and toys and by Uncle Graham blowing bubbles. Lisa also came over to speak to the children. Ben was measuring her up with his Bob The Builder tape !</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_08-16a-DavidLisaWedding.jpg</src><caption>Ben measuring up Lisa</caption></image><p>The best part of the day, other than the wedding of course, was when David was making his speech and he went into a sort of crying high pitched squeal which turned very quickly into laughter. Hard to describe, but a quality moment, with a quality get out. We left Daddy at the wedding as the rest of us went home.</p><p>We were gutted to leave early as we missed the huge chocolate fountain that must have been 8 foot high and cheesy Abba music from the disco. A really nice wedding with so many nice touches to it. Thanks David and Lisa and good luck.</p>

    <title>The Danish Crew To Visit</title>
    <info>
		<p>Lise and Jørgen are currently on holiday with their nephew Morton and his family. Yesterday they went to see Reading beat Liverpool. Today they came over to visit and have a cup of coffee. Mathias, the 10 year old boy, was very entertaining with his light up red fingers and had Katie especially on his tail. Julie wasn't feeling too well and left to go to Frimley Park Hospital.</p><p>Lise and Jørgen were on good form and it was very nice to see them again, although it was a little frenetic in the house with eleven of us.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_09-02a-LiseJørgenMathiasKatie.jpg</src><caption>Lise, Jørgen,Mathias and Katie playing</caption></image>

    <title>Cinderella Pantomime</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie for some reason wasn't looking forward to going to see Cinderella at Camberley Civic Centre. I think she was scared that there were going to be nasty characters. This emotion poured over to Ben who was also reluctant to go.</p><p>The Weston’s came to Camberley and carted Jessica around the shops, with Grandma and Grandad. We sat down, with Katie looking the wrong way and Ben on Mummy's lap. Within five minutes Katie and Ben were won over and enjoying the performance.</p><p>Even Mummy and Daddy enjoyed the show, especially with many of the improvised scenes as one of the actors wigs fell off, various hecklers both young and old and a place where they had to go off and read the script as they had forgotten their lines!</p><p>The best characters were the ugly sisters and buttons. Katie and Ben enjoyed themselves loads. A definite booking for next year again.</p>

    <title>Katie's Carol Concert</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie had her first school carol concert today. Auntie Ellie looked after Ben so Mummy could watch without worrying Ben would be running around. Jessica was a very good girl and Katie was wonderful. The minute Mummy saw Katie, her tears started, she tried to sing all the words, all from memory as obviously she can't read the words yet. They sang traditional carols and some songs from the nativity play, it was great.</p>

The morning was spent raiding the Fars house and making a mess!</p><p>It was Thomas's 2nd birthday, we travelled across to the Kent-Surrey border to Manic Monsters, that's a softplay place you know.</p><p>Thomas was busy playing as was Katie, Ben and the other youngsters. We think it was the best softplay we've been to. Loads of room, not too busy, good slides, football area and a brilliant kart-buggy track.</p><p>It was a lovely birthday for Thomas.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_22-16-Thomas2ndBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Thomas smoking a sausage on his birthday</caption></image>

Ben got a radio controlled car and some trains, whilst Katie received a Barbie and a trip with Karen to a teddy bear factory.</p><p>Katie and Ben played well with Freya. We played the easiest game of hide and seek ever. I don't think the children get the concept of hiding! There was a lot of tidying up.</p><p>In the evening Steven came over for a cup of tea and a mince pie and to give some presents.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_23-05a-KatieBenFreyaXmas.jpg</src><caption>Presents, Presents, Presents</caption></image>

    <title>Christmas Eve With The Gays</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy had to go to work in the morning and Katie wasn't feeling too great. Ben and Mummy on the other hand were really looking forward to Christmas.</p><p>We made our way over to the Fars at 4pm for a traditional Danish Christmas, the first for a few years now. As is normal all the toys were requested to come out. Ben was quite taken by the Snowman on the TV, whilst Katie lost patience and went to help Farmor in the kitchen. Jessica wasn't playing ball. She cried for most of the three hours that we were over, which meant Daddy and Mummy took it in turns to settle her down during dinner.</p><p>We had some lovely pork, caramelized potatoes, red cabbage, boiled potatoes, trees (broccoli) and carrots followed by Ris Alamonde and butterscotch tart. We could hold the children back no longer (Mummy is included as a child) and we huddled around the tree and Katie and Ben distributed the gifts, and then opened most of them for us at a great rate of knots.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_24-02-ChristmasEveFars.jpg</src><caption>Danish Christmas Meal</caption></image><p>Katie and Jessica got a cute pair of big sister / little sister t-shirts and Ben got some boys toys: a digger and some Duplo.</p><p>Seven O’clock struck and Cinders had to get back home and leave out the reindeer food, mince pie and a glass of milk for Father Christmas and his entourage.</p><p>Daddy returned to the Fars to play Poo Head.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_24-21-ChristmasEveFars.jpg</src><caption>Present Opening</caption></image>

    <title>Christmas Day</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie woke around 3am to feel presents on her feet. Father Christmas has been. However, it wasn't until a tardy 5:15 before she was awake for the day. Katie and Ben were very patient until 6am when we all piled into their bedroom to see what Father Christmas had delivered. I think he over delivered! Ben received a Thomas Tank Engine train set and Katie her Baby Annabel amongst 20 other presents!</p><p>After opening that lot we moved into Mummy and Daddy's room to see their stockings. Daddy must have been a naughty boy as he got a set of 10 biros and a notepad from Tesco cheapo range... although he did get a very nice jumper. Mummy got a pair of jeans and a wooden floor as well as some pegs for the washing line!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_25-03-Christmasday.jpg</src><caption>Mummy and Daddy's present opening</caption></image><p>We then made our way downstairs to open presents from friends from under the Father Christmas tree (as Ben calls it).</p><p>We got dressed in our Christmas gear, Katie in her pretty spotty dress and Ben in his new full Superman outfit, but he told us that he 'can't fly though'.</p><p>We popped over to the Fars again for Christmas breakfast and whilst mummy went to church, the rest of us opened the rest of the Gay presents, had a sing song along with some vinyl records (we sad they were big CD's). Mummy returned and we ventured east to Kent.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_25-14-Christmasday.jpg</src><caption>Christmas Breakfast</caption></image><p>We arrived at the Weston's where the Elders were also staying.... so it became quite congested. We saw Lily and Joey's presents and prepared for Christmas Lunch.</p><p>Turkey with all the trimmings. It's always a competition to see who can clean their plate. This year it went to Charlotte, Daddy, Mummy, Michael and Pop Pop. The children all sat at the end but weren't quite as greedy as the adults.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_25-25-Christmasday.jpg</src><caption>Christmas Lunch</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_25-57-Christmasday.jpg</src><caption>Pop Pop and Jessica Nose To Nose</caption></image><p>After the cleanup operation, Katie and Ben were the little elves who delivered yet more presents. A contrast in styles to the Gay's where it is a bit more pedestrian, the Weston's race through the presents. We all got loads. Ben got a Postman Pat tent, Katie a magnetic atlas and singing teddy bear and Jessica some bath toys.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_25-63-Christmasday.jpg</src><caption>Superman!</caption></image><p /><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_25-01-ChristmasJessica.jpg</src><caption>Various of one of our gorgeous girls</caption></image><p>After some nibbles the kiddies went to bed whilst the grownups watched some tele and played games.</p>

    <title>Greenwich, Barnett Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>After an interesting night's sleep Daddy, Uncle Michael, Katie, Ben, Joey and Lily all went up to Greenwich for a tour around. We started at the desolate playground. Benny kept falling over when he was running and got a couple of scrapes, one which covered half his face in mud! Typical Ben.</p><p>Katie was on her new scooter and Joey on his new bike. They were loving a run around. Katie and Joey were caught a little short and done a little wee in the drained boating lake! Slow Joe eventually made his way out of the park as we walked though the town to the river side. It was pretty disappointing. The location of the Cutty Sark looked like a building site and Goddard's, Mummy and Daddy's special Pie and Mash shop, had been taken over by a chain restaurant. Really, really disappointed about that. Feels a little bit of something special about Greenwich had gone.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_26-24-Greenwich.jpg</src><caption>Greenwich Park Gates</caption></image><p>Uncle Michael and Daddy weren't proud of our lunch choice but McDonalds was an easy choice.</p><p>After fish fingers and chips, we had fun trying to get down to the Dockland Light Railway station with a double buggy. 20 minutes later we made it down and chilled out on the platform. We piled into a busy train and meandered through the Docklands to Canary Wharf. So many tall buildings. We found a ramp to race down on foot, bike and scooter, so we pretended to be skater boys and girls. Daddy fell off the scooter which was funny. Time was marching on, so we walked over to India Quay and took the train and car back to Istead Rise.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_26-40a-Greenwich.jpg</src><caption>Down and outs on the DLR</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_26-50-Greenwich.jpg</src><caption>Canary Wharf Children</caption></image><p>We arrived to find Helen and Nigel had popped over for a cuppa, then came the traditional Barnett party. Lots of games, some even had answers to the quiz questions! A surprisingly lack of cheating going on. The highlight was definitely Granddad’s Family Fortune's. The effort and delivery were unique.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Daddy jogged over to Farnborough Rec and met the rest of us for Jessica's first swim. She loved it and spent half an hour in the coldish pool. Ben couldn't wait to get in the pool, dropping his trousers as soon as we got in the changing room! Ben and Katie are getting allot more confident in the water, Katie although not swimming too great is as happy under the water as above. We invented a new game called hippo's - a bit like horsey's but in the water!</p>

    <title>GWR Steam Museum - Sine Christening</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        We embarked on a weekend break down to Wiltshire centring around Sine christening. First stop was scenic Swindon and it's thousand roundabouts! The
        <a href="http://www.steam-museum.org.uk/">
          Great Western Railway Steam Museum
        </a>
        was primarily for Ben's benefit, however, he didn't seem that interested in the steam engines really. Daddy had to be dragged around! I think you have to be a bit of a train nerd to enjoy this place.
      </p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_30-12-SteamMuseumSineChristening.jpg</src><caption>North Star</caption></image><p>We stopped off outside in the freezing cold for a picnic, before going around the adjoining shopping centre to warm up.</p><p>We drove down to our holetel (Hotel) just outside Warminster. Katie and Ben love hotels. Such adventure. We dumped our bags, made ourselves look beautiful and went off to Frome for the christening.</p><p>We parked outside the church and waited in the car as we were a bit early. Five minutes before we ventured up to the church. However it was pitch black. Something not right here. We asked a local and we'd gone to the wrong church! We made it to St Alexandra's and settled down near the front. Sine (pronounced Sheena) is the daughter of Jessica, Mummy's friend from school. We hadn't seen her and Jon since their wedding four years ago, so it was a surprise and a pleasure to be invited down. It was a catholic service which is a bit different to the C of E services we normally attend. Thankfully families were welcome, as Katie and Ben treated the place like an assault course! Jessica squawked quite a bit as well. Sine was christened and we went across to the hall for some nibbles and to catch up with Vicky Deacon and Jessica.</p><p>We returned late back to the hotel via a pizza shop. Katie and Ben still excited to be in a hotel slept head to toe.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2007/2007_12_30-21-SteamMuseumSineChristening.jpg</src><caption>Head to Toe</caption></image>

    <title>Warminster Walk, White Horse Walk, New Years Eve Party With Elders</title>
    <info>
		<p>Sleeping all in one room guaranteed an early wake up call. Katie and Ben were itching to get out, so Daddy got them changed outside in the corridor at 6:30, leaving Mummy and Jessica to have a lovely lye in.</p><p>The three early birds decided to go for a walk in Warminster where Ben developed a 'bad boy strut'. Looked like he had been shot in the leg, but apparently he was skipping! It was still dark but we had fun walking up and down the high street.</p><p>We made it back and looked and looked for the car keys. We couldn't find them anywhere. Then Katie produced them from inside of the kettle where she had played with them and left them there! We gave a sigh of relief and ventured off to Sainsbury's to get some breakfast. Talk about trusting a brand. We travelled a 16 mile round trip just to eat breakfast there! Madness.</p><p>
        We then were feeling brave and drove to the<googlelink link="White+Horse+Westbury">White Horse</googlelink>. We wrapped up and nervously walked around the surrounding area and had our picnic. The horse was on a really steep bit of the hill.

We played with Joey and Lily and pretended that it was midnight so we could sing Auld Lang Syne and have a drink. We went to bed leaving the grownups to have a lovely Fajitas (thanks Ellie) and play some really, really good games we got for Christmas! :)</p><p>Some were flagging come the real midnight, but we celebrated with a glass of Champers. An end to another eventful year.</p>

    <title>Ben - Southampton Airport</title>
    <info>
		<p>With Mummy at a funeral and Daddy first day back at work after Christmas, Ben spent the day with the Fars by first playing at their house for an hour then going out on a sunny but very sharp day to see aeroplanes at Southampton Airport. The journey down to Hampshire was by train from Farnborough which was an extra bonus.</p><p>After having a pizza lunch, we went outside on to the top of the car park to see the aeroplanes take off and land. Being quite a small airport there was only one movement roughly every fifteen minutes but the view of what was happening on the apron and runway was excellent. We stayed there for almost an hour in the cold but Ben never complained once and was always interested until we took the warm mid afternoon train home again.</p>

    <title>Ben - Peter Pan Pantomime</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ben spent a great day with my Ma Ma, Granddad, grandma, Uncle Peter and Uncle Howard. We went to the pantomime to see Peter Pan, there were no scary men in it. Ben wanted an ice cream but when Ma Ma bought one, Ben found he didn't want it after all so Uncle Peter had two! After Peter Pan was finished we said goodbye to everyone but Ma Ma couldn't find her car. Luckily Uncle Peter turned up and helped us find it and said he would come home with us. Ben slept all the way home.</p><p>When we got in we watched Superman, then had some tea and a bath and went to bed. Ma Ma slept with Ben and he woke once for a drink. (author: Ma Ma)</p>

		<p>
        In the morning when Ma Ma woke up we played trains. Then Pop Pop took us to Tenterden where we had a drink in a pub. Ben really liked this and hoped to see more of these sort of places in the distant future. After this we went on the

        to Dungerness. Following rather a nice lunch, I had a chip and one bite of an ice lolly, we returned home.
      </p><p>Mummy, Katie and Jessica turned up and we had a little party before setting off for home. I think Ma Ma and Pop Pop had tears in their eyes when we said goodbye. (author: Ma Ma)</p>

		<p>In the morning we cleared the garage of the old carpet and had two trips to the dump. Interesting! We also played pirates and Katie was 'Spack Jarrow', which made us laugh. Not quite Jack Sparrow out of Pirates of the Caribbean!</p><p>We went to Farnborough and met with the Fars. There was an temporary ice skating rink. Daddy felt a right gypo. This is the snob rising out, but we were in Asda car park, with the down and outs of Farnborough, ice skating on a mobile, acrylic, 10 metre squared rink. Saying that the children didn't care. Katie absolutely loved the fact she couldn't keep her feet as mummy and daddy led her around. Ben also had a short go.</p><p>We moved onto King George V fields and showed the Fars our favourite playground.</p>

Mummy was a bit vocal at her disgust with the state of the place for our liking, especially as all the housemates were quiet in their bedrooms!</p><p>After the tour of the house, we ventured into Bournemouth and walked down from the cliff top down to the pier and beach area. It was pretty windy and cold, but Daddy and Katie rolled up their trousers and went paddling. Not for long though as it was so cold it hurt! We snapped a line-up picture, then quickly seeked somewhere out of the wind.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_01_19-03-Bournemouth.jpg</src><caption>Brazing and Brave at Bournemouth Beach</caption></image><p>We ate our lunch in Winter Gardens and then mooched around the high street, stopping for a hot, rhubarb and custard Shakeaway. Katie and Ben were getting a little tired, so we ventured back to the car and got home quickly.</p><p>Daddy and Katie then went out for a longish bike ride until it got dark. Lovely Jubbly.</p><p>We stopped feeding Jessica solids as she had a massive sick tonight.</p>

		<p>We went to the church New Year’s Party. Katie and Ben played all the games, pass the parcel, Simon says, musical bumps and statues. There was a raffle, everyone got a ticket free and Katie loved hers and wrote her name on it. All the way through the raffle, she was waiting for her number 182 to come up. Mummy was really hoping it would as Katie would have been so upset. Luckily it did get called out and Katie picked out a necklace and Ben won a car, Joey got a chocolate reindeer, and mummy a big box of chocolates. Katie and Ben also loved the chocolate game where you dress up and cut the chocolate with a knife and fork, they couldn't  believe their luck. Ma Ma and Uncle Peter won the quiz which pleased them.</p>

    <title>Joey's 3rd Birthday, Wembley Football, Shopping</title>

		<p>We went to Joey's big 3rd birthday party who he was sharing with two of his NCT friends. It was held at the Country Market, same place as last year. There was lots to play with including a bouncy castle which Daddy threw us across as we played Superman. There was also a craft table where Katie, Ben and Jessica all made crowns!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_02_02-08-Joey3rdBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Pass The Parcel</caption></image><p>Lilly has started to walk her first few steps so it won't be long until she is running around with the others. Freya also came along to play with us lot. Ma Ma eventually turned up after some legendry organization of the location of the party. Still we laughed.</p><p>After three sets of Happy Birthday's and a slice of cake, the girls went off with Ma Ma to do some clothes shopping, whilst the boys went off to football.</p><p>It was a bitterly cold day and only the hardened turned up for the Combined Counties clash at Wembley. Not THE Wembley, but Wembley F.C. Ben actually was interested in watching the game for about 2 minutes. I think he'll like football when he gets older. He was very much in 'Why' mood. Everything was proceeded with a long 'Whhhyyy?'.</p><p>After a well fought 1-1 draw we said our goodbyes to Farfar and returned home. The 'Lodger' came and stayed the night, whilst Daddy made 5 bazillion sandwiches and Mummy went to set the bowls club up with Grandma and Granddad. Alan and Linda came down and spent the night at the Fars.</p>

    <title>Jessica's Christening - St Andrew's Church, Frimley Green</title>
    <info>
		<p>Getting ready before the service was uncommonly calm and stress free. We got to St. Andrews 15 minutes before the service started and thankfully all the godparents were there, which was no mean feat, as some travelled from afar and some with kiddies.</p><p>Scott, the vicar made us feel very welcome and performed a lovely service. It seemed special as it was integrated with the regular service which only happened because all of us are regular church go-ers. Well almost all of us. Daddy always seems to have a headache or something when Sunday morning comes!</p><p>Jessica was certainly the star of the show. She behaved impeccably throughout the service. Katie and Ben went to crèche, as the vicar opened with a joke about how you never see children again at church after they have been christened.</p><p>The godparents: Fiona Burrows, Karen Teale, Graham Tremear and Richard Sanders all came to the font of the church along with the five of us as Jessica was christened. Jessica was carried around the church by the vicar to show her off. She was a star.</p><p>We retrieved Katie and Ben's christening candles which were lit in front of everyone. Katie made the congregation laugh when she blew hers out, just like a birthday candle!</p><p>The service drew to an end and Uncle Philip took a few photos of us by the font. We gave a cake for everyone in the congregation and made off to Mytchett bowls club for the celebrations.</p><p>It was so nice to see so many different people from both sides of the family and friends to. There were quite a few kiddies who played with a few of the toys we brought. Luckily the playground was only just outside and was new. However, it was pretty cold to stay out there for too long.</p><p>We would all like to say a big thank you to everyone who helped us on the day. Farmor, Susan, Ellie, Ma Ma and Grandma for providing the food, to Mytchett bowls club for letting us have use of their clubhouse on the cheap, and to Scott and St Andrew's church for actually christening Jessica. And thanks for all the so many wonderful presents which we opened in the afternoon. Fantastic, although some of the cards had fallen from the present itself, so it was difficult to know who gave what!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_02_03-01a-JessicaChristening.jpg</src><caption>Church Gathering</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_02_03-02a-JessicaChristening.jpg</src><caption>Lils and Yasmin</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_02_03-03-JessicaChristening.jpg</src><caption>Ella and Katie</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_02_03-04-JessicaChristening.jpg</src><caption>Mytchett Bowls Club</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_02_03-06a-JessicaChristening.jpg</src><caption>Farmor and Helen</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_02_03-10-JessicaChristening.jpg</src><caption>Barrie and Laura</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_02_03-11-JessicaChristening.jpg</src><caption>Alan, Linda and Farfar</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_02_03-13-JessicaChristening.jpg</src><caption>Lisa, Yasmin and David</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_02_03-17-JessicaChristening.jpg</src><caption>Ma Ma, Karen and Bradley</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_02_03-18-JessicaChristening.jpg</src><caption>Karen and Jessica</caption></image>

          walk in London
        </a>
        . We drove up to Turnham Green, but were unable to park in our normal spot, so went across to Chiswick Park, only to find the tube was shut for engineering works! So after we changed Jessica's nappy in a bus shelter on Chiswick High Street, she had gone right through 2 sets of clothes layers! We caught the 27 bus to Chalk Farm. This 80 minute bus journey certainly tested the staying power of all the children. All had a little sleep. It was nice to go through some bits of London which we hadn't seen.
      </p><p>
        We cut through Camdem High Street, which incidentally went down in a
        <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7237119.stm">
          big fire that night
        </a>
        ! The bus finally halted at Chalk Farm Morrisons. Nice. We then walked up the very relaxed and trendy Primrose Hill Road. It was lovely. Around the corner was the grassy hill itself with good views over London, better than Hampstead Heath in my opinion.
      </p><p>Ben instantly found a lady friend of a similar age. The old dog managed to get a few hugs off her.... and he introduced me as "And that's my Daddy", which everyone (25 people) on top of hill heard and some laughed. We had our usually horrible picnic and walked down to the swings and play there for a bit.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_02_09-41-London.jpg</src><caption>Katie on Primrose Hill</caption></image><p>The children were getting ever so tired and we struggled passed London Zoo and strolled through Regents Park and headed to St Pancreas station as Ben wanted to see the Eurostar trains. Unfortunately he was asleep in the pushchair and Mummy didn't have the heart to wake him up. The station looked great after the refurbishment. We took some photo's, dreamed about affording a thimble full of champers at the champagne bar, £7.50 a glass was the cheapest!</p><p>We then headed back, only to find the bus replacement service was severely clogged up at Hammersmith! Not ideal when you have Ben saying "my legs are breaking!"</p>

        After church, Katie and Ben went out with Farmor and Farfar to<a href="www.birdworld.co.uk">Birdworld</a>near Farnham. The day was very bright and the temperature was the highest of the year. We had a ride on a road train and saw emus, ostriches and vultures, as well as penguins. We then had lunch of fish and chips and after we hired a little car like trolley and took turns being pushed around by Farfar.
      </p><p>On that drive we saw parrots and pink flamingos who were standing on one leg. We also played on the slides and climbing frames as well as going into the pets farm. We were both uncomfortable in having chickens and turkeys walk right up to us. Luckily, the crocodiles (Caymans) that we later saw in Underwater World were behind thick glass and could not get at us, so we we able to be far braver. (Thanks to Farfar for this contribution)</p><p>We then went straight over the Church Crookham for Karen Sanders' birthday party. Her immediate family were there and we all had a go at playing Twister! The tea was finished off with some lovely cakes and puddings. Mummy and Karen went off to Woking to watch Mama Mia, whilst Daddy got the full 90 minute Jessica crying treatment at home!</p>

    <info>
		<p>We met up with the Elders in Southsea where we first went swimming in the Pyramids. The water I think was being pumped in from the sea as it was pretty cold. Anyway we all had fun jumping into the pool and going on the flumes.</p><p>We then had a picnic by the castle on the seafront before walking along towards the funfair. We spotted the hovercraft coming in to land on the beach and then leave again. Us older children had a couple of rides on the fairground. We then headed towards the playground where the coldness finally beat us and we made our way home.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_02_16-16-Southsea.jpg</src><caption>Southsea</caption></image>

    <title>Playing Football</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today was very much a chill out day. The weather continued to be very sunny and very cold. After church we headed off to the 'Garden Of Eden Swings'. Daddy and Ben went the scenic route through the woods on the bike, whilst the ladies went by foot, pushchair and bike. Jessica had a little go in the swing which she enjoyed. For some reason she would stare at the pivot points on the swing as to enquire if they are safe or not!</p><p>We then played football which Katie showed particular enthusiasm for. Ben on the other hand was in one of those 'tired moods'. If things do not go 100% his way then tears and general grumpiness ensues! Quite funny from a distance really.</p>

    <title>Heatherside Stroll</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Mummy had written a job list out for us all. Hers seemed remarkably light, whilst the rest of us went to the garden to spread manure! After lunch we went to Heatherside swings. The girls by foot and scooter, the boys went on the bike and detoured via the ranges where we saw some big army trucks and camps which Ben enjoyed seeing.</p><p>The swings at Heatherside were accosted by the hoy-poloy of Heatherside which made Mummy and Daddy feel uneasy because of the difficulties they seem to have of stringing a sentence together without swearing in the middle of it. We schmoozed over to the shops where Katie and Ben were treated to some sweeties and Mummy a cakey.</p><p>On the way home there were definitely two camps. As Katie put it "We're outdoor people [Daddy and Katie]" as Ben and Mummy were looking forward to getting to a warm snuggley house. So Daddy and Katie went to a second set of swings at the Cheylsmore estate where we made some friends on the Monkey bars.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_02_23-28a-Katie.jpg</src><caption>Smiley Katie Eyes</caption></image><p>Jessica is a funny old bean. During the day she is as happy as Larry, giving Daddy especially some big smiles. At night time it is a completely different story. She wakes and cries continually. We, or should I say Mummy has tried various strategies: From ignoring the cries, to cuddling, from feeding solids to not, from in the cot to in our bed. We still have yet to have a good night's sleep. Daddy still on the sofa! She is getting a bit old for the colic excuse so we are a little worried as to what is wrong.</p>

		<p>It was an early start as we went off to Heathrow airport to meet Ma Ma, Pop Pop and Howard from their holiday to Quebec and Montreal. We stopped to have a coffee and got some nice holiday presents.</p><p>After Sunday lunch the Fars popped over for a short while to play after which we moved onto Jakes, Bagshot which was the location of Freya's belated 3rd birthday party. It was nice to catch up again. In the football cage, the Daddies were playing keepy-upys, Jessica inadvertently joined in when the ball rebounded off her forehead!</p><p>The children played some games in a small room then had some party food and of course a birthday cake.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_02_24-12-FreyaBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Jessica Playing With Farmor</caption></image>

		<p>what a lovely day for mummy. In the morning She was invited to Ben's pre-school to listen to them singing some songs. Ben was lovely as he had only been there a few days so he could do the actions but didn't know the words but he tried singing anyway. He looked so little compared to the others. In the afternoon Mummy went to cross farm to listen to Katie singing songs. It was wonderful, Katie looked so happy and Mummy was very proud.</p>

    <title>Snipedy Snip Snip</title>
    <info>
		<woops woopstitle="Jogged the 'Snip' surgeon" rating="8"><p>I went into having the 'snip' with a stiff upper lip and tried to be as ignorant as possible as to what the procedure entailed. Well after the bazillionth consultation, I entered the op theatre, or should I say a room at the doctor's surgery. The first thing that hit me was the electrical burning smell. Ah ha this must be the torture chamber!</p><p>The surgeon told me to lie down. He was first quite brutal in getting everything into position and then whilst casually chatting a needle was injected somewhere down below. It makes me wince just writing it now. Arrgghhh. The pain was pretty severe and I must admit I did make a groaning noise. I also immediately jerked my knee up as a natural reaction. The surgeon asked me to not to do that as it was "jogging his steady hand"! Probably the last person you would want to jog! I thought of saying you try and lie here and have someone inject your bits. I could feel whatever fluids being inserted entering my system which wasn't a pleasant feeling either.</p><p>The procedure continued. By this time I didn't know whether to be tense, as the slightest move brought some pain, or whether to relax to give my heart a chance to slow down! For 90% of the time I braced myself whilst trying to make polite conversation!  Anyway, I couldn't feel the actual fusing of the tubes. All I could hear was a buzz now and again, sounding like a loose electrical connection. This I presume was the burning/fusing part.</p><p>Then all of a sudden. BAM. Another injection equally as painful as the first and totally unexpected. Another hit. I assume it was one for each testicle. I kept it together and saw out the ten minute operation.</p><p>I put some tight swimming trunks on, had a coffee and went down to meet the family. They were pleased to see me. Ben came charging right for me. I think I almost gave him a forearm smash to stop him running into where nature didn't intend! Anyway I had to check if there was much blood coming from the wound, which there wasn't, so I was able to go home.</p></woops><p>The rest of the day was spent convalescing in front of the TV.</p>

    <title>Natasha Grace Burrows - Weston’s</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went over to see the new arrival of Natasha into the Burrows family. There was some scary conversation on the way from Mummy about when were people invented? .. and how along ago was 10000BC!</p><p>Natasha looked a real cutie and so small, I think the smallest we've seen. She was born two weeks prematurely and weighed 6lbs 9oz. She was asleep for most of our visit. Ben and Katie made themselves at home straight away playing in Thomas' bedroom. We played a bit on Kelly's Wii which was funny.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_03_09-NatashaBurrows.jpg</src><caption>Natasha Burrows</caption></image><p>We bid our farewells and spent the afternoon in Gravesend with the Ma Ma and Pop Pop playing shoe shops and looking at their Canada holiday snaps.</p><p>

    <title>Five Gays travelling on four trains to three parks through two markets and a Farm</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        We embarked on an epic tour between Dalston, Hackney and Bethnal Green. Here's
        <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=111027506527990496626.00044880eddfe7df9c399&amp;ll=51.540543,-0.06609&amp;spn=0.019325,0.045319&amp;z=15">
          our tour
        </a>
        . We began, as ever, rushing for the train from Sunningdale. Daddy dropped us off whilst he went off somewhere to park (for free of course). Daddy just made the train, he ran to a carriage about two down from where the rest of us had got on! Phew. The train took us to Richmond where we changed for the 'North Circular' train to Dalston Kingsland. In the rush we mistakenly took Jessica in her car seat, so we were burdened with carrying that around with us as well as Katie's scooter, the picnic rucksack and changing bag.
      </p><p>We stepped out of the station to a typically gritty, untidy, multi-cultural, hustle and bustle of an unfashionable part of London. Daddy loved it for this. A part of London where a section of the Gay family originated. We explored the food market opposite, which was aimed at the locals. There were plenty of lovely fish, meat and fruit stalls as well as fake footwear and dodgy mobile phone fixers. We quickly moved on and walked a long way to London Fields where we surprisingly saw a lido that was open and with people swimming. Bearing in mind it was not the warmest of March days, it was refreshing to see some dedicated, hardened locals make use of this facility. It looked nice and clean and certainly one for the summer, especially as there is free parking nearby.</p><p>We were getting a bit tired and hungry so we de-camped at the swings for a bite to eat. There was one of those rope, pyramid apparatus that rises about 10 metres up. Well whilst Katie and Daddy were on it a little girl, slipped and fell down from near the top. It's one of those heart in the mouth times. Fortunately she wasn't hurt too badly.</p><p>
        We headed south out of the park to<a href="http://www.broadwaymarket.co.uk/">Broadway Market</a>which seemed to stand in complete contrast to the area. It was a quaint, trendy street market populated with hooray Henry’s, selling scrummy foods and goods. There were a variety of lovely cooking smells wafting around. We dreamed of having some money to actually buy some bits, but we passed and moved on over the Regent's canal down to Haggerston Park where Katie and Ben had a run around the bmx track. There was a child no older than two that was on a 'running bike', like Joey's, who managed to go down the hills at great pace with no help. He balanced himself. I thought it was a neat bike to promote balance. Better than stabilizers.
      </p><p><a href="www.hackneycityfarm.co.uk/">Hackney City Farm</a>was next door where we saw Farfar wallowing around in the mud! Ben was scared of the chickens that were free to roam around in the courtyard! Are you a man or a mouse? It turns out that one of the pigs was actually named Katie!
      </p><p>We headed east to the huge Victoria park to play on the swings, then had an ice cream, then blagged a free bus ride to Dalston. We got off two stops too late and had to walk back to the station! We eventually made it home in the rain.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_03_15-DalstonMontage.jpg</src><caption>Dalston, Hackney, Beth Green</caption></image>

We turned to an Osteopath who subtly prodded her over her body. We'll see over the next few days if it has worked. Daddy is not holding out much hope. Researching, it would appear that there is not a great deal of medical facts that backs up the practice.
      </p><p><b>Mummy accused of shoplifting in Tesco's</b><br />Mummy took Daddy's Valentines trousers back to Tesco as they had forgot to remove the security tag. As Mummy didn't have a receipt when she went to the customer service desk the lady was quite abrupt and called the manager. After some heated exchanges Mummy left the shop. Tesco later rung up and apologised!

    <title>Fars Easter Lunch</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was a bitterly cold day. Daddy and Ben went off on a bike ride looking for the motorbike top box. Needless to say they didn't find it.</p><p>For lunch we went over to the Fars and had some lovely lamb. Katie dressed as an Indian for the day, including a spot on the forehead! Auntie Susan had brought round Katie's bridesmaid dress to try on. She was so happy and looked beautiful.</p><p>We later went for a walk to the ponds on the trolley.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_03_21-08-EasterFars.jpg</src><caption>Farfar Trollied</caption></image>

    <title>Clandon Park</title>

		<p>
        We braved the conditions and went to
        <a href="http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/main/w-vh/w-visits/w-findaplace/w-clandonpark/">
          Clandon Park
        </a>
        which is a National Trust stately home. We were not there to learn about the history of the place or marvel at the art and furniture. No we were there for an Easter egg hunt, which we enjoyed. Ben and Katie only got told a few times to not swing on the ropes or touch various bits and pieces. You just are slightly distracted when you can see Ben in the corner of your eye swinging around with the curtains, whilst a guide is trying to explain the history behind a spoon or something! Daddy could bare it no more. Ben going around in his muddy boots on carpets that look in better condition than our new one!
      </p><p>Upstairs there was a face painting event. Ben was a monster and Katie a butterfly. They loved it. As the rain and sleet was coming across horizontally the gardens were closed and we had to eat our picnic in the car.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_03_22-04-ClandonPark.jpg</src><caption>Scary looking lot</caption></image>

		<p>We began the day by decorating our boiled eggs. Didn't mean we ate them. In fact Daddy had four!</p><p>The Elders hosted a Barnett Easter party. First up was a lovely roast cooked by Michael's fair hands. Parsnips were top dollar. Later, the rest of the Barnett clan came over to join the mayhem. A huge egg hunt was setup out back. Overall we made a killing on the number of Easter Eggs. Daddy doesn't know whether to laugh or cry!</p><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/c6bl5LtcPp8&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/c6bl5LtcPp8&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object><p>Katie went off with the Weston’s and Uncle Peter to stay in Istead Rise for the night.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_03_24-01-EasterMonday.jpg</src><caption>Egg Decorating</caption></image>

    <title>Stay over at Ma Ma's</title>
    <info>
		<p>I had a lovely stay with Ma Ma, Pop Pop and Uncle Peter. Yesterday, when I first got to Ma Ma and Pop Pop's house I watched a little bit of television and played games with Ma Ma - it was great. Sadly it was time for bed, so I snuggled up with Ma Ma and read a book. I showed Uncle Peter how I could read my own book and some flash cards. He was most impressed.</p><p>In the morning I awoke bright and early and dragged Ma Ma out of bed to play some more games. She, of course, was more than willing and we had a nice time before Pop Pop and Uncle Peter emerged from their beds. The day was absolutely beautiful and so we headed off for an Easter Bunny Hunt near the Duck Pond in Southfleet. We collected all the answers to the quiz and I won a little fluffy duck. Uncle Peter kept making funny comments.</p><p>The day started to get a bit colder so when we arrived in Greenwich we decided to have a meal inside. We went to the Cafe Rouge and I had Cheese on Toast (croque monsieur) and a drink. After this delicious meal we set off for the funfair. It was such fun! I went on quite a few rides and then watched Pop Pop and Uncle Peter go on a really scary one (you wouldn't get me on it in a million years!) Following on from this we headed for the donkeys. I chose a lovely little grey one named Bimbo to ride and he was so sweet. I know Ma Ma wants me to take up riding and I think I will after this great ride. She even says she'll pay for me so come on Mummy book me in!</p><p>Anyway after that we went to a shopping area where Uncle Peter and Pop Pop went to look at printers while Ma Ma and I sat in the car and chatted.</p><p>At last it was time to meet Mummy at the Star. I was so glad to see her. I loved being with my Ma Ma and Pop Pop and Uncle Peter but I did miss my darling Mummy and Daddy and Ben and Jess so much! I am looking forward to the next time.</p><p>Katie Gay</p>

		<p>There was an Easter trail where we had to work out the clues to make a word up. We played on the playground and had an ice cream. We then walked along the woods next to the canal, playing hide and seek and climbing some trees. We surprisingly ended up at Frimley Lodge Park. We played again on the swings and looped around the miniature railway back to the canal centre.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_03_31-01a-Jessica.jpg</src><caption>Jessica Lukeys</caption></image>

    <title>Longleat</title>
    <info>
		<p>We headed west on this cold day to Longleat Safari Park. Ben tried to go with 'big boy' pants', so we had a couple of potty stops. We arrived and handed our Tesco vouchers which saved us the £60 admission fee.</p><p>The highlight of the safari park were the naughty monkeys which ran all over our car to the delight of all of us. They managed open our petrol cap, but fortunately there was no lasting damage, unlike other cars which had aerials and windscreen wipers ripped off.</p><p>We passed the tigers and lions. A lion happened to walk across our path and we heard a few mini-roars which was pretty cool. We finished and went and had our unhealthy picnic outside the house.</p><p>The rain started so we rushed to the train and toured around after which we had a go on the boat where we saw plenty of sea lions, another favourite, a silverback gorilla and the two huge hippos were rarely out of the water. They were very long and huge.</p><p>We finally stopped off in the adventure castle which we could have spent all day in. Daddy is thinking of starting a business locally which replicate's the adventure castle and charge a fiver for a day pass!!!</p><p>We returned home to have fish and chips with Ma Ma and Pop Pop.</p>

    <title>April (Snow) Showers</title>
    <info>
		<p>We woke early to a picture of snow outside. In the space of about an hour there was enough to go sledging. The alarm bells rang and we quickly got ready to go out. We met with the Fars at Frimley Green Rec where there were already a handful of people.</p><p>It was bitterly cold with the wind. Daddy opened the car door to get Jessica out, and it was really difficult to get her out. She was in a nice warm car, asleep. When the door opened the blizzard conditions attacked her and she winced and began to wake. Daddy quickly shut the door again!</p><p>I think we should have left Ben behind as well. He cried and cried. He really is not one for the cold. He hated it. Conversely, Katie loved it. She went down with Mummy, Farmor and raced Daddy down. As time passed the hill became more and more busy and we could no longer put up with Ben's crying, so we ended this year's sledging.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_04_06-04-Sledging.jpg</src><caption>Sledging down Frimley Green Rec</caption></image><p>Later, we went out again and built snowmen. Katie wanted to build her own, so we had two. We had the carrots, hat, scarf the works. Ben was the foreman figure. Just watching. Just grumpy. Did I say he doesn't like the cold?</p>

		<p>Drove to the hop farm to meet Auntie Karen, Summer and Alice. There was a circus big top  and we went in there first where the children did some dancing, then we had a go on some little rides and Katie went on a driving track. She drove a little car and there was roundabouts and traffic light and junctions. She was much better than some of the older children and she loved it. Ben was too small unfortunately. We had a lovely picnic and then went on the swings. Ben was so  brave, going down the hugest tube slide, Mummy could not believe he went down it and then so not to be outdone Katie went on it too. There was some bouncing cushions to jump on a bit light a bouncy castle with no roof and finally we did some painting in the craft tent.</p><p>As we were leaving we saw a magic show advertised in the big top so we stopped to watch. the magician put a sword through the neck of a volunteer. Ben and Katie were fascinated Mummy had to stress that they should not try this on each other at home with the kitchen knives!</p>

		<p>After church we went over to Auntie Susan's for a cup of tea and to put them off having children! We hurried over to the swimming baths in Wokingham for a splash around. Katie and Ben loved it as they were able to go down the slide to their hearts content. They were then thrown across the water, superman style, off for another turn. Jessica loved it as well, especially when she was placed flat on her back on a float and stared at the ceiling! She almost went into a fit of enjoyment. Strange girl.</p>

    <title>Horse Guard's Parade, Fortnum and Mason With Mama</title>
    <info>
		<p>We drove to Farnborough and had to madly run to the station to catch our train to London. Katie is ten times fitter than Mummy. Mummy was really out of breath and Katie was fine when we got there. A nice lady helped Mummy across the bridge with the double buggy and we got on the busiest train and had to stand all the way. We ate our big bag of sweets (Katie’s highlight). We met Ma Ma under the clock at Waterloo and after another mad rush got to horse guards parade just in time to watch the change of the horse guards. The kids enjoyed this. We then walked up Pall Mall  to Buckingham Palace and saw the change of the guards there as well. It was really interesting with bands playing and the police stopping all the traffic.</p><p>We had a nice picnic in St James' park and a go in the park. We walked trough green park to Fortnum and Mason where we wanted to watch the clock. Supposedly two men come out of the clock and shake hands and there is some music on the hour every hour. It was two o'clock and we were waiting with our camera with other tourists but nothing happened much to our disappointment. We went in to the shop and there was a huge old fashioned sweet section, Katie wanted some boiled sweets and Mummy said "no  you might choke2 but Katie kept going on and on so Mummy relented and said "only if you sit in the pushchair and eat them".</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_04_15-15-HorseGuards.jpg</src><caption>Jessica enjoying the sandpit in St. James' Park</caption></image><p>We stopped to feed Jess next and Katie and Ben were playing on the steps. Mummy kept telling Katie to sit still as she had a sweet in her mouth the next thing Katie was choking. Mummy just panicked and was screaming frantically banging Katie on the back and then suddenly the sweet flew out of her mouth. Mummy could not stop trembling, clinging on to Katie like a mad thing. Never again is Katie going to have a boiled sweet!!!!! We then went to the rainforest cafe. Ben and Katie had a big drink sitting on the animal bar stalls, fascinated by all the moving animals. Mummy then tried to feed Jess again while Ma Ma took Katie and Ben into the Trocodero, but Ma Ma got lost in there and couldn't find Mummy for ages. We all got the train home thoroughly exhausted!</p><woops rating="5" woopstitle="Jessica throws up over commuter in train"><p>On the way out of the packed commuter train, Mummy was holding Jessie around the tummy with one hand and Ben with the other. Jessie, then to Mummy's horror, was sick on this man's leg, all over his suit! He looked disgusted. Mummy had to apologise over and over and didn't know what to say - she didn't even have a tissue to offer and couldn't just run because there was a queue to get off the train!</p></woops><p>Ma Ma bathed the kids but Ben later told Mummy that Ma Ma does not put enough water in and That Mummy's baths are better!</p>

    <info>
		<p>We went to the Look Out for another playschool outing. Really good fun building camps but freezing cold. Auntie Ellie, Joey and Lily came over in the afternoon. They all went upstairs to play and came down later all naked and covered in felt pen - they had been drawing on each other.</p>

    <title>Joey Over To Stay</title>
    <info>
		<p>Another miserable weather day which restricted our options. It would seem we can't get Katie a size 9 school shoe in Camberley, Farnborough, Crowthorne or now Fleet! Even Mr Ball hasn't come up with the goods! Anyway, Katie went to a school friend, Joseph's birthday party at Tomlinscote school. She loved the ropes and crash mats. Meanwhile the boys went swimming. Ben learnt to jump in from a standing up position, but sank like a stone when the armbands came off. Some work required there.</p><p>We all returned home to meet with Joey who was going to stay the night. The children were really looking forward for him to stay. It was a bit manic having 3 hyper-actives plus a Jessica. We settled down before bedtime watching Superman.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_04_20-04a-JoeyOverToStay.jpg</src><caption>Joey, Katie and Ben</caption></image>

		<p>We all played with Joey. We dressed him up in a pink ballerina outfit, upon his request.... we then went outside where Joey wanted to go on Katie's pink bike, wearing Katie's pink helmet! We are getting a little worried about the boy. Still saying that Ben was not much better.</p><p>In the afternoon Daddy BBQ'ed and roasted a leg of pork and we all went for a walk around the army estate stopping of at a couple of swing parks.</p>

    <title>Farmor's 60th Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>On this splendid morning we went around to Farmor's to begin her birthday celebrations. Mummy went to listen to Ma ma's talk to the WI about her trip to India.</p><p>Susan came around with breakfast from the bakers which was scrummy, after which we all rushed off to Runnymede to catch a pleasure boat down the Thames. Silly Daddy got the time wrong which gave us an opportunity to go on the merry go-round and motorbike ride. We scooted across the park to finally catch the boat. We had to shout to make it stop... and it did and turned around for us.</p><p>After playing musical chairs for a while we sat outside at the top and looked at all the other cruisers and lovely house as we motored in the Windsor direction. We stopped half way and began to open presents. We had made Farmor a 'Life Book', bird feeder (from Crafty Club) and Ben very kindly thought to give one of his trucks....which he also wrapped. I'm sure Farmor will treasure that. Other presents included a new bike and a bird table.</p><p>We enjoyed going up and down the river. Something to do again. After 45 minutes we disembarked back at the pleasure ground ready for our picnic that Daddy had prepared.</p><p>It was such a sunny, warm day it was lovely to be beside the river watching the boats go past eating our rolls. The Fars and Susan had to depart which left us five to go the bouncy castle and swing park, plus a little stroll up and down the river.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_04_26-01a-FarmorBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Farmor 60th Birthday</caption></image><p>We returned home and soon after Ma Ma, Charlotte and Pop Pop popped around to play and have a cup of tea. In the evening there was a meal for Farmor at the new-ish Italian in Frimley. We returned back to the Fars for birthday cake made by Susan, and coffee. Farmor had a lovely, special day.</p>

    <title>Surrey Heath Show</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Daddy and Ben went on a long, long bike ride around the local area. They returned home with Doughnuts! Mmm.</p><p>The Surrey Heath show was been held at Frimley Lodge Park. We met up with the Fars and went on some fair rides, got our faces painted with camouflage from the army, stroked some pigs, groomed some donkey's, sat in a racing car, had some ice cream, went on the inflatable’s before settling down and watching some events in the main display area. There was a range of shows from some keep fit thing, not sure why we should be interested in that, to a dog show which Katie was particularly fond of.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_05_03-03-SurreyHeathShow.jpg</src><caption>In The Army Now</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_05_03-10-SurreyHeathShow.jpg</src><caption>The piggy’s</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_05_03-32-SurreyHeathShow.jpg</src><caption>Surrey Heath Show</caption></image><p>We finally went to the steam railway and had our first go around, much to the delight of all the boys! I think the best bit of the day was going down the large inflatable slide.</p>

    <title>Horse Show - Stock Car Racing</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        Today we attended two events on opposite sides of the society spectrum, both within a mile of each other. First we went to the 'la de da'
        <a href="http://www.aldershotshow.com/">
          Aldershot Horse Show
        </a>
        at Tweseldown race course. We settled down at the main Arena to watch some show jumping. The fences were pretty high and we were initially unaware it was at international standard! Katie and Ben were interested up to a point, but were easily distracted by things, like going to the toilet multiple times! Ben is currently back in his 'big boy pants' with more success than previously. Out of the six widdles, four were successful and two times he forgot! Still it is progress and at least worth pursuing.
      </p><p>
        We sat and ate our picnic, then went over to see the animal rescue team which had some serious, but funny photo's of animals being stuck. There was also a
        <a href="http://www.thesheepshow.co.uk/">
          sheep show
        </a>
        which was really funny for both the children and adults. The kiwi man sheared a sheep first, then managed to get some of the sheep to dance. He was very amusing. Next door in complete contrast, was a disorganised family who ran the ferret racing. The man on the microphone went off on tangents and really no one was listening to him. Anyway, I'm glad to say that all three children were brave enough to stroke the animal before they raced, which is more than can be said for their mother! The race itself was very funny, with the ferrets going one way then another. Ben is a very, very poor loser. His ferret did not win and he got in an almighty strop because of this.
      </p><p>Next stop was the army, inflatable assault course which Katie won easily, twice! There was a staged horse chasing show, then the sheep man was back again, this time with a sheep race which again was funny. Overall a very nice event. Not too packed, not too expensive. Just right. We saw one of Daddy's old football chums and we also managed to bump into the West family who were enjoying an ice cream.</p><p>
        We moved a mile down the road to see if we could catch the last of the banger racing. After 16 years,
        <a href="http://www.spedeworth.co.uk/raceways/aldershot.html">
          Spedeworth
        </a>
        have opened a track in Aldershot again, much to Daddy's delight. Anyway we sneaked in to watch the final three races, hoping that we may be able to go more regularly as a family. The bangers were a bit thin on the ground, but there were plenty of stock cars. We saw a few crashes and the smell of oil and rubber and the sound of metal scraping on tarmac were all reminiscent of days gone past. Anyway Ben seemed to enjoy it, but Katie was more interested in playing in the dust. The family looked a right mess, with chocolate ice cream around their chops and half their picnic down their clothes. This was about par for the course in the surroundings. We'll do it again one day.

    <title>Hollycombe Steam</title>
    <info>
		<ul><li><i>Katie</i>(Comes home from school) Today, I've learnt how to pole dance!... Really she meant may-pole dance
        </li><li><i>Ben</i>Jessica is 'wide asleep'... derived from 'wide awake' I guess.
        </li></ul><p>
        Continuing with the good weather we went to<a href="http://www.hollycombe.co.uk/">Hollycombe Steam Collection</a>. It's a place with some old fashioned steam driven fair rides and of course steam engines in all shapes and sizes. However, their favourite attraction was the walk-through haunted errr. room. A very simple thing. A big room painted black, no lights, a maze of corridors and feel your way in the dark.
      </p><p>The swing boats. Ben got in a really bad mood because he couldn't work out how to swing the boat. He didn't know when to pull the rope and when to leave it alone. Of course mummy and daddy told him how, but he still couldn't grasp it initially. After a third attempt of explaining he got it and Katie and Ben merrily sailed up and down, up and down.</p><p>We went on the steam train and steam engine ride. We went to the 'magic lantern show' which was really old fashioned. Some old slides were shown accompanied with a poem and a song. Needless to say we embarrassingly had to walk out as the kiddies got restless. We ended on some more rides. A thoroughly enjoyable day out.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_05_05-00-Hollycombe.jpg</src><caption>Hollycombe 2008</caption></image>

    <title>Ben Stockwell's  5th Birthday, Church Fete, Jacquets, Michael's 30th Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>On a gloriously hot, sunny day we played in the garden and collected bugs in the bug box as well as making trains out of Lego. We went over to Jakes soft play for Ben Stockwell's birthday. Later, the Elders popped in to borrow our bike and play for a bit.</p><p>In the afternoon we went down to St. Andrews for the church fete. The usual games were there which the children enjoyed. There was also some face painting. Katie chose a butterfly with glitter. Our boy, our son had the choice of Spiderman, an army man, a pirate. What does he chose? A butterfly with glitter! Please. Obviously we need to toughen him up a bit! Not only that later, he managed to produce a puddle whilst we were watching Katie having a go on the skittles! Saying that, Ben is doing very well generally with his toilet training. Great grandma and granddad were also there enjoying the sunshine and a scone. Daddy spoke to the vicar for quite a while.... not about religion as such, well it's Daddy's religion. We spoke about Aston Villa and Brighton football clubs!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_05_10-20a-ChurchFete.jpg</src><caption>Two little butterflies</caption></image><p>We scooted from the fair over to the Jacquet household in Camberley. Katie and Ben played in the paddling pool and trampoline, whilst the grown-ups sat in the sun and relaxed.</p><p>The Fars came over to babysit whilst Mummy and Daddy went to Hardy's in Bagshot to celebrate Michael's 30th birthday. He got very drunk and went out clubbing for the night.</p><p>Jessica has been pretty bad at sleeping over the past few weeks. She is getting worse rather than better. She seems to wake at 8 or 9pm, then at 11pm, and then on and off until 5am, at which time she is ready to play.</p>

        We shuffled around our weekend plans due to the weather forecast and trundled south towards Bournemouth and went to
        <a href="http://www.adventurewonderland.co.uk">
          Adventure Wonderland
        </a>
        . All the children could go on most of the rides which was really nice. It was pitched just at the right level for Katie's age. There were lots of rides and playground activities. I think the favourite was the inflatable crocodile. Mummy and Daddy were assured it wasn't a real one.
      </p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_05_24-37-AdventureWonderland.jpg</src><caption>Adventure Wonderland</caption></image><p>We headed back towards the Elders where we dropped off Katie and Ben to stay overnight. Katie, Ben, Joey and Lily were very pleased with this arrangement.</p>

    <title>Bowling, Overnight Hotel Stay</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went over to Alton to pick up the children from the Elders. We went for a long walk to the other side of Alton, via the steam railway, which everyone found exhausting.</p><p>Along with the Elders we scooted over to Basingstoke and had a go at ten pin bowling. Ellie was by far the best, and Michael the worst. The Gay's beat the Elders. The children loved getting them all down. They were so proud!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_05_25-02a-Bowling.jpg</src><caption>Ten Pin Bowling</caption></image><p>We said our farewells and we trundled next door to a steam fair which, by luck was still going strong. Ben and Daddy of course loved all the traction engines. There is something about the smell of steam which is magical.</p><p>We didn't stay too long as we had a hotel booked for the night in Amesbury, near Stonehenge. We got there in good time. It was Daddy, Ben and Katie's job to find our now traditional Fish and Chips. It was a Sunday evening and it wasn't going to be easy. We headed south to Salisbury city centre, and after asking 3 different people and walking around in circles we finally managed to get our treat, plus a bonus lollipop from the fish and chip man just to make sure we were really unhealthy. Surprisingly Katie and Ben didn't gobble it down there and then, and decided to save the lollipop for tomorrow! Very sensible.</p><p>We had the usual fun and games during the night with Jessica. We awoke on the Bank Holiday Monday to a torrent of rain. We decided not to travel to Gloucester to see the cheese rolling, instead we made it home by 8:30am.</p>

    <title>Clay Pigeon Shooting, Camping With Charlotte</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy went off with Farfar for Uncle Graham's Stag clay pigeon shooting. Of course they turned up late. Daddy started off with 9 out of 10.... then proceeded with 3 out of 30. Farfar, was marginally better. Graham's team won, although most people had huge red marks over their shoulders. It was quite interesting to hear about it all. At 30 yards the shot spreads over a 30 inch diameter.</p><p>Meanwhile the rest of us played with Natasha at the swing park, then Auntie Charlotte turned up to take Katie camping at the Basingstoke Canal Centre. She had a late night, but a very enjoyable one.</p><p>Ben's current craze is Star Wars, or as he says it Star Warez. He is Luke Skywalker and knows the main characters and main storyline. He unfortunately has a 'light saver'!.. or picks up sticks as a substitute and waves it about, without much care for what's around.</p><p>Jessica is getting a lot better at night time. Not so much of the pain ridden screaming at night.... Just waking for feeds and attention. She is yet to start crawling, so she is behind Katie and Ben after 8 months.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_05_31-12-ClayPigeonShooting.jpg</src><caption>At the shoot</caption></image>

    <title>Ellie and Charlotte - Race For Life</title>
    <info>
		<p>We were awoken at 6am with a knock on the door from Charlotte and Katie! They returned early after not having much sleep. We left for Southsea at 9:30 to find a good spot to see all the runners go past and hopefully see our crew. Anyway after a bit of a rush we saw the leaders go past and kept our eyes peeled. The field went down to the walkers and we were sure we had missed Ellie and Char. So Mummy decided to move on to a place without telling Daddy. Anyway we were all separated, phoneless and lost.</p><p>Mummy did manage to see the girls close to the finish line which was nice. They made it around the 5kn course in about 40 minutes. Eventually Daddy found us and we met up with the Sanders and Elders to have a picnic just behind the beach. We later, then went onto the stony beach where we paddled in the ice cold sea. Well Daddy and Katie did. Ben was not getting out of his big, think boots and shorts. Anyway Joey bravely bared all and went into the sea!</p><p>On our return home we stopped off at the campsite, cleared up the tent from the night before and had a go on the swings. An early night.</p>

    <info>
		<p>We set off at 08;15 to Auntie Helen's house. We had a cup of tea in the mansion and Katie and Ben ate her whole stock of biscuits and made do with the cats toys as a way of amusement.</p><p>We left there and drove to Medway country park to meet Ma Ma and Pop Pop. We had a walk round and then a nice picnic made by Pop Pop. We then went on to the Marina for a sail on Babar. We sailed past Chatham and Upnor Castle and saw an old submarine. Katie and Ben enjoyed it, playing houses in the cabins.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_06_07-10-Babar.jpg</src><caption>Check Me Out</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_06_07-26-Babar.jpg</src><caption>On Babar</caption></image><p>In the evening Pop Pop and Daddy went clothes shopping to Bluewater (what girls!).

    <info>
		<p>The girls and Ben went to church while the boys stayed at home to build the trampoline and see saw Ma Ma had bought. On the way home the girls popped in to see Auntie Anna and Uncle Peter and fed their fish. Katie and Ben were desperate to get back and play on the new things. Daddy and Pop Pop had done a fine job putting them together. Katie and Ben then played in the lovely sun.</p><p>Ma Ma had also bought some water pistols. Mummy had the idea to call Daddy into the garden and Pop Pop was supposed to lock the door and we were going to soak him. However, Pop Pop missed his cue to lock the door and we squirted daddy but he did not find it funny, then we got Ben who also did not find it funny. Like father like son. Katie, mummy and Ma Ma enjoyed themselves though.</p><p>Pop Pop cooked a £22 leg of lamb which Daddy and pop Pop loved. In the afternoon we all went to see Teaky, Ma Ma's horse. Katie groomed it and sat on her. We then drove home very tired.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_06_08-21-SundayAtCarolGerry.jpg</src><caption>Montage</caption></image>

    <title>Daddy Goes To School</title>
    <info>
		<p>As part of the impending Father's Day, all Daddy's were allowed to go to school with their children and sit in the lessons for as long as they wanted. So Daddy nervously wanted to go. You never know he might learn something. Daddy was going to see what actually goes on. When he asks Katie what she does, we always get an unenthusiastic response.</p><p>Daddy was the only father to turn up for the first part of day (9am). We played until the register was called. It was a bit embarrassing for Daddy as he seemed centre of attention, with children wanting to sit next to him and even cuddle him! There was a lot of things to get the children involved. Questions about today's weather, today's date, what we are currently learning, etc. I noticed that most pupils were eager to put their hands up to answer, however, Katie was a little tentative. When she reluctantly put her hand up for the 'day of the week' question, she answered correctly, Friday, however, when asked how she knew that she replied that it was a guess. Well at least she is honest.</p><p>One thing I could say very positively is that Katie was very attentive, sat still and focused on Miss King and what she said. Others had to be told subtlety to buck their ideas up.</p><p>The current topic was farm animals, in particular knowing an adult and child name of a species. We were all given a small card, with a picture and word of an animal. We then had to go around the class and ask for its older or younger counterpart. This was quite fun and we played this twice. Miss King then took a group of 4 or 5 and took them through some book work. The 15 others, could play in the classroom or just outside where there were many activities, from painting, playing the water pit, Lego, musical instruments, farms and computer work. I think in the half an hour we managed to get round all of these, including playing vets in the Wendy house. Some of Katie's friends followed Daddy around and try to steal him from Katie! I think it was daddy being silly and making pig noises won them over!</p><p>At 10:15 it was the school assembly. Each class took a line in the main hall and sat down. Mrs Allen, the headmistress, appears to know the names of all the pupils which is quite remarkable really, as she politely told some pupils to behave themselves. Anyway, after the healthy eating topic, she moved onto the Headmistress Awards. Two pupils from each class, each week get picked out for something good they have done. They pulled to the front of the assembly and asked about their work. Well today, it so happens that Katie was picked for her exceptionally improvement in her writing. She has been behind and something of a concern, but recently she has been able to form her letters a lot better now. It was nice to see some recognition for this. Anyway Daddy was very proud and Katie was beaming also. Well done Katie.</p><p>Before daddy had to rush back to work, him and Katie were picked out with a couple of others to have their photo taken for the Camberley News and Mail newspaper (in the end we made the front page!! See account on 24th June 2008). Not sure if they'll make it, but it was good to be picked. Must be because of the looks!</p><p>A really enjoyable time for Daddy. An insight in what goes on between 9am and 3pm.  From the little he saw, there is quite a lot of play and Katie needs her confidence building up when answering questions.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_06_13-05-MartinToSchoolKatie.jpg</src><caption>School Pals</caption></image>

    <title>Bekonscot</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        We went with the Fars over to<a href="http://www.bekonscot.com/">Bekonscot</a>, the oldest model village in the world. We started with a train ride then a look around the model city, rather than village. All set in the 1920's. Katie and Ben loved looking at all the little shops, people and model train set which ran all the way around the place.
      </p><p>
        After picnicking and an extended play at the swings we finished off the village and headed towards the
        <a href="http://www.theoldshirehorsecentre.com/">
          Old Shire Centre
        </a>
        near Maidenhead. We went for the shire horses, but on arrival we were told that there have not been shire horses there for 12 years! We were told it was the 'Old' Shire Centre, as in there used to be shire horses. Still a bit of a con. Nevertheless we saw Farfar in one of the pig pens again, and had our second tranche of swings! If there was a choice between the farm animals or swings, they would choose swings every time at the moment.

    <title>Father's Day - Iscot</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy was treated to a fried breakfast in bed for Father's day. Ben had made a card with a photo of himself and an outline of his hands for Daddy. Katie was given £1 at school to buy something at the school stalls. She had bought a mini torch to go on my key ring, and Jessica kindly got Daddy (which of course had to be shared with Mummy) a chocolate bar.</p><p>We popped over to the Fars in the morning, whilst Katie and Mummy went to church. The train set made an appearance surprisingly enough.</p><p>From there, all of us went over to Istead Rise for Iscot, to celebrate Ellie's impending 30th birthday. The Barnett clan arrived along with some of Ellie's friends. Judith came all the way down from Manchester! The afternoon had an Ascot theme with betting on horse races shown on DVD. Pop Pop also done a BBQ.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_06_15-11-FarsIscot.jpg</src><caption>Iscot</caption></image>

    <title>Katie on two wheels</title>
    <first name="katie">Katie - No Stabilizers</first>
    <info>
		<p>We had planned to go to Brighton today, however, the weather put pay to that idea. Instead Ben decided to get in touch with his feminine side (again!) and demanded to be called Alyssa and dressed up in a pink dress! Of course we again had to watch Star Wars, we have now moved to Empire Strikes Back!</p><p>In the afternoon we went to the Pool In The Park, Richmond. It had a proper indoor and outdoor pool as well as a nice warm baby pool, which we initially went in. Ben continued to be a 'girl' when it came to the outdoor pool, complaining it was too cold! Katie on the other hand loved it and wanted to stay in there. Her swimming is really coming on. I think she actually managed to swim 10 meters without touching the bottom. It wasn't fluid mind you, but at least she is improving.</p><p>I think we were there for two hours. All but the driver slept on the way home. Just before dinner, Daddy tried Katie once more on the bike without the stabilizers. We had tried earlier in the year, but it really was hopeless. This time however, Katie managed to balance right away.  She just struggled a bit on the start, but she was so happy that she could join the rest of her friends in the 'I've got no stabilizers' group. Well done Katie.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_06_21-00-KatieNoStablelizers.jpg</src><caption>Girlie Ben and Cycling Katie</caption></image>

    <title>Mummy's 32nd Birthday and Sports Day</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy has reached the grand old age of 32. We started the day by opening presents and cards in bed. Daddy gave mummy a pink and white pair of Nike's, two pink and white tops and some pink and white socks along with a CD player for the kitchen. Mummy also got £55 of Next vouchers, some pyjamas, some smellies and lots of chocolates.</p><p>We went along with Daddy down to the Spar. We each had some money to buy mummy some sweeties. Well only the wine gums made it home to Mummy, the other sweet were eaten en-route home!</p><p>It was Katie's Sports Day in the morning and Daddy managed to get a half day's holiday to come and watch. The school was split into teams comprising of a dozen children from each year of the school. Each team performed an event for two minutes, then moved onto the next one. Anyway Katie's team won, although I don't think we can say that she is a budding athlete.</p><p>Next were the individual, 40 metre races. Katie came half way. "Did you see I takeover somebody?". She was proud of this fact. Mummy came last in the .... erm Mummies race which involved balancing a bean bag on her head. Daddy came third in the .... erm Daddies race.</p><p>Auntie Ellie, Joey and Lily later came around, then sandwiched between picking Katie up from school and swimming, we visited the Fars who gave mummy a tent.</p><p>We had a curry and watched a DVD in the evening, which we slept half way through!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_06_25-00-KatieSportsDay.jpg</src><caption>Sports Day and Birthday</caption></image>

		<p>Katie went off to Ma Ma's with Joey for the day. The rest of us met up with the Sanders and went to visit Rebecca at her home near Liss. You could see Rebecca really wanted to stay awake, but she was very sleepy. We continued anyway and took her for a walk around the grounds and had a scrummy picnic.</p><p>Fortunately we had a shared picnic, which means we get to eat all the nice food that the Sanders had bought. Daddy was in his element. We said out goodbyes and moved on to a really good swing park in Petersfield next to a lake and had an ice cream!</p><p>Later in the afternoon we went over to the Elders who were hosting a BBQ. Michael ensured that all the meat was thoroughly cooked. Ben decided he could sort himself out when it came to sitting on the toilet. Anyway there was a lot of mess in that bathroom and not all where it was intended to be! Embarrassing. The evening turned into a Wii Fit event. Daddy was on the border of being overweight!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_05-02-KarenRichElderBBQ.jpg</src><caption>Jessica saying hello to Rebecca</caption></image>

    <title>Susan and Graham's Wedding</title>
    <info>
		<p>Finally after nine years of courting and a year plus engagement, Susan and Graham were today to get married in St Peter's, Frimley. Preparations went well, Susan, Farmor and Enid made sure of that. The weather all week has been shockingly wet, so we were surprised to see that we had a sunny day for all the bits that were important.</p><p>Susan, Sophie, Farmor and Farfar prepared at Richmond Close. The hairdresser was snipping hair and all was pretty relaxed. Daddy was getting nervous in preparing for his Corinthians reading. Katie was getting ready and looking beautiful in her bridesmaid outfit. 3pm arrived, we were all settled in church and Susan, who looked fantastic, was led arm in arm by Farfar, who looked very smart and proud, with the bridesmaids trailing behind in their half white, half lavender coloured dresses. Graham was waiting at the altar in his dress, with his brother, the best man, Robin, who only just made it due to commando exercises.</p><p>The ceremony was conducted by Mavis, the lady vicar. Graham was pretty jovial throughout the service. Daddy got through his reading OK. Jessica was a fidget and a chatterbox throughout the service. It was so nice to see so much family around, many seeing Jessica for the first time. Unfortunately we didn't know Graham's family too well.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_12-01a--02-SusanGrahamWedding.jpg</src><caption>Church Exit</caption></image><p>
        After an hour the service ended and we made our way outside for photos and to see Susan and Graham Tremear off in their old gangster car. The parents had a £120k Bentley to take them to the reception at the
        <a href="http://www.mercure.com/mercure/fichehotel/gb/mer/6621/fiche_hotel.shtml">
          Farnham Bush Hotel

        . They wouldn't for some reason let me chauffeur them!
      </p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_12-15a--03-SusanGrahamWedding.jpg</src><caption>With the beautiful bridesmaids</caption></image><p>More photos and Graham revealed that there wasn't too much clothing under his dress! Shocking! We sat down for the Wedding Breakfast which consisted of Tomato and Cheese for starter, Roast Beef for mains and a tart thingy for pudding. Very nice, although Mummy and Daddy took it in turns to take Jessica out for a walk. Then came the speeches...</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_12-09a--04-SusanGrahamWedding.jpg</src><caption>Skipping Bridesmaids</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_12-21--04-SusanGrahamWedding.jpg</src><caption>Foreground - Background</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_12-27a--04-SusanGrahamWedding.jpg</src><caption>Gay side of the family</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_12-40--04-SusanGrahamWedding.jpg</src><caption>Chase me</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_12-44--04-SusanGrahamWedding.jpg</src><caption>The Danish connection</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_12-49--04-SusanGrahamWedding.jpg</src><caption>Reardons laughing at Graham's underwear</caption></image><p>First up for the slaughter was Farfar. Nervous anticipation. He had done very well and even Mummy, the harshest critic said it was a lovely speech. Next up was Graham who also said some lovely, heart-felt things. Finally Robin, who kept it to about 10 minutes and came up with some funny and original content. Overall good speeches. Time was marching on, so the cake cutting and coffee was left to later and the hall was cleared for the first dance and disco.</p><p>Katie and Ben were looking forward to this part all day long. Susan and Graham couldn't have their preferred Pink Floyd song, instead had to go for something slower and less rocky which would be more appropriate for a first dance. As soon as it was time for the disco, Katie and Ben began to flag quickly and very soon it was home time for them. We returned home and left Daddy to carry on at the party.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_12-15--06-SusanGrahamWedding.jpg</src><caption>First dance</caption></image><p>Daddy managed to speak a lot to the Dixons', stepping his foot in it with the impending arrival of David and Lisa Dixon number 2 child. Obviously fun with the Danish clan of Lise, Jørgen, Joan and Gert. Also managed to speak to Graham's parents and Uncles Ross and John. Barrie was 'taking the micky' fodder. He is so tight it is unbelievable.</p><p>It was good to see the Reardons who had only touched down 12 hours previously to come down from the Midlands. Joshua such a nice lad - someone I last maybe have seen as a baby.</p><p>The disco finished about 12:30 with a dozen of the hardened crew, including the bride and groom staying in the hotel bar. A good day had by all.</p>

    <title>Frimley Green Carnival</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy stayed over at the hotel overnight and had breakfast with some of the wedding guests. Meanwhile the rest of us were preparing for the Frimley Green Carnival. Mummy had done a lot of work in organising the stall and float for the playschool contribution.</p><p>We had help from Ma Ma, Pop Pop, Charlotte and the Sanders. 2pm came and the procession started. Mummy and Daddy were able to hitch a ride on the Nations Of The World themed, playschool float with Ben. Katie was on the Cross Farm float. The crowds were pretty large. We managed to see all the grandparents and great grandparents, the Danes and the West’s on the short route to the Lakeside club.</p><p>Ben enjoyed looking out to the crowds. We think Katie enjoyed it to, although we didn't see her.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_13-46-FrimleyGreenCarnival.jpg</src><caption>View from the playschool float</caption></image><p>Soon after we departed and went separately again. Daddy went over to Auntie Susan’s to see her and Graham open wedding presents. The rest of us went to Grace's birthday party where there was a magic man!</p><p>Come the end of the day we were all pretty tired. One of the busiest weekends we have had ever we think.</p>

    <title>Emma's 5th Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy spent the morning constructing Katie's bike that she is getting for her birthday. Wonder how long it stays up before it falls apart? Emma, Katie's class friend, had a lunchtime birthday at Tomlinscote school.</p><p>Later in the sunny afternoon we popped over to Frimley Green Rec and sat on top of the hill to watch the Farnborough Air Show. There were lots of people that had a similar idea. Daddy and Jessica sat at the top of the hill, unfortunately, most of the planes had flown by. The rest of us played on the swings of course!</p>

    <title>Ballet Exam, Harrison's 1st Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie had a ballet exam this morning. She had to have her hair in a specific style using a 6 inch pink ribbon. All sounds very strict. She done a routine with Natasha. We await to hear the results.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_20-04-Ballet.jpg</src><caption>Nijinsky (not the horse)</caption></image><p>It was Harrison's first birthday and we went around the West's abode for a BBQ and a jump about on the bouncy castle. It was good to see Katie and Ben mix with children they do not know so well. It was good to see James and Emma there as well.</p><p>Later in the evening Karen took Mummy out to see Mama Mia at the cinema. Mummy said it was the best film ever.</p>

    <title>School's Out For Summer!!</title>
    <first name="katie">School Report</first>
    <info>
		<p>Today, was Katie's last day in Miss King's, lambs class. We are very happy with Katie's progress, particularly after a slowish start. Most impressively, Katie in past month has began to start writing sentences of her own accord. She is spelling words phonetically that she has not come across before. She is very happy with school and has made some very good friends.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_06_XX-01-KatieSchoolReport.jpg</src><caption>Katie's School Report</caption></image><p>Ben broke up last week. Difficult to gauge his progress really because he larks around so much. Is there a big brain under that grumpy face? We reckon he picks a lot of stuff up from Katie when we do her homework. Anyway he has a good friend at playschool, Oliver Strangle.</p>

    <title>Katie's 5th Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>I don't think we have seen Katie eagerly anticipate her birthday as much as this year. She was too excited to sleep last night. Finally falling at 9:30pm, then waking at 5:30am this morning!</p><p>Mummy and Daddy could not hold out any longer, and at 6am we began opening some presents. She hauled a nice lot of presents, including some from Denmark which was very kind. Mummy and Daddy had hid Katie's main present in the en-suite. She was very pleased with a new bike!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_24-10-Katie5thBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Katie's new bike</caption></image><p>We snuggled downstairs to watch CBeebies, only to find Katie's birthday card had made a TV appearance for the third year running! We were all very excited. First one to be read out as well.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_24-12-Katie5thBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Katie's card on CBeebies</caption></image><p>Natasha, Nina, Emma and Joey, her four closest friends, were invited for lunch and a little play in the back garden. You can tell they had a good time, as there was plenty of mess to be tidied.</p><p>Later in the afternoon Farmor, Auntie Susan, Great Grandma and Granddad came across to give presents and for a little play as well. At tea time we had a take away pizza which was a real treat for us all.</p>

    <info>
		<p>On this glorious sunny day we went down to the local library fete where there were lots of animals to touch. Where Katie would no way touch anything a couple of years back she was now quite curious and stroked a jumping fire bellied toad, a cockroach, a giant African snail and even a snake! Ben on the other hand Ben was a big scaredy cat.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_26-12b-AliceHoltFruitPick.jpg</src><caption>Benny Bum</caption></image><p>We went out for a picnic in a field in Burnt Oak and then over to a 'pick your own fruit' place, where we got some potatoes, beetroot, rhubarb and lots of raspberries.</p><p>Alice Holt was our final destination of the day. We took Katie's new bike, and her old pink one that Ben had attached himself to. Well, that is the last time we follow Mummy. Not only were the bikes unsuitable for the terrain and skill level, but we also got lost and ended up at Lodge Pond! We finally made it back and slept well.</p>

		<p>Katie had 21 friends for her party at Surrey Borders Gym Club, Camberley. It was hot, hot, hot inside. The first hour was spent running around using the gym apparatus. There was a lot of energy out there.</p><p>It was lunchtime and the usual concoction of e-numbers were served as well as the innovative Barbie birthday Katie made by Great Grandma and decorated by Great Granddad! Mummy then ran a couple of games: What's The Time Mr Wolf, Musical Bumps and Musical Statues. Two hours was long enough as everyone was sweltering in the greenhouse, gym club.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_07_27-23-KatieBirthdayParty.jpg</src><caption>Party, Party, Party</caption></image><p>In the afternoon we had some visitor who watched me open the presents given at the party. I got lots of nice things. Thank you for all those who gave presents and helped out at the party.</p>

    <title>Drayton Manor</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        Today we were treated to go to<a href="http://www.draytonmanor.co.uk">Drayton Manor</a>, a theme park in the Midlands. Primarily chosen because it had a new 'Thomas Land' which excite Ben very much. In fact both Ben and Katie had been looking forward to this trip very much.... and we were not disappointed.
      </p><p>We began in Thomas Land which was pretty busy. We had to swap around quite a lot because Jessie was not allowed on some rides. But we were very impressed on the lack of height restrictions, allowing Ben and Katie to go on most of the rides. After a few rides, we escaped for our picnic and then had a go on the cable cars, which flew over the whole park. This turned out to be all of our favourite ride. So good, we had a second go straight away. There were so many rides which we all went on, including Jessica.</p><p>We attempted to rush between rides to fit them all in before the park closed at 6pm. We ended, fittingly, on a ride from Knapford station on Thomas himself.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_02-00-DraytonManor.jpg</src><caption>Drayton Manor</caption></image><p>We stopped off at a chippy on the 2.5 hour trip home. All had a good day.</p>

    <info>
		<p>We awoke early and sat on the bed opening presents. This year the theme was definitely Thomas The Tank Engine and Star Wars. Ben was very excited with his new bike. He said - I'm so pleased with my bike.</p><p>Well there was terrible weather so the 20+ people who were going to squeeze into the garden had to squeeze into the house which made things interesting. Anyway Ben's friends were very generous with their presents. We played some traditional games and had a birthday picnic lunch in the front room.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_05-26-BenBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Birthday Chaos</caption></image><p>Although a little frenetic, the children enjoyed themselves.

    <title>North Devon Holiday - Minehead</title>
    <info>
		<p>Our first proper family holiday with the five of us, in fact a first holiday in quite some time. We've chosen a holiday park in Bideford Bay. We've not done North Devon so all new territory.</p><p>We meandered our way down through the traffic and weather to Exmoor and stopped off at Minehead. The beach was pretty deserted but we done our best to look for little animal or two in the rock pools. Coldness got the better of Ben after about 30 seconds, especially after he somehow got wet. On our way back to the car we stopped off to see the steam train which arrived at the station.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_09-14-Day1-Minehead.jpg</src><caption>Packed, sunny beach</caption></image><p>We arrived at the park in the pouring rain and entered our cosy chalet (with a real emphasis on the 'let', as Ben pronounces it). A bedroom for Katie and Ben and a travel cot for Jess. Mummy and Daddy stayed up for the Olympics.</p>

    <title>North Devon Holiday - Cliff Walk, Bude</title>
    <info>
		<p>First thing we went for a walk down to Bucks Mills beach which entailed a woodland walk down, down, down.... And what a secret, great place. A 25 foot waterfall crashing down on to the beach and plenty of rock pools. Fantastic. Only Daddy and Katie fancied the return journey up the hill!</p><p>After a 40 mile detour due to someone forgetting the wallet, we made our way to Bude down the coast. A lovely costal town with a large sandy beach and a large amount of wind to go with it. We had to abort the beach picnic as sand was blowing around. We didn't even attempt going near the sea! We made our way to the lighthouse on top of the cliff and out on the blustery causeway.</p><p>Ice Creams were next in line. Ben ordered a big, bright blue ice cream and then decided he didn't want it. Jessy of course was sure to make her voice heard and had a nibble at each of ours.</p><p>We rushed back and went in the on-site outdoor swimming pool (in the rain) and had a go in the indoor version as well. Something that all three children saw as the best bit of their holiday so far!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_10-19-Day2-BucksMillsBude.jpg</src><caption>Bucks Mills Waterfall</caption></image>

    <title>North Devon Holiday - The Big Sheep</title>
    <info>
		<p>Early doors we had a look around Bideford town. Really nice again and a refreshing change from chain store to chain store. Narrow streets on a hill with no modern architecture at all.</p><p>We pushed onto the Big Sheep, a park aimed exactly for the likes of Ben and Katie. There we took part in some duck trailing, saw lambs being fed, watched three day old piglets jump around their mother, went on a tractor ride and train ride. Daddy and Jess enjoyed the Beer talk, whilst Katie and Ben had a great time in the soft play. We were all surprised when Katie and Ben went down the big drop slide. Ben maintains he really loved it, but funnily enough wouldn't go on it again! He wishes he could be brave but just isn't. Saying that he was able to feed the sheep without any bother. Katie didn't even get close. Certainly we filled the day and had a great time.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_11-09-Day3-BigSheep.jpg</src><caption>Feeding the Big Sheep</caption></image>

    <title>North Devon Holiday - Ilfracombe and Woolacombe</title>
    <info>
		<p>We headed north to Ilfracombe and braved the elements on the rocky beach. The beach was surrounded by cliffs, and rocks popped out of the sea which made it a great playground for us. We paddled a bit, until Ben fell into the water and screamed his little heart out. Not because he was hurt, but because he was cold! Whilst Mummy took him back to the car to get changed, Katie pretended to be the little mermaid on the rocks. A convincing performance she gave as well. Showers curtailed our beaching experience so we sheltered and had our picnic. The big climb up the cliff which overlooked the beach was next. A great view of the coastline up there.</p><p>We then explored the rest of the town by car.... what a lovely town it was as well. A real shame that the weather put pay to more exploration, However, Katie and Mummy's managed a little trip to the tiny chapel at the end of the harbour.</p><p>Next stop were the sandy beaches of Woolacombe. We had great fun splashing in the puddles. Mummy and Katie braved it and went in to the sea, but then came running straight out again. Jessica on the other hand was trying to munch her way through the beach. Yes she loved eating sand! Despite the cool climate, we could have stayed there all day.</p><p>Just by chance in the ice cream parlour we sat next to Katie's class mate, Phoebe. Small world.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_12-13-Day4-IlfracombeWoolacombe.jpg</src><caption>Ilfracombe Rapids</caption></image>

    <title>North Devon Holiday - Steam Railway, Swimming</title>
    <info>
		<p>The weather continued to be terrible, so we decided non-outside activities today. We trekked up to see Watermouth Castle but decided that it wasn't much of a castle, but it did have a theme park attached to it. However, weather and prices dictated that this would not be today's best option.</p><p>We headed along the coast to Combe Martin and got out, walked five paces to see the torrent of water streaming towards the sea and the rocky beach when the heavens opened once more. We forced ourselves to carry on, but the children really were voicing their opinions so we had to abort and continue in the car.</p><p>
        We reached the<a href="http://www.lynton-rail.co.uk/visitors/location">Lynton and Barnstable Steam Railway</a>which was a half size train. To be honest this was a bit disappointing for £13. A mile down a hill and a mile back again. All in all about 10 minutes of travel.
      </p><p>Weather still terrible and to cap a bad day, a big puddle appeared in the foot well of the passenger side of the car as well as Mummy having left the pushchair out in the rain all night!</p><p>With limited options we decided to head to Croyde and to a swimming pool which had a 90 minute queue! Anyway we had fun in the pool with Katie and Ben circling around the slide again and again.</p><p>We returned home, Ben singing 'We all live in an Elephant Submarine'. Not sure Mr Lennon had thought of these alternative lyrics. As Ben has had so many trouser 'accidents' we had to do a run to the laundrette.... which resulted in Daddy having an argument with a women who jumped the queue in front of us!</p>

    <title>North Devon Holiday - Clovelly, Westward Ho!</title>
    <info>
		<p>We travelled west for a few miles to the oldie worlde seaside village of Clovelly. We hadn't realized you had to pay to get to see the village properly, however, we found a semi legitimate entrance. We descended down the cobbled street. No cars and someone was moving house. People use sledges to transport stuff down to their shops and houses which was funny to see.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_14-10-Day6-ClovellyWestwardHo.jpg</src><caption>It girl</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_14-20-Day6-ClovellyWestwardHo.jpg</src><caption>Clovelly</caption></image><p>We made our way down to the harbour when it began to rain again, which meant we didn't see the waterfall. A really lovely place to visit.</p><p>We skipped eastwards to Westward Ho! A place with an exclamation mark in it. A big, deep sandy beach, with rock pools. And we went searching for crabs. With the help of some boys we founds loads of crabs which were put into a bucket. Ben was even brave enough to hold one! We all really enjoyed the hunt, overturning big rocks to see them hiding and boasting on finding the biggest crabs.</p><p>Then all of the sudden a big wash of water came over the rocks and the tide had come in so quickly it caught us all out. In fact our shoes were floating on the water and the rucksack with the camera in it began to sink below the water. Fortunately with the help of others we retrieved all our belongings.</p><p>We retreated to play in the sand, then off for an ice cream, then back to the park for a swim.</p>

    <title>North Devon Holiday - Tintagel</title>
    <info>
		<p>We awoke not really knowing what we were to do today. As is often the case it made for the best day of the hols we think. Daddy wanted to see Boscastle, which was very disappointing. We didn't even stop.</p><p>
        We then headed towards Tintagel, but on the way we saw a shabby sign for a waterfall,
        <a href="http://www.tintagelweb.co.uk/St%20Nectan's%20Glen.htm">
          St Nectan's Glen
        </a>
        . We started on the woodland walk, but 30 minutes in the children were whinging and whining so we turned back to the car without seeing the waterfall itself!
      </p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_15-11-Day7-Tintagel.jpg</src><caption>Daddy and Jess</caption></image><p>Tintagel came to the rescue, the village was great. The cove even better. Another waterfall and cave in which a dragon lived according to Katie and Ben! We enjoyed ourselves down their... and then we had the steep climb back to the village with a pushchair full with Ben and Jess. You've got to try it.</p><p>After another ice cream we returned home via Widemouth Bay for another early evening swim.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_15-29-Day7-Tintagel.jpg</src><caption>Katie Boof(tiful) Gay</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_15-22-Day7-Tintagel.jpg</src><caption>Tintagel Waterfall</caption></image>

    <title>North Devon Holiday - Lynton and Lynmouth</title>
    <info>
		<p>Home day. We packed up and dropped the key off. We went to Lynton and Lynmouth. Towns which almost merge into one. Again very idyllic villages with great views into the sea.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_16-18-Day8-LyntonLynmouth.jpg</src><caption>Yummy Mummy</caption></image><p>The children behaved very well seeing that we were stuck in the car for 7 hours or so. At one point Ben very worryingly said - I've seem a yummy boy in a scrummy car! - What!</p><p>Overall it was nice to have time with the five of us. Some of the places were really picturesque, the beaches and surf shops were great. However, the weather put pay to any kind of real beach action and Ben is a handful! We all had fun though and it was a great adventure.</p><p>We need a holiday to get over the holiday!</p>

          A82 and Glen Etive
        </a>
        - Black Mountain pass and really long straights, along with the spur of Glen Etive.
      </p><p /><p>The long awaited motorbike holiday to the North and West of Scotland finally came. Daddy went with Uncles Howard and Michael.</p><p>Day 1 - A 9am start which took us 430 miles north on a 9 hour trip to Dumbarton.</p><ul><li><i>Howard Filtering</i>Just past Birmingham we encountered traffic Jams. Daddy filtered between lanes 1 and 2. Cars could see him in their mirrors so moved out of my way. However, Howard was filtering between lanes 2 and 3, so the cars moved across into Howards path, narrowly missing a collision!
        </li><li><i>155 mph - Police</i>Tootling along at 80mph, Daddy saw Howard accelerating in his mirrors. Vroom. 155mph. Never seen that speed before... followed 2 minutes later by a Police Car going at similar speed. I thought Howard was done for. Luckily the Police Car was rushing to attend to an accident further along the motorway.
        </li><li><i>Glasgow thieving</i>Our first stop in Glasgow was for fuel which had an M and S attached. Saw two teenagers run out of the shop with two cases of Coke. A shop assistant then ran out of the shop 20 seconds later. By that time, the kids had scarpered.
        </li></ul><p>
        Day 2 - Argyll Tour. Our first taste of lochs, mountains and costal scenery. Route:
        <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&amp;saddr=dumbarton&amp;daddr=Rest+and+be+Thankful,+Argyll+and+Bute,+Argyll+and+Bute+to:B828+%4056.203065,+-4.915382+to:Inveraray+to:lochgilphead+to:Ellenabeich+to:Oban+to:56.461732,-4.850464+to:Glencoe&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=%3B%3BFTmXWQMdSv-0_w%3B%3B%3B%3B%3B%3B&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrcr=5&amp;mrsp=7&amp;sz=10&amp;via=2,7&amp;sll=56.439722,-4.850464&amp;sspn=0.5542,1.400757&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=56.375137,-4.9617&amp;spn=0.555141,1.400757&amp;t=h&amp;z=10">
          Dumbarton - Rest And Be Thankful - Inveraray - Seil - Oban - Glen Orchy - Glencoe
        </a></p><ul><li><i>Dumbarton Jog</i>Daddy rose at 6:15am to go on a 5 mile jog around Dumbarton taking in the football club and castle. Feet blistered in the Lego’s.
        </li><li><i>Weather</i>The weather throughout the week was pretty consistent. Rain in the mornings, broken sunshine in the afternoons. It was to be expected really. The rain didn't spoil the holiday.
        </li><li><i>Sites</i>We had our first taste of streams cascading down spectacular mountains as we passed Loch Lomond onto the picturesque village of Inveraray.
        </li></ul><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_24-05-Scotland-ObanCircular.jpg</src><caption>Inveraray</caption></image><ul><li><i>Isle Of Seil</i>We tried our luck over the 200 year old Atlantic Bridge
        </li><li><i>Taxi not for Mr Gay</i>Going through traffic in Oban, Daddy managed to get into a tussle with a taxi driver who wouldn't let him through. Eventually Daddy forced himself, leading the taxi driver to take a picture of his bike, I guess to hand into the police. Stupid taxi drivers think they have their own highway code!
        </li><li><i>Rapids</i>Stopped off along one of the first bit of single tracks to see the rapids through Glen Orchy Fan-bloody-tastic.
        </li><li><i>Best 'A' Road in the UK</i>The A82 from the Bridge Of Orchy to Glencoe is the most stunning bit of road to be seen, past the Black Mount mountains. Long 2 mile straights, mountains either side, long sweeping corners, no pot holes, repairs, drains, manhole covers... just tarmac bliss.
        </li><li><i>Restaurant in someone's front room</i>We stopped in Glencoe and our host Glencoe Jane booked us in the local restaurant which was situated in someone's front room. Very strange setup. Food was excellent.
        </li></ul><p>
        Day 3 - Travelling to the North Coast. Route:
        <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&amp;saddr=glencoe&amp;daddr=ardgay+to:tongue+to:bettyhill&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;mra=ls&amp;sll=57.600895,-4.722585&amp;sspn=2.148782,5.603027&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;t=h&amp;z=8">
          Glencoe - Loch Ness - Inverness - Easter Fearn - Loch Loyal - Tongue - Bettyhill
        </a></p><ul><li><i>Bad Weather Day</i>As the weather was pretty bad we decided to head as far north as possible and work our way down Scotland.
        </li><li><i>Overtaking</i>Michael desperately trying to overtake a lorry along Loch Ness for about 20 minutes. Once overtaken the lorry pulled off the road 30 seconds later!
        </li><li><i>Inverness</i>Didn't think much of Inverness. Another city.
        </li><li><i>Lairg to Tongue</i>Fantastic single track, great weather, lovely scenery! Howards best road ever at that point in time.
        </li></ul><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_25-15-Scotland-ToNorthCoast.jpg</src><caption>Easter Fearn</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_25-58-Scotland-ToNorthCoast.jpg</src><caption>Castle At Tongue</caption></image><ul><li><i>Bettyhill</i>Howard almost out of petrol, so stopped at Bettyhill which pleased Daddy as there was an unspoilt, coved, sandy beach. 'Now you won't be wanting to do that' line in a thick Scottish accent.
        </li></ul><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_25-71-Scotland-ToNorthCoast.jpg</src><caption>Bettyhill Beach</caption></image><p>

          Bettyhill - John O'Groats - Duncansby Head - Girnigoe Castle - Helmsdale - Ben Hope - Durness
        </a></p><ul><li><i>Costal Road - Best Yet</i>The long straights, the views over to the Orkneys and general picturesque views made this one of the most enjoyable rides as far as Reay where there were big industrial plants spoiling the view.
        </li><li><i>John O'Groats</i>We decided to do John O'Groats. Not too much there. We in fact went further north and east by a mile to Duncansby Head, which is actually further from Lands End.
        </li></ul><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_26-23-Scotland-NorthHighlands.jpg</src><caption>John O'Groats</caption></image><ul><li><i>East Coast</i>We continued down past Wick. A drag race ensued along some of the straights, passing Grinigoe Castle
        </li></ul><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_26-29-Scotland-NorthHighlands.jpg</src><caption>Girnigoe Castle</caption></image><ul><li><i>Cross Country - The midgeys</i>We moved onto the cross country routes heading towards Durness. We stopped off at a small loch to go on some rowing boats which were begging to be rowed! Within 2 minutes we were attacked by Midges’. Horrible. They got everywhere. Yuk.
        </li><li><i>Daddy mountain climb</i>Along the valley we stopped off and Daddy and Howard started to climb one of the mountains, Ben Hope. Daddy got quite high. However, Michael and Howard buggered off whilst Daddy was still half way up. Views of the valley were fantastic. Sound bounced all the way down.
        </li></ul><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_26-68-Scotland-NorthHighlands.jpg</src><caption>Martin having climbed up Ben Hope</caption></image><ul><li><i>21 mile Durness run - Best Road Ever</i>Well we ragged it once we hit the north coast road. Michael videoed it. A must see. Again hard to put into words the scenery, but loch + mountains + white top mountains + single track + lambs roaming the roads + high up + good, dry weather = Best journey experience ever.

          Durness - Loch Shin - Ullapool - Gruinard Beach - Annat
        </a></p><ul><li><i>Durness</i>Durness a funny place where there were a maximum 2 or 3 houses together. Some reason I thought it looked like the Falklands. Never been to the Falklands but it is what I imagine to be like.

There were hundreds of the things. Michael dispersed many of them with his hooter.
        </li><li><i>Glasses</i>Somehow, Michael's glasses flew off his face whilst riding and lost forever. A yokel, local said he'll keep a look out for them!
        </li><li><i>Ullapool</i>Ullapool was surrounded by mountains and had a huge loch. Looked like a toy town when we approach from up high in the hills. Had nice cup of tea by the sea.

C'est Beau.

Noise was half jet engine, half apologetic sneeze.

        See it<a href="http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=btQet4cWPOA">here</a>.
      </p><ul><li><i>The Torridon Hotel</i>
          After much discussion over price (Daddy tight fisted) we stayed at the
          <a href="http://www.lochtorridonhotel.com/">
            Torridon Hotel
          </a>
          . By far the best place. We had our own motel style block with a huge room.
        </li></ul><p>
        Day 6 - Applecross and Isle Of Skye. Route:

          Annat - Shieldaig - Applecross - Lochcarron - Portree, Skye - Kyle Of Lochalsh
        </a></p><ul><li><i>Breakfast</i>Daddy enjoyed breakfast as much as Michael hated it. It had no fry-up element to it at all. Continental styley all the way through.
        </li><li><i>Applecross</i>The north coastal part of Applecross forest had again scenery to die for. The southern end of the route included a climb on the motorbike up a huge mountain, shrouded in cloud so we could not see a lot. Half way up we saw a camper van with panicking occupants as it appeared there radiator was at the end of its life. Steam gushing out of the engine. What a place to break down.
        </li><li><i>Isle Of Skye</i>Seemed to take us ages to get going onto the Isle Of Skye. We notice a sharp incline in the amount of traffic. We stopped off in Portree. Michael asked a local if there cinema only has 12 year old films. Nice. Anyway Michael had 'bad vibes' about Skye so we returned to stay in the Kyle Of Lochalsh.

        </li><li><i>Jumps</i>The road along Glenn Nevis was incredibly windy and undulating. One found one point with potential motorbike jumping possibilities. Only Howard managed this feat.
        </li><li><i>Nevis Climb</i>Well not really. Howard and Daddy climbed up part of the mountain in the Nevis range to see the gorge with rushing water. Very pleasant.
        </li><li><i>Gey Mare's Tail Waterfall</i>The waterfall's view was partially blocked so Daddy decided to change into swimming trunks and t-shirt and attempt to clamber along the rocks to get closer. Once it was reached it was amazing to see the force and gusts of spray created from the waterfall. It was in its own cove with a mini beach. Daddy really enjoyed this bit.
        </li><li><i>Glenn Etive</i>Michael found a small excursion route along a valley which again hard to describe but was quite remote and extremely picturesque and tranquil.

    <title>Weston Swanage Holiday</title>
    <info>
		<p>Day minus 2</p><p>After waving Daddy off on his motorbike trip we headed to Ma Ma and Pop Pop's house. We played in the garden then went to the Gillingham Country Park. We had great fun rolling down the hill and making dens. From there we went to visit Teaky. Ben and Katie were brave enough to ride, but Joey was a little scared.</p><p>After tea and bath we all headed back home where Joey, Katie and Ben slept together.</p><p>Day minus 1</p><p>We went to church where we created lots of noise in the crèche together and were very naughty. Lily and Joey headed home while we went back to load the car with all our camping gear. By the time we left for Auntie Ellie's we couldn't fit another thing in. We had sleeping bags, pillows, food and clothes.</p><p>We slept at Auntie Ellie's and we were all very excited for the start of our holiday.</p><p>Day 1 - Setting Up</p><p>We squeezed into the car and headed for the service station to meet Ma Ma and Pop Pop. After Ma Ma's hourly caffeine injection and a go on the swings, we set off again in the direction of Swanage. We got stuck in lots of holiday traffic and got slightly lost, but eventually found our lovely campsite. Auntie Karen, Uncle Richard, Jon and Rachel were leaving Swanage after their holiday and helped us put up our tents. We have a new one this year, fortunately easy to assemble, although not easy enough for us to do it! Auntie Karen and Uncle Richard lent us their Lillo and bedding for added comfort. Once we said goodbye to Pop Pop who had to drive all the way home, we went for a walk to the cliffs. However, the path soon became too steep for the buggy and the little ones, so we returned. We cooked sausages on our little stove and went to bed. In the night mummy was woken twice with Ben and Jessica being sick over our lovely new tent and sleeping bags!</p><p>Day 2 - Weymouth</p><p>We walked to a nearby swing park where Auntie Ellie mistakenly threw Lily over a wall, thinking there was a platform on the other side. Unfortunately there wasn't and she fell six foot to the ground. Luckily, she only cried for a minute and was fine, so we were able to laugh about it.</p><p>We then headed off to Weymouth where we lost each other and couldn't find anywhere to park. After communicating through Pop Pop we were able to find each other on the beach. We had a picnic, a play in the sand and were allowed two goes on the fair. After this we all want to go on a donkey, (so Ma Ma got on her hands and knees!)... Katie's was the biggest, and Ben a little baby one called Daisy. Next we caught an open topped bus to Portland Bill. At first it was great fun, but as the road became more open the wind was so intense, so we had to go downstairs. We had ice cream, but were unable to go up the lighthouse as you had to be a metre tall.</p><p>We desperately needed the laundrette to clean the sleeping bags and as luck would have it, we found one in Wareham on the way to the campsite, which stayed open till 9pm and had a chip shop next door, so we were able to have tea whilst we did our washing. Jessie was sick again in the night.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_26-14-SwanageHoliday-Weymouth.jpg</src><caption>Eee-ore</caption></image><p>Day 3 - Farmer Parmers</p><p>We went for another go on the swings and then headed to Farmer Parmers. This was an excellent farm. We started by going in the play loft, and climbing haystacks and going down slides. There were tractors to ride, a great adventure playground and two huge bouncy castles. We hadn't found anywhere to buy a picnic, so decided to buy sausages there. In the afternoon we did the Woodland Walk, going over bridges and trying to spot Winnie The Pooh figures. We had a go in the Maize Maze and Katie and Ben got out first! The tractor ride was the bumpiest ever and verged on a white knuckle ride. We had an ice cream and Mummy was so busy trying to keep the wasps off Ben, she dropped hers without even having a bite. Finally there was some brilliant Go-Karts. The children too little to ride them, but they had seats on the back so the adults ride them around the bumpy track. We stopped at the Laundrette again and also bought a BBQ. At the campsite we cooked a delicious meal; sausages, burgers and marshmallows and also attempted a few campfire songs. Jessica was sick again!</p><p>Day 4 - Steam Train Ride</p><p>We caught the steam train, from Swanage to Corfe. Ben wet himself on the train after the guard pointed us in the wrong direction for the toilet and couldn't get there quick enough. He spent the rest of the day in Joey's swimming shorts. We found a little, old fashioned sweet shop in Corfe and were allowed sweets from Auntie Ellie's budget. Mummy had fun looking around Enid Blyton's shop. We didn't climb to the castle as we felt the little ones wouldn't make it, although Katie was desperate to try. Instead, we went into the model village and had great fun playing giant connect four, Jenga, hop scotch and croquet on a hill! One funny thing Katie and Joey found a little wishing well and put in a penny and made a wish. Katie started to cry because her wish hadn't come true. After eventually prizing out of her what it was, she said she wished to have found sweets in her pocket. Luckily, Mummy had some left from earlier and was able to convince Katie the fairy had put them in the wrong pocket. Katie was delighted. Then, Joey started crying as he wished for a motorbike and there was none in his pockets. Unfortunately none of the adults were able to produce a motorbike!</p><p>We caught the steam train back to Swanage and had a play on the beach. Katie and Mummy were brave enough to paddle up to our tummy's as it was quite cold. Jessie was not sick, thank goodness.</p><p>Day 5 - Studland Bay</p><p>We drove to Studland Bay. The weather was a little better, although still not hot. Ma Ma bought all the children a pair of Crocs (shoes), and we tried them out on the rocks looking for crabs. We didn't find any, however, people with special crab lines were catching loads, which fascinated us, using bacon as bait. Auntie Charlotte joined us, and made us boats in the sand. Katie and Mummy swum out to a boat. Auntie Ellie said we wouldn't able to, and lost the bet and was supposed to cook us bacon on the following day! Ben on the other hand screamed blue murder when mummy naughtily forced him into the sea, thinking he would enjoy it if he just got in there. We went for a walk along the cliff top and found an old fort. Katie and Joey had great fun playing in it.</p><p>We said goodbye to Ma Ma, who had to return home with Auntie Charlotte, and we went back to the campsite for our final night.</p><p>Day 6 - Littlehampton Beach Party</p><p>If we thought we couldn't fit anymore in to the car on the way to Swanage, on the way back we had the additional Lillo, two pillows, a double duvet and a wind break! We got so stressed trying to fit it all in, put the tents down and keep our eyes on the children. We set off in the direction of Littlehampton for Rachel's 30th birthday beach party. Four hours later we got there! We hadn't realized it would be such a long journey especially with all the holiday traffic we got stuck in. It was also a very hot day. However, the children were very well behaved in the car. We had great fun on the beach.</p><p>We had a BBQ and an ice cream. We went on Rachel's kayak and swum up to our necks in the sea again. We didn't leave Littlehampton until 6pm. We were helping one of Rachel's friends fly a kite. We ate a picnic tea on the way back to Auntie Ellie's where we stayed the night.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_08_30-14-SwanageHoliday-Littlehampton.jpg</src><caption>Kayak</caption></image>

    <title>Dixons Of Deal</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went down to see cousins Dixon down at their home in Deal. It was nice to see the whole Dixon clan. We had a lovely Fish and Chip lunch, and a trip down to Tides for a swim. Katie and Ben loved the long, windy slide. You could tell Yasmin enjoyed the water as well. We popped back again and played in the back garden where Ben managed to through the ball into the pond, which we hadn't managed to retrieve! We also learned the great news that Sharon is about 12 weeks pregnant! Woo hoo.</p>

    <title>Family Picnic, Littlehampton 10km, Henry's 5th Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>We split in the morning. Daddy went with Ellie, Rachel, Jon and Richard for a 10 kilometre run down along Littlehampton Promenade. Conditions were good, although preparation was poor. Anyway Daddy managed it in 53 minutes which he was pleased with.</p><p>Meanwhile the rest of us went over to the same Gym Katie had her birthday, this time for Henry's celebrations.</p><p>We all met again in the afternoon for a Barnett family picnic down at Frimley Lodge Park. We had a game of cricket and a go on the steam trains. Ben and Joey particularly played really well with each other. You can tell they are going to be good friends. Mummy came rushing in with a cake, and we all sang happy birthday to Jessica and shared a bottle of Champagne.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/IMG_2094.jpg</src><caption>Karen and Katie</caption></image>

    <title>Photo's - Ikea</title>

		<p>For some reason we went all the way over to High Wycombe to get our photo taken by the pros. Getting Ben to stop saying a continuous 'cheeeeeese', Katie to give a broad smile and Jessica to look at the camera in a cramped space is not that easy! Anyway we got some lovely pictures taken. We walked around the town and visited the office where Daddy worked for six months and where he made his first phone call to ask Mummy out on a date!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_09_13-05-ProShots.jpg</src><caption>Family Portrait</caption></image><p>In the afternoon we went to Ikea at Wembley.... always a known as a stress test assault course, and this was no exception. Anyway we didn't get a dining room chair, cutlery or a dinner set which we had intended to get.</p><p>We returned home to watch Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</p>

    <title>Steam Trains and Birthday Parties</title>
    <info>
		<p>We split into two teams today. Mother and Eldest daughter went to church and two birthday parties.</p><p>The rest went with the Fars down to Alresford to catch a steam train. We huffed and puffed a return journey to Ropley and back where Farfar and Ben made a detour to see Thomas who was 'snoozing' under the covers.</p><p>After some lunch, we headed off again this time to Alton and back. Ben was getting into the spirit, announcing Ropley as Broccoli and 'Signal Box' and 'Siginal Box'! Jessica on the other hand was 100% fidget box. She seemed to have a smile on her face all day.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_09_14-Watercress.jpg</src><caption>Train Cranks</caption></image>

    <info>
		<p>We popped over to Susan's for a birthday breakfast. We sat and chatted. Ben was taken with Playstation 3 and the Star Wars game. I'm sure if we had it at home he wouldn't be off it. We later went for a walk and a go on the swings at the back of the house.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_09_20-22-Susans31stBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Birthday Time</caption></image><p>In the afternoon we went swimming. Bath time and Jessica now thinks it a good idea to lay a couple of logs in the bath itself! How pleasant. This has been going on for about a week now. Also since her birthday, we have put her in a strict routine, which means she sleeps pretty much all the way through for the first time and wakes at about 6:15am each morning. Finally some rest.</p>

    <title>Thorpe Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was the annual Weston trip away. This time Thorpe Park and along came Howard, Susan and her son, Sean. We started in Octopus Land which was for the kiddies and then made our way around the park. Ben was a bit of a woos and got seriously grumpy on some rides, because he couldn't be the driver! Katie loved the rapid river, but hated the log flume!</p><p>
        Daddy went on some of the more adult rides.<a href="http://www.thorpepark.com/rides-stealth.php">Stealth</a>, the 0-80mph rollercoaster in 2.7 seconds, tip toeing over the top of the arch at 200 feet. Well, we were just queuing and this one time (at band camp!), the coaster did not make the tip-toe, and came rushing down backwards towards the start point. Was it going to crash? Thankfully no, the brakes were applied, but it was pretty scary to see it malfunction. The engineers were called, and we left the queue. We did return later, and Daddy thought it was the most exhilarating ride he has ever been on. Beats all the ones in America he's been on.

    <title>Charlotte's New House, Rare Breads Farm</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went down to see Charlotte's new house which she is sharing with two other friends. Just a walk away from the hospital she is working at.</p><p>
        The children were playing havoc so we got out quick. Charlotte was sick out of the car twice en-route to the
        <a href="http://www.choldertoncharliesfarm.com/">
          Rare Breeds Farm
        </a>
        in Cholderton. The weather was great and there were plenty of things to entertain the children. We of course saw a noisy Farfar in his pen. We had a trip around the field in the tractor, played on the adventure playground, there were monsters in the maze, saw Auntie Ellie do a summersault on the trampoline and played monsters again in the soft play. Overall a great time for the kids.

A new destination in Calshot. However, beforehand we stopped off at Hythe to eat our picnic at the waterfront and saw lots of sail boats, seagulls and a big fish. We then hopped onto the stony beach of Calshot. The weather was great and beach quite empty. We collected lots of interesting stones and shells and went for a walk up and down past all the beach huts.</p><p>In the late afternoon we had a plethora of people over to watch the England international.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_10_11-38-HytheCalshot.jpg</src><caption>Jessica taking a stroll on the beach</caption></image>

    <title>James Ball's Stag Weekend</title>
    <info>
		<p>Friday:</p><p>
        Daddy trekked down to Bristol with the boys for James' stag weekend. We had Barrie and Michael as drivers and straight away they went the wrong way down the M3! Down the 303, as Baz calls it, we took direction's off 'Pat' to a lovely pub in Corton, called the
        <a href="http://www.thedove.co.uk/">
          Dove Inn
        </a>
        . The landlord was a little shocked to see the stag donned in a lurid, green mankini! He eventually came around, and after shocking a few of the civilized locals, and a go behind the bar, James and the rest of us moved onto three other pubs. One of which a rockwilder greeted us by the door. Needless to say he was a curious dog! Just glad he had eaten earlier!
      </p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_11_01-11-JamesStag.jpg</src><caption>Mankini Man pulling some Butcombe</caption></image><p>We eventually made it to the Premier Inn, Bristol. We had a spot of bother getting the minibus into a height restricted car park. A wheel spin and a bit of speed allowed us to scrape under the car park roof, leaving us with red paint etched on top! Oops.</p><p>A spruce up, and a trip to Frankie and Benny's for some nosh, we were now setup for the rest of the evening. A casino was first. Dog and Tony ended roughly even playing blackjack for a few hours, whilst the rest of us were trying to nurse Bazza through a friendly game of poker without him causing too much offense and noise! Oi Dunlop, come here! Snap Rules!! What?</p><p>Next in order was some Tino style walking towards the bars at the canal. After some had a Martini, we proceeded back to the hotel, for a cheeky chinky at 3am! Not all made it back in one piece, Mr Aves, lost his footing and got some almighty cuts and bruises all over his face.... or was it a mugging? Kingster?</p><p>Saturday:</p><p>Having scraped through the car park height restrictor on the way in, we had the same problem on the way out. We let some of the tyres down hoping to reduce the height, thus no scraping. However, it made no difference, and again we all cringed as we could hear the scraping noise as we departed the hotel for the quad biking. Martin Ball was convinced he had been at the quad biking venue before, but the organiser cast aspersions over that claim. James' and Emma's dads joined us.</p><p>On this bitterly cold morning, we had a small course to complete on a time trial basis. Some got it on two wheels within 10 seconds (huh erm), some aborted the bike by jumping off it (Dog), and some were obviously good at it. I think Duncan and Barrie were the top two candidates. A great laugh.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_11_01-24-JamesStag.jpg</src><caption>The Quad Biking Krew!</caption></image><p>We then descended to a local pub where we had some lunch and played some friendly poker.... and a final game for cash, which Tony walked away with the winnings.</p><p>At the business end of the stag do, we caught taxi's to the canal region again. Bazza leaning into one of the taxi's, saying "it's ###### Bin Laden driving" - welcome to our diplomat, Barrie! The cabbie just looked so disappointed! Anyway after the first establishment was ticked off, we hit Reflex, a 80's nightclub where James had to fulfil the dares on his t-shirt....which he managed to do. Another late return back to the hotel.</p><p>Sunday:</p><p>We returned home. Cheers guys for such a great weekend.</p><ul><li><i>Stag</i>James Ball

    <title>Trick or Treating and Fireworks in Istead Rise</title>
    <info>
		<p>On Friday, we went to Auntie Karen's house, for a little party. Katie dressed as a pumpkin and Ben was Darth Vader. We made decorations and did some apple bobbing. Katie and Summer's cousins Amber and Kyle were brilliant and had a great time. Ben was not feeling well and would not put his head in the bowl. We then drove to Ma Ma and Pop Pop's to go trick or treating or tickle and treating as Katie calls it. Ma Ma was running late (lost in Bournemouth) so we had to drag a reluctant pop Pop to come with us as Mummy wasn't sure whose doors to knock on. Ben wasn't into it as he was still feeling ill. we did about five houses and collected lots which made Ben perk up. Katie had a feather duster to tickle people as a trick but fortunately did not need to use it.</p><p>We arrived at Ma Ma and Pop Pop's house. We had just had our dinner when some children came 'trick or treating'. Of course Pop Pop had not bought enough sweets so Mama cheekily took some of ours to give to the callers (I will NEVER forgive her for this!).</p><p>Anyway we went to bed and in the morning set off in the pouring rain for London. I will never understand adults - I mean why spend a wet and windy day in Canary Wharf waiting for some people whom I had never met before to go on to a boring (and when I say boring, I mean boring) exhibition where there were black and white pictures of lots of poor looking people, when you could be at a soft play or something.</p><p>Well at last we were out of that gruesome place and headed off to Weatherspoons where I had a yummy spaghetti bolognaise. Ben was a bit of a pain (but then he didn't feel well bless him). I have to say I rather took to Uncle Dave and Auntie Rita - they were complimentary about me and I like that. At last Mummy had had enough and suggested we went home and left Mama and Pop Pop with their friends. Boy was I glad to get home!</p><p>That evening we watched telly before enjoying fireworks. I use the term enjoy loosely as Ben felt too ill to watch and went to bed and I was just too worried about this huge firework that someone called Dave (a different Dave) had brought. Actually it was a bit of a let-down when it was eventually lit.</p>

    <title>Swimming, Fireworks</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the afternoon Daddy, Katie and Ben played at Farnborough swimming pool. Katie is happier swimming under water, than she is above! Ben on the other hand rather not get wet at all. As always we had great fun playing sharks and basically kill Daddy! Jess has a big tooth coming through so she went with Mummy to do a spot of Christmas shopping.</p><p>Late in the evening we packed a thermos flask of soup and trekked to the top of Frimley Green hill to watch the surrounding fireworks. In a 180 degree turnaround from last year, Katie couldn't get enough of them. She was loving it. Ben was Ben, and Jess didn't mind them. On the way home we stopped by Grove school to see their display. It was really good, although we must have looked like pikeys watching it from outside the school! They were pretty loud, but Jessica didn't show any negative emotion at all.</p>

Ben always picked blue. There were a couple of accidents which required medical attention.... otherwise the hundred or so competitors in about a dozen races got around safely, if not spectacularly.</p><p>We had comfy chairs and a small picnic. Luckily the weather was good, but there was plenty of mud for the kiddies to get stuck into.... which we felt when we stood behind the start line. We got sprayed with mud!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_11_16-00-MotoCross.jpg</src><caption>Motocross Montage</caption></image>

Mummy didn't think much of it because it wasn't a traditional Bond movie. Daddy just enjoyed being at the cinema again.</p>

At 10:30 Mummy received a call from a drunk Ma Ma and Pop Pop asking for a lift home. They had been out to Ma Ma's Christmas work do. Mummy decided to go in her pyjamas to repay Pop Pop for all the times he came to collect her and her friends in his dressing gown and slippers!</p>

    <title>James and Emma's Wedding - Visit Ma Ma and Pop Pop</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy and ourselves went to Ma Ma and Pop Pop's for the weekend.</p><p>We went to Gravesend Christmas shopping. Ma Ma bought Ben a new snuggle blanket as Ben's smelt so bad of wee and she couldn't get the smell out. He chose a Spiderman one and Katie got some stationary for her teaching game. We had a drink and a cake and a play on the slide. In the afternoon we went to Mummy and Auntie Ellie's old junior school for their Christmas fair and then on to ride Teaky. Ben and Joey went on her no problems but when Katie got on with Ma Ma she was a bit lively and Katie got scared. Mummy had Ben and Jess, so poor Auntie Ellie had to rescue her as she was screaming, hopefully it hasn't put her off horses for life.</p><p>
        Daddy on the other hand rode to Swansea and made it with 15 minutes to spare before the coach left from the
        <a href="http://www.thetowersswanseabay.com/">
          Hotel
        </a>
        to the wedding venue,
        <a href="http://www.neath-porttalbot.gov.uk/default.aspx?page=1325&amp;lang=en">
          Margam Park
        </a>
        . It was a beautiful setting. Greeting us was the 30 strong Porthcawl Male choir who were fantastic. They banged out some familiar songs which was good to hear, nothing like Daddy's version of 'Slide Away' thankfully.
      </p><p>The wedding itself was held within the impressive Orangery. A civil affair, which was light hearted. Emma looked top dollar of course. The deed was done, and we ventured to get some mulled wine and tasty salmon puff pastry things! Daddy met Martin's girlfriend, Vicky, for the first time. She was very socialble and friendly. So pleased for Marts.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_12_06-06-JamesEmmaWedding.jpg</src><caption>Deal or No Deal?</caption></image><p>Daddy ventured around Margam Park and took some boring photo's. Barrie was getting a bit worried about his best man's speech. His parents were there as well, so it was good to catch up with them. We sat down for the wedding breakfast, late afternoon. Most of the 80 guests were of similar age so it was good to chat to some of Emma's college friends.</p><p>All the speeches were good.... even the Father of the Bride. Some English-Welsh jokes. James' speech was good... and he seemed to enjoy doing it. The opposite could be said for Bazza, obviously really nervous but the content was very good. He had to pull some of his Welsh jokes out in the end..... 'What's the best thing to come out of Wales?'...... 'The M4'!! Boom Boom.</p><p>We begun to drink and drink. Chocolate fountain and pork buffet. The disco was in full swing.... Again slightly different, there was a chap who sang all the songs. He was very good. The three brothers did some rock to the Motley Crew. They bounced around and pretended to play guitars. It was very funny.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_12_06-83-JamesEmmaWedding.jpg</src><caption>The Ball Crew</caption></image><p>The cake cutting was next... with Lightsabers. Very cool.... If only Ben could see these bad boys. £150 a pop. Needless to say Duncan took his 'babies' away fairly promptly! The wedding ended with plenty more discoing. Martin Aves danced to Raining Men by the way! Never thought I'd see the day. Vicky split her dress.... and didn't we hear about it!</p><p>Midnight struck and before we turned back into pumpkins we returned back to the hotel on the coach. Everyone in good spirits. Anyway Daddy, a sleeping Barrie and James' Auntie Carol were the last men standing at 4am!</p><p>Some really nice touches at the wedding. The choir, the setting, the people, the speeches, the CD, the singer, the photo/signing book, the Motley Crew rendition, but sorry Emma, the one that eclipsed it all was the lightsaber cake cutting!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_12_06-72-JamesEmmaWedding.jpg</src><caption>Han and Leah</caption></image><p>The 4 hour journey was eventful. Ice welcomed me on the bike! However, the cold was the least of my problems. There was so much salt on the motorway that I had to continually stop to clean the visor on the helmet. Also, a car raced in front of me, pulled on his hazards and told me to pull over. He had seen my wallet fall out of my pocket whilst riding along and a number of coins had hit his car at 80 mph! Ooops. I walked a mile up the M4 looking for it, but alas I couldn't find it!</p>

    <title>Tower Bridge Exhibition, Father Christmas at Selfridges</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        We drove up to Turnham Green and caught the tube to Tower Gateway where we were greeted with a deluge of weather! The big debate was, do we take the double buggy or not? Important strategic question. We decided not. Anyway we trotted across to
        <a href="www.towerbridge.org.uk/">
          Tower Bridge
        </a>
        and went up the lift to one of the two walkways which connect the towers 20 metres from the ground. We all enjoyed playing with the computers and Daddy liked looking across the views of London, even though it was a bit grey! Jessica was finally freed and was toddling about everywhere. She could be real noisy.
      </p><p>After looking west on the second walkway, we sunk down into the engine rooms, and sneaked some lunch in by the coal bunker! We departed Tower Bridge on the south side and caught a bus to Covent Garden. There was the inevitable street entertainer. He spent 10 minutes balanced on top of a ladder, to blow and pop a rubber glove on his head! It's all about the quality! We visited some knick-knack shops which were quite quaint. Katie has only a pair of canvas type shoes, which were soaked along with her tights. So we popped into an expensive camping shop and bought some boots and a pair of kids socks for £7.50. Daddy almost had a heart attack!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_12_13-10-TowerBridgeSelfridges.jpg</src><caption>Victorian Gays</caption></image><p>We walked down to the Strand and caught a double-decker which passed along the pretty Christmas lights down Regent's Street and Oxford Street to Selfridges. Needless to say it was a tad busy in there. After looking around the toy department and queuing for the toilets, we went on the magical train journey to Lapland. It was presented really well and have been looking forward to the experience for the past week. After our short train ride, we were escorted by the lady elf into Father Christmas's grotto. He engaged with Katie and Ben straight away, by muddling their names up! Jessica on the other hand wasn't so sure. Anyway Katie wished for some necklaces’ and Ben some Star Wars'ez, as he says. We posed for some photos, before Father Christmas gave each of us a parting gift. A nice Christmas book each!</p><p>We exited and marched down to Marble Arch tube. Jessica put a smile on people’s hearts in the tube as she was laughing and smiling away and determined to wander around the carriage! We finally returned home, via the chip shop for a treat. Although late, we proceeded to decorate the Christmas tree and front room. What a lovely Christmas day we had.</p>

    <title>Peter Pan on Ice, Fars, Elders to stay</title>
    <info>
		<p>After church, Mummy and Katie went with some school friends to watch a pantomime, Peter Pan on ice. Katie absolutely loved it and in her words, "didn't want it to end".</p><p>
        Meanwhile Daddy, Ben and Jessica went over to the Fars to play trains and watch the Snowman. We had
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%86bleskiver">
          æbleskive
        </a>
        which Daddy hasn't had for a long, long time. Yummy.
      </p><p>Uncle Michael is in Malaysia on business and Auntie Ellie had to work the 'nudist' shift at Alton leisure centre, so Daddy was entrusted to play with Lily and Joey who came over. We all played in the bedroom. We dressed Lily up in one of Katie's Disney Princess dress', put a hair band in, some rings on her fingers and some pink heeled shoes. Cannot say that Daddy doesn't play girlie dressing up! Ben and Joey proceeded to kill, trample and poke Daddy and then each other, which Jessica took exception to and cried whenever this happened and tried to push the boys off Daddy! Mummy and Katie later returned from the panto to join in the fun. We had dinner, a bath and story time before going to bed at 7:15pm. Auntie Ellie came later and all stayed the night.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_12_14-16-Fars.jpg</src><caption>A Bath Full Of People</caption></image>

    <title>Tom's 3rd Birthday, Sanders and West’s Over</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was Ben's friend Tom's 3rd birthday party which was in two parts. First up was soft play, bouncy castle and crash mats. Some energy was released. Best game was 'washing machines'. We then moved along for some food and party games. What a contrast in moods. When Katie got knocked out of a game she left with a smile, Benny left in a grump! Tom was in great form telling his Daddy when the music should be played in pass the parcel! We had a great time.</p><p>We sprinted home to meet the Sanders and West crews. We swapped presents. Ben strangely was given a Star Wars ship and T-shirt, Katie a board game which she played 3 times and some boots. Jessica received a much needed coat, drum and a car. We played all afternoon, then watched the final of Strictly Come Dancing!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_12_20-30-Tom3rdBdaySandersWests.jpg</src><caption>Jessica and her new drum!</caption></image>

    <title>Pantomime: Jack And The Beanstalk</title>
    <info>
		<p>End of Term: Katie came home yesterday, the only one in the class to receive a certificate for her progress in 'phonics and writing'. Well done Katie, we are all very proud of your progress this term. She is really enjoying school.</p><p>A late Christingle service which Katie and Ben enjoyed was proceeded with lunch then a trip to Oliver Strangle's house for some Christmas cheer. They live down Buckhurst Road which is where Mummy wants to live. We didn't spend too long there.</p><p>The Fars kindly came around to babysit Jessica, whilst the rest of us met with Ellie and Joey at Camberley Civic Centre for this year’s panto performance of Jack and the Beanstalk. Apparently it had some Emmerdale, Neighbours and Home and Away actor in it, Richard Grieve. We hadn't heard of him.</p><p>It started off very scarily which Joey didn't cope with too well. For the rest of the performance whenever 'Fleshcreep' appeared on stage Ellie had to cover his eyes! Ben was tittering on the edge, but as the performance went on he was more relaxed. Katie just loved it from start to finish. You can tell she was really into it.</p><p>The production itself was good, although not as last years. Some of the jokes were terrible. However, it was very enjoyable and most important of all the children enjoyed it. Ben's reaction to a lightsaber fight was a picture of joy. The show lasted 2 hours.</p><p>Afterwards we popped into McDonalds for some reason! The children were all on a high. Milkshakes aren't what they used to be though in McD's. A good afternoon.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_12_21-11-McDonalds.jpg</src><caption>The children!</caption></image>

    <title>Christmas Eve</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy returned home at 2:30pm and soon after we all went to the Fars for a traditional Danish meal. We were joined by the Tremears. Katie and Ben had some bits of this tasty spread. Jessica wolfed down whatever was in front of her. It was pretty manic really. After chocolate log and risalamande, which Farfar won, we moved down to the main event. Throughout the evening we were tracking, on the internet, where Father Christmas was in the world. He had gone west from Australia and was now in Iran!</p><p>Katie and Ben were busy earlier sorting the presents outs into piles of different recipients! Anyway the main event arrived and we were handing the presents out enthusiastically... a bit quicker than the normal Gay pace of one at a time.</p><p>Katie's haul included some books and a stationary set, Ben got a Denmark football strip and a lightsaber, Jessica a rabbit teddy bear, a book and a toy. Katie was excited at opening her presents, Ben I think was a bit over roared and surprisingly didn't seem to get it, and Jessica was a rampant present opener. It didn't matter if they were for her or not!</p><p>We had a game of bingo before returning home to put some reindeer food on the front path and a cup of milk and a biscuit for FC himself. Daddy returned to the Fars for some more games, whilst Mummy later went to midnight mass.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_12_24-09-ChristmasEve.jpg</src><caption>Present time</caption></image>

    <title>Christmas Day</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy and Daddy were awoken surprisingly not really early. 6:45am this year. Luckily Father Christmas had visited all five of us and had it away with the milk and biscuit!</p><p>We squashed into Katie and Ben's bedroom first and FC had been particularly generous one feels. Katie's main presents were a set of Barbie's, a mini washing line!!! a Princess Jasmine outfit and what she had asked for, a snowflake necklace!</p><p>Ben received a Star Wars poster, DVD, another lightsaber (green) and some t-shirts. Needless to say he was very happy. Jessica got a keyboard, a dolly with smelly hair, a mobile phone (don't worry it is a toy one) and some other smaller girlie bits.</p><p>We then moved downstairs to open the presents under the tree from friends..... we were present'ed out!</p><p>Mummy went to church whilst the rest of us went to the Fars again for Christmas breakfast, which was a selection of giffler and fresh rolls. We again opened the rest of our presents and played. Mummy returned from church, so we hot footed it down to Kent to see Ma Ma, Pop Pop and the Elder clan. Unfortunately Charlotte had Christmas shifts at work, so couldn't make it, instead spending the day with her ex-boyfriend, Steve.</p><p>Lunch first up. We had one of the three turkey's that Pop Pop had cooked. The kiddies had their own table which never remained calm throughout. There was plenty of quantity and quality on the dining table. A traditional spread. After, we rolled out of the house and walked to the Fitzgerald household.... which reminds me of a Mother-In-Law'ism.</p><p>Yesterday, Helen had asked when the church service was at St. Nicholas. Ma Ma had said 11:15 thinking Helen meant the midnight mass service. They didn't turn up. Instead the Fitzgerald's turned up to church this morning when most of the congregation were walking out!</p><p>We returned to open the mass of presents from the Weston's and Barnett's. Jessmunta received a mini trampoline, Ben a Thomas The Tank Engine mountain and Katie a cupcake maker, a CD karaoke player, and some bits and bobs for her teaching games where she plays her teacher Miss Morris.</p><p>We tidied and played with some of the presents then went to bed after a spot of tea. The adults stayed up to play some games and watch Gavin and Stacey!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_12_25-00-ChristmasDay.jpg</src><caption>A compendium of present openings.</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_12_25-31-ChristmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Present time</caption></image>

    <title>New Years Eve</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we popped over to the Fars for some games. Ben asks for the train set every time, but only plays with it for 10 minutes! Still I think Daddy and Farfar get more enjoyment from constructing the track layout! Mummy was scarily quite convincing as a teacher when we played schools.</p><p>Couple of hours later we left the Fars, went home for some lunch and prepared for our New Year’s Party! Woo Hoo. First up the Elders and the kiddies version of New Years Eve. We played some party games and had tea. We then had 3 instalments for bath time! We went to bed like good children.</p><p>
        Karen, Rich, Rachel and Jon then arrived a little later to ignite the Stephens' Vs Weston's battle. It was pointed out that there weren't actually any Weston's or Stephens' in attendance, but that was a mere detail! Top game of the evening undoubtedly went to the

          Speed Stacking Cups.
        </a>
        Gay's were the worst and Gildewell's the best! There was a food interlude, which included some pork that had been BBQ'ed in the near freezing temperatures.
      </p><p>The teams seem to swap around so difficult to say who won in the evening overall, but it was a laugh. Mummy had a few to drink and felt the effects the day after. We had some visitors, which drip fed through to the lounge throughout the evening. All but Ben visited the downstairs. Lily was positively in party mode.</p><p>Midnight came and we all tried to sing Auld Lang Syne. We carried on until about 1:30am when our guest left and we went to bed.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2008/2008_12_31-13-NewYearsEve.jpg</src><caption>Ben training</caption></image>

    <title>What if we had 5 children?</title>
    <info>
		<p>Micheal back to working abroad and Ellie also working, we had the pleasure of Joey and Lilzo for half the day. They came late the night before, so this morning our first chance to play. It was really, really cold. Well below freezing. The tenpin bowling was all booked up, so we foolishly decided to go to the army swings. Everything we quite slippery, including the slide, which made us go down extra fast! We played a mixture of Star Wars, glueing and dressing up. At one point we ganged up on Daddy with our Bob The Builder gear. Katie was sawing my neck, Joey drilling into the side of his head, Lily hammering his head and Ben gouge his eyes out with the tip of a screwdriver. Great!</p><p>In the afternoon Ben went to watch the Aladin panto at Woking, with Ma Ma, Pop Pop, Great Grandma, Great Granddad and Uncle Peter. He then went to stay the night at Ma Ma and Pop Pop's.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_01_10-02-JoeyLilyToStay.jpg</src><caption>Frosty playtime</caption></image>

    <title>What if we had 2 children?</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        With Ben still out, the rest of us went up to the <a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/">Science Museum</a>. We parked close by, Daddy quickly went to get loads of treats for lunch, and then we walked through the University to get to the museum.
      </p><p>Mummy and Daddy had a 'discussion' about the dog, Laika, who was the first dog in space. Mummy believed it was the only passanger on Sputnik 2. However, Daddy laughed that she believed the dog could pilot a space rocket on it's own into space.</p><p>Jessica was contented in her pushchair, Katie showed some interest in the older exhibits. Mummy and Daddy reminised over the 80's and 90's collection of electrical goods and computers. Were Nintendo Gameboy's really that big and chunky?</p><p>
        The girls tummy's were growing rather fond of the lunch packed.... so we stopped for a bit on the third floor. After lunch we moved through to the interactive bits and pieces, known as the
        <a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/galleries/launchpad.aspx">
          Launchpad
        </a>
        . It was quite manic in there with so many parents and children milling about from one apparatus to another. Kaite liked the one where she had to pedal to make electricity for a light. There were loads of things to for her to do.
      </p><p>
        We later went down to <a href="http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/galleries/the_garden.aspx">'The Garden'</a> which was aimed at under 5's. Something down there that kept Jessica entertained. She liked banging on the xylaphone!
      </p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_01_11-00-ScienceMuseum.jpg</src><caption>Science Museum</caption></image><p>On returning to the car we couldn't find the keys! Of course the car was left unlocked and the keys found on the drivers seat!</p><p>We returned home and were met by Ma Ma, Pop Pop, Uncle Peter and of course Ben.</p>

		<p>In the morning we played around the house. Benny enjoyed playing trains. Katie went to Leah Somner's 6th birthday party. It was refreshing to see it was a house party, with face painting and normal games! It was a girls only party. Daddy got as far as the front door!</p><p>Meanwhile the rest of us went over to visit the West's briefly. It was Laura's 28th birthday.</p><p>In the afternoon we all went over to Fizzy Kids for a run around in the soft play. In the evening we sat to have tea watch Wipeout.</p><p>This week Daddy managed to contact a distant Uhrskov relative in Denmark which was nice.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_01_17-02-BenTrain.jpg</src><caption>Ben in training</caption></image>

    <title>Lost Teady Bear - Family Gathering</title>
    <info>
		<p>Jessica unwittingly had lost Katie's teddy bear, 'Bear Bear', during the week. So Katie and mummy made posters and stuck them around the Green in Frimley Green. At lunchtime we received a call that a bear which looked like the one in the picture was found at One Stop on the counter. We later trotted down and guess what... Bear Bear and Katie were again re-united. Just a number of things: 1) Not sure putting posters around with our home phone number was a good idea. 2) For someone to describe the bear looking like it did in the picture. Well you would have to have a good imagination. 3) And thirdly the woman who rang happened to be one of Katie's classmates mother!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_01_18-03-JoeyLilyToStayII.jpg</src><caption>Katie and here poster</caption></image><p>After retrieving the bear we went over to the new swing park over in Windlesham. It was a shame to see the old 80's style park go. It was bitterly cold, but the children enjoyed it, especially the swinging basket.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_01_18-13-JoeyLilyToStayII.jpg</src><caption>Katie and Ben enjoying the park</caption></image><p>We stood the cold no more and returned home. We had visits from Ellie, Joey, Lily and all four grandparents. Needless to say it was a bit manic. Katie played schools for ages with the Fars. She is a very convincing teacher! Ellie went to work, so the five children were all bathed, fed and put to bed for the night.</p>

    <title>Motorbike Crash!</title>
    <info>
		<woops rating="7" woopstitle="Motorbike Crash!"><p>On the way home from work, it's dark and a lot of traffic about. I'm on the main road travelling 30 or 35mph sitting behind a white van at a reasonable distance.</p><p>All of a sudden a car pulls out from a side turning after the van passes the junction. I have a split second to react, skid and slide into the door of the car which pulled out. I catch the car at an angle and bounce of the door and fall into a heap in the middle of the busy road. It all happened so quick.</p><p>Then the next bit was strange. I lay in the road, not hurt, but for some reason I didn't get up straight away. It took a couple of seconds. I remained so calm, I wondered if I lay on the road because it was nice to have a rest and a lie down! Mmm. Anyway as I say I'm not sure what happened in those few seconds.</p><p>Thankfully the car behind had stopped in time. The car I hit stopped and the 17 year old got out to check I was OK and apologised. I managed to pick the bike up and move it to the side of the road. The chap looked more shaken than myself. I told him not too worry and that it was just an accident. What I was most concerned about was the state of the bike. It was the front wheel that hit the car. It was hard to tell in the dark. I took the chaps details, and just rode home. There didn't seem to be anything of concern. Just the gear peg may have been damaged a bit as it was difficult to traverse through the gears.</p><p>I couldn't blame the chap. He didn't see me behind the van, and he would have to push himself out of the junction in order to join the busy road, otherwise he'd be there forever. I could easily do what he's done.</p></woops>

    <title>Fars, Another Leah Party, Pirbright Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Katie went to another Leah's birthday. Again the parents went to alot of effort. It had a 'crafty' theme. Katie came back with a heart, bag and some home made biscuits.</p><p>Whilst she was there, the rest of us popped around to the Fars for a cuppa and then on to the swings at Heatherside.</p><p>In the afternoon we went down a really bumpy, puddley road. Finally we stopped and went for a walk. Of course all of us children got completely soaked in the puddles even though we had boots on. We could see really far. We saw Guildford cathedral from a distance. A lovely walk. Definately go back there.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_01_24-19-Pirbright.jpg</src><caption>Puddle Walk</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_01_24-16-Pirbright.jpg</src><caption>Pirbright Sunset</caption></image>

		<p>Yes I know how to spell 'son'. This is a story that came back from playschool today.</p><p>The playschool teacher was talking about planets to the whole group and naming each one, and said 'and the largest planet of all is the sun'. At which point Ben piped up and said 'No, No, the sun is a star, not a planet', at which point all the teachers just started cracking up.</p><woops woopstitle="Leave keys in motorbike ignition for 2 days at busy carpark!" rating="4"><p>Daddy has been in Manchester for the past 2 days installing his new web application at Greater Manchester Police. Anyway he rode his motorbike and parked at Farnborough Main railway station on Monday morning. On the way home today, Daddy couldn't find his motorbike keys. Looked in pockets and bags, everywhere. Oh know he might have left them on the bike! Convinced that the bike would be stolen, the train pulled up back into Farnborough station and the bike was still there!!! First glanced at the top box, nothing there... the ignition, keys there!!! The motorbike had been sitting in the carpark for 36 hours with the keys in the ignition. Not exactly unnoticable. Daddy laughed.</p></woops>

		<woops woopstitle="Slammed motorbike into a stationary car at 30mph" rating="6"><p>For the second time in 6 days Daddy had another motorbike accident. This time it was his fault. He crash into a stationary car on he main Deepcut road. The car was waiting to turn right, and Daddy hadn't noticed he'd stopped and went into the back of him at 30mph!! Ouch. Daddy flung forward and crushed his bits against the petrol tank and ended up on the floor again, this time quite winded. Again shockingly there was next to no damage caused. The chap got out of his car and wasn't best pleased even though there was no damage. It took about 30 mins to get rid of the winding and a few days for the crushing pain to go away!</p></woops>

When I took him to the toilet he was telling me that 2 and 2 made 4 (fantastic). Ben alwats chats much more when he is in the toilets and number seem to be the main topic. Oliver joined us in the toilets and the boys helf a long conversation about what number the toilet they had used. They both became very animated and giggley which was great to see.</p><p>Author: Tracey (Ben's playschool teacher)</p>

    <info>
		<p>In the morning Daddy popped out for his haircut whilst the rest of us were sorting stuff out from the loft and preparing for another house viewing.</p><p>It was lunchtime and we went to the Arena to attend Freya's 4th Birthday party. First up the bouncey castle assualt course. Ben and Katie are so sweet together. They waited for each other and even held hands as they ran round for another go! Jessica enjoyed the freedom to run around lots as well. We happened to bump into Lorraine as well, our old next door neighbour.</p><p>We moved onto some play apparatus and built a little house together until some nasty boys came and bashed it down. Ben was a hit with one of the helper ladies! Jessica was in heaven. So many things to climb up.</p><p>The third stage was in a dance hall where party food was served as well as the cake presentation.</p><p>We were then invited with some family back to the West ranch, where Daddy and Uncle Barrie rolled back the years and played football in the back garden. They both kicked the ball over the fence! Ben was fascinated at Barrie's Star Wars collection and one of the other boys introduced him to the Clone Wars series. Katie was loving the huge trampoline in the back garden.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_01_31-05-Freya4thBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Freeeedom</caption></image>

    <title>Joey's Swimming Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>After church and Jessica weighing in with a 3 hour morning sleep, we headed to Woking for Joey's birthday swim. The talk was of which flumes we'll be attempting. Mummy and Daddy have heard it all before. When push comes to shove, Ben and Katie generally chicken out!</p><p>We had a bit of a scare as Ben wandered off and we spent 5 minutes looking for him. He was found looping around the lazy river! Thank goodness he was fine. Mummy kept cuddling Ben and making sure he was OK and making sure he knew we all loved him. Eventually he got fed up with this and told Mummy 'Let's stop talking about this now Mummy!' Brilliant.</p><p>We had a good time with Ben and Katie keeping their word. Ben was brave enough to go down the black flume lots of times, Katie the slow green flume. They all love the water, even Jessica enjoys herself. Woking pool is just ideal for the three of them. It offers so much.</p><p>We sang happy birthday to Joey in the restaurant and gave him presents. He got a game called Magic Carpet and an American Football top from us.</p>

		<p>We decided to go down to Hayling Island today. It was sunny if a little chilly. We hit the seafront and first visited the fun fair. Ben and Katie went on a car ride then up the Helter Skelter, Katie came down, Ben didn't. Where was he? Who knows. Mummy in the end had to go up and give him a shove. Jessica looked on jealously. They both came down luge style.... flat on their back. Not sure who made that up.</p><p>Around to the beach railway and we sat and had our picnic on the station. The train trundelled in and we sat right at the front behind the engine. It was a dirty diesel! It was a long old journey, finally ending up by a playground in the Eastoke area. After a play in the sandy playground, we went to the stoney beach and threw stones into the water. Ben almost accidently threw one at Katie's head! We almost got caught out with the incoming tide!</p><p>Down to the exercise area. It was funny to see mummy do the step up, step down exercise. Then Jessica put her finger in some dog poo, so we all returned back to the station and toliets to refresh. We caught the returning train to the fairground and had one last go on the daring wulitzer type ride. Well it circled around, each car spun on it's own axis and went up and down. Ben especially got to love it.</p><p>One final go in another playground, before time, coldness and tiredness caught up with us. We left Ben's coat in the playground!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_02_14-00-HaylingIsland.jpg</src><caption>Hayling Island</caption></image>

    <title>London Aquarium with Fars, TriLakes and Swimming</title>
    <info>
		<p>Jette and I are pooped! We have been entertaining Katie and Ben since eleven o'clock and although they are as good as gold, it is still a wearing experience. It began with us going round to Deepcut to collect the youngsters and drive to Brookwood for the train to London. We caught the 11.48am  for Waterloo which, on a Sunday, was not the quickest train up to the capital and was well filled. However, we found a nice corner in a first class section of the train after speaking with the train's conductor.</p><p>We left the train at Clapham Junction and wandered round the corner through a very busy shopping area, considering it was a Sunday, and boarded a number 77 bus which, by coincidence, also had Waterloo as its final destination. We quickly stamped upstairs where both children were fully occupied for the 20 minutes journey through less well heeled suburbs of Battersea and Vauxhall before alighting on the grey but fairly pleasant day for a short walk past the London Eye to the London Aquarium.</p><p>I can recall that little stretch of the South Bank of the Thames being quite a sterile run when the building there housed only the city's municipal administration but now is a fully commercial edifice. There are a number of exhibitions and general opportunities to relive cash from your pocket. Fortunately, we unknowingly picked a day when there was a special promotion whereby children entered free of charge. With entry and all travel, we had only spent £16.50, but of course we did not entirely 'escape.'</p><p>Our pockets felt a lot lighter after a snack in the cafe there, a face painting session and the shop at the exit but we could not really complain. A very light drizzle had started up but the time we departed just after four and the painted faces were under threat in the damp, but survived. We had a little time to waste and Ben, in particular, found great delight in travelling up and down a set of escalators.</p><p>The train comfortably took us back to Brookwood by which time it was almost dark. We stopped off at Frimley Green to me to buy some bits and pieces to provide for a much requester treasure hunt; some sweets, balloons, magazine and piggy bank change. So by the time Jette rustled up a meal, dominated by sautéed potatoes, baked beans, fruit jelly and ice cream and a bath that finally saw the demise of the now well smudged facial artworks, it was eight o'clock by the time they had a shortened bedtime story and lights out.</p><p>Oh, I also had to give a short tour of the water pipes! It seemed that they were both a bit upset the last time they were here by the strange house noises at night, The clunking and creaking that occurs in most homes. They have the same concerns when staying at Laura's parents' home. I explained how the water came into the house and through the boiler to be heated up and then be distributed through pipes to the radiators and how the differing changes of temperature causes noise from time to time in the hope that taking the mysticism out of it all.</p><p>It is now approaching 11.30pm and, so far, there has not been a peep out of them. let's hope it stays like that until we get them back to Deepcut tomorrow morning when they can raise hell if they want!</p><p>Author: Farfar</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_02_15-03-LondonAquarium.jpg</src><caption>Fish Tank Face</caption></image><p>Meanwhile Mummy and Daddy were finally able to spend some quality time with Jessica. We went over to Trilakes to visit the farm animals and walk around the lake, then onto the swimming.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_02_15-07-TriLakes.jpg</src><caption>Daddy and Jess enjoying the walk</caption></image><p>Later in the afternoon Karen and Richard popped over to watch Man Utd vs Derby in the F.A Cup.</p>

    <title>Drusilla's</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        Daddy had the half term week off work, and he had planned a surprise trip down to
        <a href="http://www.drusillas.co.uk/">
          Drusilla's
        </a>
        . It's a small zoo, come massive adventure playground, ideal for a 1, 3 and 5 year old. We particularly enjoyed competing against each other in the zoo olympics. Our favourite was 'How loud are you?' Here a person would go into an old style telephone box and shout, scream, make as much noise as possible. Ben attained the highest figure of 112 decibels. He even beat mummy and daddy's best efforts!
      </p><p>We also tried sprints, hopping, stretching, seeing. All great fun for the kiddies. Jessica was fascintated with some of the monkey's. Probably because she feels some afinity with them, being one herself! After an early lunch, we went onto the packed, huge adventure playground. Loads of rope bridges, slides, swings, outposts. We lost the children a couple of times in the maze of apparatus. That burnt off some energy.</p><p>We then split. Katie decided she wanted to sift for gold. However, we didn't get an apron on her in time and she managed to soak the sleeves of her top, trousers and shoes. Nevermind. Benny went down the big inflatable slide with the playschool teddy, which we had to get photos of and show next week. 'We' then somehow managed to lose this teddy, despite our best efforts of looking for him. Daddy is glad he has not got to tell playschool.</p><p>One of the attractions was Thomas The Tank Engine railway. We queued and boarded the train which ran around the perimeter of the park. We ended the day by double backing through the park to see all the animals again quickly. It was quite refreshing as there were no crowds. The children thoroughly enjoyed it.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_02_18-00-Drusillas.jpg</src><caption>Drusilla Action</caption></image><p>Time was marching on and we had to find our hotel and something to eat. A fish and chip meal in our room just outside Hailsham. All five of us managed to settle down and get a reasonable night's kip.</p>

    <info>
		<p>We headed into Eastbourne, first stopping off at a Sainsbury's Cafe for a spot of breakfast. Jessica managed to pebble dash the cafe floor in a nice blend of Rice Krispies!</p><p>We embarrassingly slinked out and headed to the seafront. The weather wasn't as good as yesterday but the kiddies were on fire. Dancing, singing and skipping down the promenade. We had a nice long walk along the beach from the pier to blow the cobwebs out.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_02_19-02-Eastbourne.jpg</src><caption>The happy crew</caption></image><p>We then tried to get in the local swimming pool, but were told that we needed a 1:1 ratio for the children. Apparently it is the law for flumed pools. This upset Ben in particular who loooooves flumes.</p><p>We instead headed towards Beachy Head and went for another long walk up a big hill. We could see the sea all around. Daddy reckoned there was a mini-tornado out to sea. We later returned to the car and made our way slowly home.</p>

    <title>Gay Heritage Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>Myself, Mum and Dad went up to London for two reasons. Mum wanted to go and see Portabello Road market which we did briefly. After a knockout Sausage And Mash under the A4, we headed on for leg two which was to look up some old Gay residence.</p><p>
        After a slow painful bus, tube and walk we attempted to find
        <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;t=h&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.545214,-0.120485&amp;spn=0.010716,0.021887&amp;z=16&amp;msid=111027506527990496626.00046380e4a35769a792a">
          Nailor Street
        </a>
        where William Gay lived with his daughter's family, Susannah at the age of 70. This was a less than impressive venue being situated directly opposite Pentonville prison on the Caledonian Road. The house and road no longer existed. After talking to some local old dears, the houses were demolished because they didn't have bathrooms inside! The site now was an Islington council estate. The houses weren't particularly big or nice. Disapointing not to actually to see the original street or house.
      </p><p>
        We marched on eastwards towards Highbury, for street number 2,
        <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.54803,-0.08568&amp;spn=0.010715,0.021887&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;msid=111027506527990496626.00046387abd1302fe2ec4">
          Mildmay Street
        </a>
        , N1. Not too sure who lived here, but again another house that hasn't survived, and now an Islington council estate.
      </p><p>
        Next stop was
        <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.542892,-0.077999&amp;spn=0.010716,0.021887&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;msid=111027506527990496626.00046387abd1302fe2ec4">
          Hertford Road
        </a>
        which was Auntie Grace's family home when a child in the early part of the 20th century. A nice street and at last an actual house to see on the edge of another council estate in Dalston.
      </p><p>
        A short trip across the Regents Canal to the desirable Hoxton, saw our original William Gay residence from the mid 19th century. 9 Whitmore Street and
        <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.536813,-0.086058&amp;spn=0.010718,0.021887&amp;t=h&amp;z=16&amp;msid=111027506527990496626.0004639c0f654192e68da">
          77 Felton Street
        </a>
        could be one in the same place. Whitmore Street no longer exists and Felton Street has been trimmed in length, again it is now another council estate of flats, which didn't look great. Not sure why, but I do find it interesting to see the areas where my ancestors lived. I'm an east end boy!

    <title>Bank To South Bank</title>
    <info>
		<p>A sunny day welcomed us so we decided to go to London. We went to Turnham Green as usual and caught the tube to Bank. Benny was entertaining the customers on the underground with his infectious cackle. Hard to put into words, but he was a jolly old soul.</p><p>We walked down from Bank to Monument which is one of our favourite old haunts. It has been shut for the past year for refurbishment. We lost count of the number steps we had to climb. Katie was the only one who reached the top unaided. Finally at the top we could see for miles. We received our certificates on the way out and headed for the river.</p><p>Jessica fell asleep, and Katie and Ben let us know in their style that they needed refuelling! So we stopped at a bench by the Millenium Bridge. We wished it still was 'wibbley wobbley'. Mummy had 'he-cups' (hicups) according to Ben!</p><p>
        Ben was continuing to be on top, top form making passers by smile with his laugh and expressions. Ben and Katie were in their element. Whilst mummy and Jessica stopped for lunch, Katie, Ben and Daddy went on the beach and also played on some wooden toys at
        <a href="http://www.coinstreet.org/gabriels_wharf.aspx">
          Gabriel's Wharf
        </a>
        .
      </p><p>We continued past the skateboarders under Festival Hall and onto the street performers by the London Eye. Katie was scared of the double jointed performers who managed to turn themselves inside out it would seem. We also saw Darth Vader. I think Ben was a bit star struck.... then Jessica didn't know what to make of the 'tin man' with extendable arms!</p><p>We of course couldn't end our tour without a go on the playground and a bus journey from Westminster back to Hamersmith, then tubed it back to the car. Katie and Ben really enjoyed themselves, they were a delight to be with today.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_03_07-00-LondonMonumentSouthBank.jpg</src><caption>London Stroll</caption></image><p>Later we watched a MC Hammer dance on TV. Ben tried to do some break dancing to it in his brown and pink dress! He ended crying as he squashed his nose attempting a special move!!</p>

    <title>Ben Falls Into The River Itchen</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ben is well into what clothes he wears. He has so many t-shirts he likes. He often cannot decide so wears all of them. During the week he had 7 t-shirts on!</p><p>
        Today we picked out another walk from Uncle Steven's book. And today's lucky winner was a trip down to Winchester. We parked up and began to walk through the town passing the impressive
        <a href="http://www.winchester-cathedral.org.uk/history/">
          cathedral
        </a>
        and posh collage.
      </p><woops woopstitle="Ben falls into river" rating="6"><p>The Itchen awaited us. Ben and Katie loved walking along, playing around near the bank, pretending to fish. About a mile or so into the walk all of a sudden we hear a splash. Ben has stumbled in and is up to his neck in water. Luckily we were able to drag him out, but he was soaked and muddy from neck to toe! He was not a happy bunny. We had to strip him and mummy and daddy gave up some clothes to stop him from getting cold. He had to sit in Jessica's seat where there was the cosi-toes to keep his legs warm. He looked every so grumpy in the pushchair. Like an old granny.</p></woops><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_03_14-12-Winchester.jpg</src><caption>Winchester</caption></image><p>This ended our trek, we turned and returned to the car and home.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Wests were going to come around, however, Freya was sick. Instead Daddy and Jessica went for a nice bike ride in the woods at Pirbright. Although it is only 5 minutes down the road, a largely unexplored area. On our relatively short ride, we managed to see: a goods train, some good mountain bike runs, loads of troops and army trucks, some horses, cows, a buffalo (in joke) and even a dear. We also saw Guildford cathedral in the distance. A real nice ride.</p><p>In the evening Daddy went with the Gay's to the opening of the refurbished Chertsey Town F.C. clubhouse for a race night.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_03_14-07-PirbrightHeath.jpg</src><caption>Pirbright Landscape</caption></image>

		<p>Today Mummy was treated to two concerts. The first was at Ben's pre-school and he sang three lovely songs, one about a bath and bubbles and one about being good because its Mothers Day. He looked gorgeous and Mummy cried. The second in the afternoon at Cross Farm with Katie's lovely singing. Mummy got there early to baggsy a front row seat and Katie sat right in front of me. There was lots of singing and a poem called "O.k Mummy dear" which was very funny. After the children invited the Mummies for tea and cakes.</p>

    <title>Brixton, Brick Lane, Drusillas</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today Ma Ma and Pop Pop took Katie and Ben for a special treat. Asked where they most liked to go, Drusilla's was the response even though we'd only gone there 4 weeks ago!! I think the lure of that amazing adventure playground was too much for them.</p><p>After dropping off the merchandise at the Star in Leatherhead, Mummy, Daddy and Jessica made their way to Brixton. Finally we found somewhere to park for free and we walked into the markets on Electric street. There were many butchers and fishmongers all run by the ethnics and even a couple of different people on their soap box which is good to see. Always makes me laugh because I never know if anyone actually listens to them. Any excuse to hear the West Indian accent though!</p><p>Our walk continued westwards past where our Great Granny (Doris Rosa) was born, 54 Sandmere Road. It was a nice house in a nice street, which is a bit of change to normal. We don't know whether she actaully lived there or not. It seems a bit out of the area. The family came from north of the river in the Marylebone area.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_03_21-02-54SandmereRoadBrixton.jpg</src><caption>54 Sandmere Road, Brixton. Great Granny was born here</caption></image><p>We caught the tube from Clapham North up to Moorgate. We disembarked and made our way past Liverpool Street Station, where there were lots of police and celery singing football supporters! So funny because there was a greengrocers next to them and he was fast running out of celery!! Celery, Celery, If She Dont Come...... that song.</p><p>We made it to the edge of Spitalfields market where we stopped for a flask of tea and for Jessica's lunch. It would appear that we were too late for the actual market, so we didn't explore in the regenerated building. Save that for another time. Instead we continued to Brick Lane. A place where none of us hadn't been before. It was full of Indian and Banglideshi restaurants mainly. Restaurant after restaurant. Now here highlights Daddy's lack of Indian knowledge. 'So what would you like?'.... 'Just a vegetable Balti' .... 'Just one vegetable please Gupta'. Low and behold that's what we got. Apparently it is implied that you get / order rice with that. Oh well, Mummy suggested it was like eating bolognese sause without the mince! Ah well.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_03_21-11-BrixtonBrickLane.jpg</src><caption>Spitalfields Walk</caption></image><p>We continued northwards right to the end of Brick Lane. It had a similar feel as Camden. A young persons area, as the Fars would say.</p><p>
        Next stop was <a href="http://www.spitalfieldscityfarm.org/">Spitalfields City Farm</a>. Our speciality visting these city farms. We were greeted by a special needs chap who came sprinting up to open the gate for us! First stop was to see Farfar. aka Itchy The Pig. We saw him being fed. Couldn't see his eyes but Jessica certainly got a good view of his teeth. Urrgghh. His eating manners were akin some monkies that I know!
      </p><p>Jessica absolutely loved the farm. As time was passing she was getting more confident with them. She stayed along time with the goats. Even tried to say 'Goats'. We went in the with the gineau pigs and chickens and even tried to stroke a rabbit, although her arm was forced by Daddy.</p><p>We finished up after a couple of hours with another flask of tea in the nearby park, before walking to where the Allard's used to live, near Old Street tube, back in the middle of the nineteenth century. This was a bit more like it. A nothing street with conncil flats! Mummy wants to see where her London based relatives used to live.</p><p>We returned back to the car and home after a lovely day out with our Jessica.</p>

    <title>Urban Rebound onto the floor!</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy is trying to get a little fitter, so for the second week she attended the Urban Rebound. This week she dragged Daddy along as well.</p><woops woopstitle="Falling off trampoline" rating="2"><p>The Urban Rebound class included 25 or so others who all enjoyed bouncing up and down on a trampoline. For Daddy it was the first time..... and it showed. He concentrated so hard at keeping on the damm thing he didn't focus on the instructor who barked out the next moves.</p><p>Anyway Daddy fell off! The noise echoing around the sports hall and people looking around as they were still bouncing, with a look of disgust at him. All Daddy could do is laugh and get back on, this time with double concentration. He knows what it is like to have big feet!</p></woops>

    <title>10 Year Engagement Anniversary, Daddy at Playschool</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ten years ago, Mummy and Daddy got engaged in New York! Wow that seems such a long time ago. Since then they have got married, bought two houses and had us three children.</p><p>Benny has been excited about Daddy coming into play at playschool. I'm not too sure if the teachers were thrilled, especially after he got the chikdren into such a frenzy the chief teacher had to ring the bell to calm all the children down. All he was doing was trying to play hide and seek. More and more children wanted to join in!</p><p>It was quite interesting to see what goes on. It was organised in structured sessions. There was sharing time, eating time and story and singing time. In between each of these was play time, and some group work. Ben doesn't mix in with the other children that much. If Oliver Strangle was there it might be a different story. Anyway Daddy noticed how fickle Ben is. Normally it is Mummy to serve all his needs, but with some additional playtime and attention from Daddy it all changes. Daddy felt good that Ben enjoyed the company.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_03_27-06-MartinPlayschool.jpg</src><caption>Playschool buddies</caption></image>

    <title>Easter Hunt - Ham House, Weston's Over</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went to Ham House for an Easter trail. We had such trouble finding it Katie said Mummy was the worst map reader ever although as Mummy pointed out Katie was the one in the front holding the map and therefore she was the map reader, Mummy just the driver. Ben suggested we get a lady in a box who tells you the way like Pop Pop has (Sat. Nav). Apparently she lives in there. We stopped at a bakers for lunch and eventually arrived and did the trail. There was photos of things around the house and garden and we had to find them. It was great fun. We found most things Katie ticking them off on her clipboard. We won some lettuce seeds which we will plant.</p><p>On the way home we found a smashing park which Ben described as the best one ever and we had great fun. Ma Ma, Pop Pop and Uncle Peter came and bought fish and Chips!</p>

    <title>Ballet Exam - Swimming</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie had a ballet exam in the morning. She said she had done alright, but we will not know. It is such a shame as Daddy has never seen Katie actually ballet yet. Parents are not allowed to watch as it is said to distract the chidren too much.</p><p>In the afternoon we went over to the swimming baths at Wokingham. Katie showed how good and confident she is swimming in the water. She could consistently swim 15 metres which is very impressive. She also loved going down the long slide on her own.</p>

    <title>Frimley Park 10km Run - Sanders Sunday Lunch</title>
    <info>
		<p>A bright morning saw Daddy, Richard and Jon compete in the Frimley Park 10km. The girls wimped out with excuses ranging from being pregnant to wanting a lie in bed! Daddy had plenty of support all around the course. Mummy and us high fived Daddy and some of the other runners by the Esso garage. Rob May and Pauline Worrall were out there, along with the Fars on their bicycle. Karen and Rachel also cheered us on. There were a few hills on this course which might explain a slightly slower time than Littlehampton. Daddy's fitness coach, Barrie did encourage the beer Daddy had the day before! Also, Daddy ran last week and it took him 1hr 15mins, so knocking 20 mins off that was a good achievement.</p><p>We then scooted around to the Sanders for a lovelllly Sunday Roast. What a spread. We then went to the swings where Uncle Richard pushed Ben off the swing, and kicked the ball in Katie's face from about a yard away! Is this man fit to father a child? We had a great afternoon.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_04_05-11-SandersLunch.jpg</src><caption>Katie enjoying the playground</caption></image>

It was great fun going on the long slide. It was funny as Katie noticed that she could see Farfar's bottom!... and sheepishly mentioned it to Farmor. Farfar had a builders bottom going on!</p>

		<p>We went over to Pangbourne to do the village Easter trail. We picked up our sheet and had to look for 30 posters each in different shop windows around the village, and then solve the anagram. It was fun trying to spot where the posters were. We found all 30 and received a chocolate bunny rabbit as a prize. We then went over to the swings by the river.</p><p>In the afternoon Daddy went to watch Chertsey play in an important match, whilst the rest of us did craft at home.</p>

Infact it pierced Howard's waterproof jacket which had his expensive phone in. The phone didn't survive. Still at least we got the expensive bit out of the way, to go on top of the GPS system and pillion seat (still not rectified) from previous trips! We soildered on, hit Wales then took refuge in the Elder mansion in Penarth, where we warmed up, dryed out and had some teas and food. Michael looked as if he were ready to stay, getting comfy in Mama Elder's slippers and endless cups of teas!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_04_17-02-Day1-HomeToAberystwyth.jpg</src><caption>The biker boys</caption></image><p>The weather cleared a bit so we headed north through the Brecon Beacons. The heavens opened once more so unfortunately not much sight seeing, however, it did mean more tea drinking! We made it through the muddy roads to Aberystwyth where the sun shone for the first time. After Howard's attempts at putting us up in a crack house for the night, we eventually found a nice guest house overlooking the seafront. 'Aber' as the locals call it, looked really good at night time, especially with the big cliff/rock to the north of town, illuminated with a green light. It was spooky.</p><p>We spent th evening in a chippy then onto the pier to sink a couple of beers. Opened the window to our room and slept to the sound of the crashing waves!

          ROUTE
        </a></p><p>We awoke to sunshine. Yes. Where we really begin to enjoy our trip. I had to see the castle in 'Aber', so we circled this and the endless one way system and headed east out of town. We soon hit some scenary. What struck me was how lush the grass looked. Just fancied lying in one of the fields and do a spot of relaxing under the sun. However, Devil's Bridge was next stop.... and what a let down. Without paying the £3.50 we saw nothing. So we promptly took the scenic route to Rhayader which was just fantastic. The boys, who were more interested in the racing aspect of the journey, left me way behind as I poodled along enjoying the Elan valley. Fantastic.</p><p>We stopped for tea and after having a bit of trouble (as Frank Spencer would say) with Jon's bike we continued north. Now this is where not sticking together got us into a spot of bother. Basically we lost Howard, and I hate to think of the speeds attained in trying to find one another. Just as we were resigned on not seeing Howard for a long time we stopped off at a supermarket for supplies. Michael then happened to see Howard down the bottom of the road. He quickly sprinted onto his bike and chased him down!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_04_18-16-Day2-AberystwythToWelshpool.jpg</src><caption>Wales wouldn't be Wales without the sheep</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_04_18-17-Day2-AberystwythToWelshpool.jpg</src><caption>Spooky trees</caption></image><p>We then had some really nice tarmac, weather and scenary on the journey to Machynlleth. Probably as a group voted as best 20 mile stretch on our tour. A pattern was begining to appear. Michael and Howard playing silly buggers up front. Myself and Jon trying to cling onto the road miles behind.</p><p>Machynlleth was lunchtime and the town much like every other. Really nice character buildings and atmosphere to boot. We moved on and continued north through Dolgellau and up to Trawsfynydd where Jon and I almost had a coming together on the bikes. Totally my fault. I was overtaking Michael, but hadn't mirrored or signalled.... just manouvred! Jon had the same idea. Anyway it's on YouTube if you want to see. Howard broke the land speed record again, much to the annoyance of an oncomming cyclist.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_04_18-24-Day2-AberystwythToWelshpool.jpg</src><caption>Boys cruising to Dolgellau</caption></image><p>We turned onto a side road and continued along past mountains and lakes. Very picturesque and the weather was still great. Low on petrol we limped into Bala and filled up, before hurrying again onto Welshpool.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_04_18-34-Day2-AberystwythToWelshpool.jpg</src><caption>Enjoying the views at Capel Celyn</caption></image><p>Howard dropped his bike in town!.. and then 5 minutes later, when the engine was no longer flooded, he almost dropped it once more! Doughnut. We stayed at an elderly man's B&amp;B next to a pub. We watch some of the FA Cup semi final in the pub before moving into town for an Indian.... The boys ribbed me with my scampi and chips! Typically Indian right? It was freezing cold, didn't stay in town long and returned home for a bit of poker.</p>

    <title>Wales Motorbike Holiday - Welshpool to home</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        Today's
        <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&amp;source=s_d&amp;saddr=Welshpool&amp;daddr=A483%2FNew+Rd+to:52.48738,-3.34671+to:Unknown+road+to:A40+to:A40+to:Unknown+road+to:Frimley&amp;geocode=%3BFWhLIQMdxnHN_w%3B%3BFRrMGwMdahXM_w%3BFcj1FgMdkgvR_w%3BFZ6OFgMdLJ7W_w%3BFSRkFQMdCAPX_w%3B&amp;hl=en&amp;mra=dpe&amp;mrcr=0&amp;mrsp=2&amp;sz=12&amp;via=1,2,3,4,5&amp;sll=52.471697,-3.175392&amp;sspn=0.205372,0.528717&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=52.010246,-2.101135&amp;spn=1.660184,4.229736&amp;z=9">
          ROUTE
        </a></p><p>
        We awoke and watched a bit of the Chinese Grand Prix. We had a big breakfast on small plates. After getting Jon's bike started we began our way south and homeward bound. We still had some top roads to ride, which included the prize Newtown to Crossgates. Tarmac heaven with very little traffic. I managed to tag onto a Hells Angels group called the
        <a href="http://www.patriotsmc.co.uk/Club%20History.htm">
          Patriots
        </a>
        . They even had club, biker, leather jackets!
      </p><p>We stopped in the sleepy Buith Wells for some more latte, before pushing on past Abergeveny, which hosted some VFR event, so Michael proudly told us, onto Monmouth where we stopped again for lunch. Another interesting town centre.</p><p>Then we had some fun down to Chepstow. A Wheelie from Howard, and a drag race won by Michael over Howard as well, which caused a stir. Howard staunchly defending his top dog status giving the excuse of missing 2nd gear! Michael wasn't having any of it.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_04_19-05-Day3-WelshpoolToHome.jpg</src><caption>Tintern Abbey</caption></image><p>It was then a leisurely ride back home over the second Severn bridge. A really nice time had by all. Cheers chaps.</p>

    <title>The Teales</title>
    <info>
		<p>Last Friday, we drove to Gravesend and after calling in to see Summer and Alice for lunch we went to Ma ma and Pop Pops. Joey and Lily were already there. We had tea and then staggered baths as 5 no longer fit, the older ones took it in turns to cycle Joey's bike round the block. Much to Lily's absolute disgust Jessie pooed in their bath and it had to be abandoned early!!</p>

    <title>Vasarki</title>
    <info>
		<p>Last Saturday, an early start 06:15, thanks to Jessie! Ma Ma's school was taking part in an Indain celebration called Vasarki which was a bit like a carnival, with lorries and a procession through Gravesend high street. Katie walked with Ma ma in it. Mummy, Ben, Jessie and Pop Pop watched. It was very colourful with lots of Bangra music which Mummy loves. Katie got given lots of crisps, drinks and sweets as it is the Indian celebration of Harvest.</p><p>After this we went to Eltham church to try and find some gravestones of relatives as Mummy is starting to look at the Weston family tree. We found three names. After briefly stopping at Bluewater we went back to Ma ma and Pop Pops for more rides round the block and tea and bath. Lily gave Jessie strict instuctions not to poo in the bath.</p>

    <title>Godstone Farm</title>
    <info>
		<p>Last Sunday, another early start 6:30. We went to church, the five were really noisy and disruptive. Pop Pop went and disowned us and sat at the other side of the church. We then drove to Godstone farm for a picnic. It was so sunny and the kids had a great time. We met with Felicity and Fraser. Katie and Felicity seem to really like each other. We saw some animals which Jessie loved, except the noisy cow, but most of the time was spent on all the adventure playgrounds. We had an ice cream and didn't leave until it shut as there was so much to do. I think we wore out Ma Ma and Pop Pop enough!</p>

    <first name="benjamin">Ben Football Training</first>
    <info>
		<p>Ben went to Frimley Green rec for his first hour's football training session. He listened to the trainer intently, dressed in his favourite Denmark kit!</p><p>Down to business, skills up first. Dribbling, wasn't sure to laugh or cry as he fell over the ball. He didn't quite get the kicking the ball out of the hand. Down to the game, and he ran, not always in the right direction, but he did run. All in all he really enjoyed, it'll be really good to be involved in a team game and an excuse to run about.</p><p>Katie loved watching so much so, she now wants to sign up.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_04_22-03-BenFirstFootballLesson.jpg</src><caption>Ben at Football Training</caption></image>

		<p>Back to Gravesend again. Mummy picked up Katie from school and we drove straight there. We all had bikes this time to cycle round the block. Mummy had trouble getting us all off to sleep, Jessie in particular, as we all slept in one room.</p>

    <title>Herne Bay and Chelmsford</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we drove to Herne Bay to check out a campsite for the Summer holiday. It looks really nice. We were impressed by the swing park there. Then we drove to the seafront had a coffee, bought a picnic in the bakers and sat and ate it on the beach.  We threw stones in the sea. Jessie and Ben loved doing this. We then had a slightly stressful trip round Sainsbury's to do Ma ma and Pop Pop's shopping. Ma Ma bought Katie some new clothes though.</p><p>In the evening we drove to Chelmsford to meet Auntie Christine and Steve for tea at a pub. There weas a softplay attached and the kids had a great time in there while we waited for our food. By the time we left the children were exhausted so we thought we would get a lie in the next day but no 06:30 Ben this time.</p>

    <title>Swanley Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>We decided against taking all the children to church after last week, so just Mummy, Jessie and Pop Pop went and she was as good as gold. We then went to Swanley park for a picnic. We got the miniture train over to the swings, had a paddle in the paddling pool, a play in the sandpit and an ice cream. Jessie and Katie loved the paddling pool, going in naked and the water was freezing, although the weather was very warm. When we got home, Katie cycled while Mummy jogged and we went 3.5 times round the block with Katie encouraging Mummy all the way she is so sweet.</p><p>It was Farmors birthday, so the Fars made a late, brief appearance. We sang happy birthday and gave her cards and presents. We also played Top Trumps with her!</p>

    <title>Ben And Abba</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today at playschool, the teacher asked if anyone would like to stand up and sing a song. Adam first stood up and sang 'Baa Baa Black Sheep'.</p><p>Ben then stood up and sang from start to finish, Abba's Mama Mia. The playschool teachers were wetting themselves with laughter. I only wish it was videoed.</p><p>The other day Ben came into the kitchen crying. He said 'Look mummy I've got tear rolling down my cheeks'. Mummy concerned at first, then realized it was because he was so touched on the film 'Mama Mia' which he was watching!</p><p>Ben is very much into his music and clothes. In the morning the first thing he does is pretty much empty his drawers deciding what to wear. Quite often he'll wear a number of t-shirts and change his trousers just because he likes so many of them.</p><p>On the music front, Ben is the main dude deciding what radio station to have on. He loves 'Daddy and Benny' music. Quite often whilst driving, he'll peer over to Daddy, look intently, and then copies Daddies head bopping moves! So sweet. He loves Drums and Guitar. Good Boy!</p>

    <title>Surrey Heath Show</title>
    <info>
		<p>This year Mummy has been working very hard preparing for the Surrey Heath Show as she was managing the Playschool stall. It was to sell cakes and a Teddy Tombola all of which were donated by the parents of the playschool.</p><p>Mummy went down early to setup the stall, then we all went down at midday and help out and to roam around going on some of the fairground rides, watching the main display area where there was some dancing and the general stuff at a show.</p><p>Jessica toddled up to a little merry-go-round all excited and tried to get on it as it was moving. We waited our turn, popped Jessica on, she loved it for about 3 revolutions and then burst out crying for some reason. The ride had to be stopped! Funny girl.</p><p>Farmor came along for a bit, as did most of the Elders minus Ellie. In the end we raised £128 and spread the good word of the playschool.</p><p>In the evening Mummy and Daddy went around to Auntie Karen and Richards for a BBQ. Main topic of conversation was how bad Daddy's packed lunches are.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_02-25-SurreyHeathFair.jpg</src><caption>Our Stall</caption></image>

    <title>Meet Up With The Dixons</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today we went down to Deal to meet up with the whole Dixon clan. There were two new additions to the family since we last saw them. Reuben is now 7 months old and a big chap. He was such a good boy through out the day. Adam is just a couple of months old and so small and cute. Amazingly Mummy didn't walk away wanting more babbies. I think she has learnt her lesson and we've got more than enough.</p><p>All the crew were well and happy. Linda was retiring next week and plans to have some 'Linda' time which Daddy is very envious of. Daddy can't wait till retirement age! David and Lisa have recently move to a larger house so all good there.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_03-07-Dixons.jpg</src><caption>Reuben in Alan's capable</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_03-10-Dixons.jpg</src><caption>Adam, Yasmin and Alan</caption></image><p>It was nice to see Katie and Ben being mummy and daddy with their child, Yasmin. Katie was reading her a bedtime story. Ben couldn't distinguish between the name Yasmin and Jasmin (of the Disney princess fame).</p><p>We had a picnic in the backgarden and was on edge everytime a youngster went near the pond. It was good to see everyone and we departed with David, Lisa, Yasmin and Reuben for Joss Bay near Broadstairs.</p><p>Joss Bay was great. It had a sandy beach, the water was a little too cold to go swimming, however, we made the long trip to fetch water for our sand castles and holes which we were digging.</p><p>Next up was a trip down to the rocks where we all looked for crabs. We worringly don't know if some of them were dead before picking them out of the water. However, we did eventually find a live one, although it had some legs missing!</p><p>Jessica was wandering all over the place, invading peoples areas. She is a nosey parker. She also enjoyed putting her head literally in sand! Emerging with snot and sand stuck to her face. Urrghh.</p><p>We ended with a game of football. Lisa played well in goal, Ben regularly missing the 4 foot wide goal from about a yard out! He's obviously inherited Daddy's right foot!</p><p>Thanks to the Dixons for a lovely day.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_03-17-Dixons.jpg</src><caption>Lisa and Jessica sharing a moment</caption></image>

    <info>
		<p>After the excesses over the last couple of days, we spent the bank holiday pottering around the house playing games and doing jobs.</p><p>In the afternoon we popped over to see Susan and Graham as we hadn't seen them for a while. Ben was trying to get the hang of the Star Wars game on the computer, whilst Jessica was teasing herself by seeing how close she could get to Bomber or Muriel before screeching!</p><p>We did our customary walk around the block, playing on the swings and attempting to feed the overfed ducks!</p>

    <title>Phil's Wedding Golf Day - Charlotte and Michael birthday meal</title>
    <info>
		<p>Phil having got married yesterday was funding a golf day at Mapledurham, which was on the other side of Reading. Seeing that all the other players were coming from hotels locally, I had a bit of a problem in terms of getting my golf clubs to the course. I ended up bungee straping them to the back of the bike</p><p>The journey made all the more hazardous by putting the clubs on the wrong side of the bike and of course it started raining! Anyway there was only just one incident, where a car almost hit my clubs on the A322!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_08-03-PhilGolf.jpg</src><caption>Golfing motorbike styley</caption></image><p>We had a nice lunch and a survivors pack which included some food and whiskey! Then the golf began. Daddy was in the group of plebs! Steve and Nick. To spice up proceedings we hired a golf buggy which Steve had to learn pretty quickly. Especially when Daddy firmly planted his large feet on the accelerator.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_08-05-PhilGolf.jpg</src><caption>Kingster made good use of his book</caption></image><p>The weather had improved and the golf was good, and the buggy was tested! Nick cheated a couple more times than Daddy, but a round of 122 was a pleasing score, especially as it was the first ever 18 holes played. Thanks to Phil for laying on a great day and golfing partners Nick and Steve.</p><p>In the evening we went over to Hardy's in Bagshot to celebrate both Michael and Charlotte's birthday. We had a nice Mexican meal and a few Corona's. The Elders stayed the night. All four of them in Mummy and Daddy's bed!</p>

    <title>Rock Climbing, Church Fair and Phil and Anna's Wedding Celebration</title>
    <info>
		<p>We ventured over to Alton where Katie and Joey went rock climbing on the auto belay. Joey ascended like a monkey. Katie was a little more cautious but enjoyed it enough to have another go some time in the future. Unfortunately Ben was too young.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_09-01-RockClimbing.jpg</src><caption>Joey and Katie Rock Climbing</caption></image><p>We popped back to the Elders for some lunch, before returning back to St Andrews' church fair. Great Grandad was running the trasure map stall. We quickly flittered away our budget on games which was enjoyed by all.</p><p>We then rushed home as Mummy and Daddy had to prepare for Phil and Anna's wedding. Ma Ma and Pop Pop came over to babysit us.</p><p>The wedding was really good and a lot of fun. The wedding ceremony itself happened on Thursday, but the main celebrations happened today at Audley Woods, Basingstoke. The congregation was 150 strong, and a chance for Mummy to be with Daddy's friends without the children.</p><p>So many nice touches, all that wine (which Daddy later regrets), the troll like people, the toys on the tables and the characterture artist.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_09-00-PhilAnnaWedding.jpg</src><caption>Charactertures</caption></image><p>Anyway needless to say a good time had by all. Daddy was worse for wear after leaving. He was sick out of the car as we sped down the M3 back home. However, not everything finished outside of the car. Having got home Daddy realized that his shirt was covered and needed to take it off before meeting the in-laws! What a state. Mummy was not happy and Daddy spent an hour and a half cleaning the car the morning after!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_10-04-PhilAnnaWeddingMorningAfter.jpg</src><caption>Aftermarth</caption></image>

    <title>Cross Farm Maypole Fair</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie was again involved in her school's Maypole Fair. She performed with her class in front of alot of parents and grandparents and done very well. Daddy was in charge of the bouncey slide afterwards. I'm sure there was a health and safety risk with so many children on it at once! Anyway, Katie is very lucky to have 3 grandparents, 2 great grandparents and a great uncle there.</p><p>In the afternoon Ma Ma and Pop Pop popped around for a cup of tea, then we watched High School Musical 3 which down very well. Katie, especially hooked!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_16-06-Maypole.jpg</src><caption>Katie Maypoling</caption></image>

    <title>Hampstead Heath and Kentish City Farm</title>
    <info>
		<p>Another exciting trip to London to seek pastures new. We headed north towards Gospel Oak which had an entrance to Hampstead Heath. A huge park which had a fantastic playground. It was a really hot day, so the paddling pool was a welcome relief. Probably the bigest play area we've been to.</p><p>After our picnic we moved down to Kentish City Farm. I'm not sure what it is about these city farms we visit, there is something we like about them (....yeah probably because they are free!!!). Anyway, all the usual animals were there. Katie as usual, a cowardly custard, running scared of most of the animals, Jessica really enthusiastic and making some of the animal noises. Ben was just being Ben.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_20-14-HampsteadHeath.jpg</src><caption>Ice Cream Licking Good</caption></image><p>They had a riding ring, so Katie was fortunate enough to be led around two circuits which she enjoyed.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_20-17-HampsteadHeath.jpg</src><caption>Horsey Horsey Don't You Stop</caption></image><p>We returned to the playground again, due to popular demand to have another run around. Game of the day, was 'Monsters'. We caught a double decker and sat at the top and at the front back to a busy Oxford Circus. We hadn't seen so many people in one place before. We had a really nice day out and everyone was well behaved, even Daddy! It was heart warming to see Katie and Ben skipping along hand in hand through out the day.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_20-25-HampsteadHeath.jpg</src><caption>Jessmunta</caption></image>

		<p>
        In the afternoon we went over to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Great_Park">Windsor Great Park</a>, and our objective was to reach the King George III Statue. Katie and Ben took their bikes and we took bats and balls and various games to play. It was a really nice day again, almost too hot!
      </p><p>We climbed the rocks and some logs in the woods. We tried cricket, but after about 2 minutes the only players were Mummy and Daddy! We also played football and then Mummy and Daddy's childhood game, Polo.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_24-10-WindsorGreatPark.jpg</src><caption>Trunk Shot</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_24-23-WindsorGreatPark.jpg</src><caption>Trunk Shot</caption></image>

    <title>Wests and Swimming</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went swimming at Farnborough. Jessica is pretty confident in the water for her age. She even jumps in off the side without worrying about going under water. Farfar came to watch and then took us out for a Hungry Horse meal!</p><p>In the afternoon the Wests came over to show off their tan after their recent return from Turkey.</p>

    <title>Kent Seaside and Countryside</title>
    <info>
		<p>We spent this weekend down at Ma Ma and Pop Pop's. The weather was glorious. We headed further east towards Westgate, near Margate. A large sandy beach. We of course made sand castles and dug for victory. We attempted a bit of rock pooling but had no luck on finding anything.</p><p>Although hot, there was a chilly wind, but this did not deter Mummy, Katie and Ben who all went into the sea. Playboy Benny just lay naked in the shallow parts loving the lapping waves. Katie when quite far out on the inflatable dolphin. An ice cream later we decided to move on to Minis Bay. However, the playground was the only port of call. As Benny said, we're all beached out!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_30-38-WestgateOnSea.jpg</src><caption>Sea monsters!</caption></image><p>On our return we stopped off at Reculver Towers, a roman fort and castle, drove through Mount Ephraim Gardens and saw lots of hop fields. Picturesque village where we want to go to the pub = Hernhill. Lovely.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_30-47-WestgateOnSea.jpg</src><caption>Reculver Towers</caption></image>

    <title>Swanley Park and Terminal 5</title>
    <info>
		<p>After church we headed over to Swanley park where it was absolutely packed. Ben was proud of his new pants that Ma Ma had got him. He really is a clothes concious dude. So proud of his new stuff.</p><p>We then hot trotted it over to Terminal 5 at Heathrow to meet Farmor and Auntie Susan who have been in Copenhagen. There was a noisey lot of Indian's who were chanting tribal tunes which was rather nice. There was also some sweet kids who held out a 'Welcome Home Daddy' poster..... only to find 10 minutes later the Daddy was Gary Gale! Spooky. Tapped him on the shoulder and said hello.</p><p>Susan and Farmor followed shortly afterwards. We said our hello and goodbyes, then made a mad rush through the fountains of water which was fun.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_05_31-05-HeathrowAirport.jpg</src><caption>It's Terminal For The Five</caption></image>

    <title>Drayton Manor with Thomas and Natasha</title>
    <info>
		<p>We arrived at Drayton Manor, or as we know it, Thomas Land and met with the Burrows'. Daddy was assuring everyone that the rain would clear and it'll all be OK. Next time he should not raise expectations! Strangely enough the wet weather was a blessing, as the queues were short allowing us to have plenty of go's on rides.</p><p>First up was Thomas Land. The particular hit was the Troublesome Trucks rollercoaster, and the Cranky Crane vertical drop ride, which Kelly dipped out of, citing fartherly baby sitting duties as an excuse, and Mrs Burrows coming off a little bit worried! All the children loved it. There were rides in Thomas Land even for the little'uns, Jessica and Natasha.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_06_07-13-DraytonManor.jpg</src><caption>Cranky Cranes</caption></image><p>Rosie gave us a ride to the picnic area, where we actually snuck into the cafe to eat. It was pouring with rain outside. Daddy was sporting a ripped, yellow poncho which was the most useless thing ever. It was later binned.</p><p>Hungry for some more action, we took the cable car over the park which Thomas really enjoyed, especially looking out for Ben and Katie in the car infront. Daddy and Fiona managed to have a quick go on G-Force, a really fast rollercoaster. We were very impressed as they went upside down!</p><p>We moved to the big wheel, and the shooting gallery, where we are all slighlty concerned at Kelly's handy use with a firearm. The Burrow's thrashed the Gay team's score by 12 to 1!</p><p>The ride, which went down a lead baloon was the pirate boat ride. Kind of a ghost train on water. Mummy assurred everyone that it was not scarey at all. Anyway after the 10th skeleton popping out on us, the children were not very amused, and I think managed to get most of them crying!</p><p>Katie's favourite was the Buffalo rollercoaster, or as Thomas called it a, 'roaster coaster'. We squeezed a final, second go on the bumper cars at the end of the day, which was Ben's best ride.</p><p>We returned home via the chip shop rather tired, but had a lovely day.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_06_07-20-DraytonManor.jpg</src><caption>Bootifull girls</caption></image>

    <title>Rowing Up The Wey Navigation</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy on a shipping vessel. Everyone is at risk. Ranging from throwing up, on more than one occassion, on a ferry, to almost knocking Uncle Michael on a yacht, or playing bumper boats and catching fishing lines in a small motor boat, going on a shipping vessel is never a relaxing time with Daddy. However, there was the five of us plus the fars in a small rowing boat for 3 hours.... That surely defines a relaxing Sunday afternoon, especially Ben's recent record of falling into a river!</p><p>We started with a picnic by the boathouse in Farncombe and then Farfar started rowing north in the Guildford direction. We weren't too sure on how it was going to go, but all of us were enjoying it. Benny wanted to have a go at rowing, but it was pretty difficult to get him involved as he wanted to do it all himself. On the way, we saw a few baby ducklings on the water's edge which was very cute. About an hour in and we came to our first lock. Very exciting as well never had to manage the lock gates before. All went without a hitch thank goodness.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_06_07-14-RowBoat.jpg</src><caption>Blind leading the blind</caption></image><p>At the half way point at Shalford we disembarked and popped to the Parrot for some refreshments. Us children enjoyed playing with the ice cubes in the water and partiucularly enjoyed all the crisps.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_06_07-22-RowBoat.jpg</src><caption>Refreshments for the sailors</caption></image><p>Daddy had a go at rowing next, and after pushing away from the banks on a few occassions we made steady progress, although Mummy prefers Farfar doing it as he was faster! Back to the lock again, and this time Katie, Ben and Daddy stayed in the boat whilst in the lock. I think this was there favourite bit. Oh and just before hand, at the crucial moment, Ben needed the toilet. There was no option but to go over the side! Honestly, you can't take the Gay's anywhere!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_06_07-37-RowBoat.jpg</src><caption>Better out the boat than in!</caption></image><p>After about 3.5 hours the children were getting a bit restless, so everyone except Daddy and Farfar got off and decided to hurl abuse and leafs at Daddy and Farfar who were rowing back to the boathouse. After four hours, we eventually made it back. At £12 an hour it wasn't the cheapest afternoon, but the children really enjoyed themselves and it was good to give them a different experience. Thanks Farfar and Farmor.</p>

    <title>Army Show, Rainbows Camp, Amy Tyas Birthday, Elders Over to sleep</title>
    <first name="katie">Away from family overnight</first>
    <info>
		<p>It was a super hot day. In the morning we went over to the RLC show, which is Deepcut's best kept secret. A 'free' army show. The Fars came and joined us. We went on some army vehicles, the fairground's 'fun house', and roundabout rides. Ben and Daddy went on the ghost train, which Daddy felt was a bit X-rated. Ben wasn't sure when he went round, butafterwards was positive he was not scared and wanted to go again! Katie won the inflatable assault course race and climbed the highest on the climbing wall.</p><p>We unfortunately didn't have long, and straight after lunch we took Katie over the girl guides site near Tilford, where she was to stay the night with her 'Rainbows' pack. She was very excited and was involved in loads of activities. The theme was countries around the world. They done craft and cooking related to different countries. They made Russian dolls, American cookies, Italian pizza, etc. She didn't go to bed until 9:30pm!</p><p>The rest of us returned home to meet with the Elders. Mummy and Jessica went with them back over to the last of the Army show, whilst Daddy and Ben went to Jakes for Amy's birthday party.</p><p>Joey and Lily stayed whilst Michael took Ellie on the motorbike for the first time. Successfully! They were both very well behaved and we played games and even got Joey into Star Wars probably much to their parents disgust.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_06_27-00-RLCShow.jpg</src><caption>RLC Fun</caption></image>

    <title>Daddy Faces Firing Squad and Takes The Fars On The Motorbike</title>
    <info>
		<p>We picked Katie up from Rainbow camp. She really enjoyed herself and the leader had presented her with Olivia, the Rainbow doll. Awarded for being a really good girl and having lovely manners. Very proud parents!</p><p>Then on the way on home we saw the opposite behaviour. If only the Rainbow leader could see her then! If Katie is tired then we all know about it.</p><woops woopstitle="Faced with the Army at a shooting range, ready to shoot" rating="8"><p>Later I went for a bike ride up on Mytchett Ranges, where we had gone before for walks. Anyway about a couple of miles in and I coast down this hill which has a big mound at the bottom and to one side.</p><p>I cycle past and on the other side there are about 30 soldiers all crouched down with their guns ready to shoot at the target which is about 5 yeards to my right! Woops.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_06_28-HenleyRanges.jpg</src><caption>I came down the path on the right</caption></image><p>There is just silence, and lots of intimidation. They just stare at me as I trundle past. Even 20 yards past, they say nothing, freeze their positions and just stare. Goodness knows what they must have thought. It dawned on me that they wouldn't be too happy. Anyway 50 yards further and I am out of sight, and a volley of gunfire rattles of into the targets!</p><p>Cycling back I noticed that the red danger flags were out.... which I kind of missed. Thinking about it, I now know why I didn't see anyone else on the ranges! Mmmm.</p></woops><p>Later in the day, Daddy borrowed a spare motorbike helmet, and took both Farmor then Farfar on a short ride..... Farfar was confident enough just to be in shorts!</p>

    <title>Fruit Picking With The Fars, Karen's Baby Shower</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Daddy and Benny went off to do some errands around town which was nice to do some father - son bonding.</p><p>In the afternoon we went with the fars to a 'pick your own'... with Farfar and Jessica leaving evidence about their chops and tops that not all the fruit went into the punnets!</p><p>Jessica wasn't feeling too well. She had been sick over night and during the day, so Daddy stayed at home with the Fars and Jessica and treated Ben to a Stars Wars and chocolates night. Ben could not stop talking all the way to the film's end at 9:15. Wow, his invisible friend has quite a lot, including having the seventh episode of Star Wars. We love Ben.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mummy and Katie went to Karen's baby shower down in Alton. They had a great time, with Katie turning into Mummy at the party.</p>

    <title>Hayes to Greenford Canal Ride - Danish Lunch</title>
    <info>
		<p>Whilst Mummy, Katie and Ben walked to church, Daddy and Jessica decided to go for a bike ride off the Grand Union. The initial plan was to go to the picturesque Slough. However, we found the Paddington Arm first so headed east towards London. Within the first 200 yards we had to detour through the even more picturesque Southall!</p><p>The plan was to see how far we got after an hour then turn back. We reached Greenford. Jessica was very sweet banging the saddle as Daddy got off for a rest. On the return leg she fell asleep, as Daddy kept feeling her bobbing head hitting his back.</p><p>We rushed back, stopping on the M25 to refit the bike to the back of the car! Woops see the picture.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_07_05-00-HayesToGreenfordCanal.jpg</src><caption>Canal Ride</caption></image><p>We met up with the Fars and Tremears in Richmond Close for a joint celebration of Daddy's 34th birthday and the Tremear's first wedding aniversary. Farmor went to so much effort to prepare a Danish style lunch, which included herring, breads, cheeses, meats, frekideller allsorts, including two puddings!</p><p>Uncle Graham was architecting a big cardboard house which included a chimney and Sky dish, whilst the rest of us had a go at painting it. Farfar had also devised a genius treasure hunt which took us up and down the street. Not sure who enjoyed it more, the children or Mummy! We had a real nice time. Thanks Farmor and Farfar.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_07_05-08-DanishLunch.jpg</src><caption>Our new house</caption></image>

		<p>We had a real busy day ahead of us. Daddy cycled down to the village and spent 3 hours dressing the playschool lorry, particularly proud of the bushy front!</p><p>Meanwhile the rest of us were on the Green setting up the tombola stall which also had a rubber duck pool and cakes for sale. Ma ma and Pop Pop where split between our stall and Uncle Peter's who was there selling Uncle John's royal china.</p><p>The Fars and Sanders came to watch procession. The theme for the playschool lorry was the Lion King, and for Cross Farm it was Noah's Ark. I think Katie and Ben enjoyed it.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_07_12-00-FrimleyGreenCarnival.jpg</src><caption>Frimley Green Carnival</caption></image><p>After the procession we swiftly went on to Lewis' birthday party at Jake's softplay.</p>

    <title>Katie and Natasha's Birthday Party - Harrison's and Emma's Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>A day of birthday parties, starting with Emma's 6th birthday. Katie and Ben were on fire. They were hyper and played so well together. Whilst Katie was playing in Jakes, the rest of us walked around Bagshot and ended up at a playground.</p><p>After lunch, we ventured over to the West mansion for Harrison's 2nd birthday. Harrison is really growing quick and seems streets ahead of Jessica in terms of speech.</p><p>Then came the main event. This year we decided to have a joint party with Natasha. 28 kids! Paula had done so much work to organise most of it. It was held at Tomlinscote School.</p><p>The first half an hour we had games which involved alot of running around. The second tranche involved the swing rope and bouncey castle, and the final part was the party food. All the kiddies had such a good time, although I think the whistles in the party bag was a step too far. Special mention to Teales and Weston's for coming over from Kent especially.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_07_18-24-KatieBirthdayParty.jpg</src><caption>Katie and Natasha</caption></image><p>We returned home and began to open the loads of presents that we received. Favourites were the football and gardening tool set.</p>

		<p>Katie and Mummy ran in the Southsea race for life today. It was a 5km (3 mile) run. Katie jogged the whole distance. We were all so proud of her. People in the crowd were cheering her on and the other runners were encouraging her. At the end we got a medal and a goody bag, it took us 40 minutes. Daddy, Ben and Jess were in the crowd but unfortunately we didn't see them.</p><p>Sorry no pics of the racers just of the spectators.... well under control.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_07_19-05-RaceForLife.jpg</src><caption>Sisterly Love</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_07_19-09-RaceForLife.jpg</src><caption>The Body Slam</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_07_19-12-RaceForLife.jpg</src><caption>Cutey-pants</caption></image>

    <title>Eclectic modes of travel Ben and farfar 'training' together</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ben and farfar had time out together on the Watercress steam railway. They set off just after twelve o’clock on the 48 bus to Brookwood where they caught an electric train to Alton. A short wait there was all that was needed before the steam engine Lord Nelson arrived and took them to Alresford. After filling up with sweets and drink, they took the diesel train back to Alton, sitting on the front seat behind the driver and seeing all the track and signal in front on their way. They also they saw Thomas and Gordon stuck in the sidings at Ropley.</p><p>It was then another electric train to Aldershot to catch the number 1 bus to Farnborough. There was only one minute spare there so they ran to the next bus, the 48, which took them back to Deepcut home again just before six o’clock. The drizzly weather did not spoil a happy day out travelling on all sorts of different vehicles; two electric, one steam and one diesel train, plus three buses,</p>

    <info>
		<p>Our little girl, is no longer that little. She's now reached 6 today. Katie opened her presents in Mummy and Daddy's bed. She got plenty of lovely presents.... alot revolved around High School Musical. She got:</p><ul><li>High School Musiscal dolls</li><li>High School Musicial dressing up outfit</li><li>Book tokens</li><li>Pads, booklets, pens, etc.</li><li>High school musical watch</li><li>Beauty and the Beast theatre tickets</li></ul><p>We went down and switched the TV on to see if the card that Mummy made for her would make an appearance on CBeebies. There was some tension and almost an acceptance that it wouldn't be shown 4 years on the trot. However, it made it. We were all so excited to see the card and hear our names read out by Andy the presenter.</p><p>We organised a mini-party for some of Katie's friends. Leah S, Nina and Natasha from school came over to join the Elders for some party food. They all played well.... although what a mess that was made!</p><p>Later in the day the Fars popped across to drop their present off.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_07_24-17-KatieBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Katie's birthday Cake</caption></image>

    <title>Benjamin's 4th Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had the Elders and Ma Ma over to help open the presents in Mummy and Daddy's room. Presents most interested in were anything Star Wars related of course. He got a Obi Wan ship and some Clone Wars figures. He also got Marble Madness from Mummy and Daddy. Another good'un was an Indiana Jones hat and whipp, with sound effects of course.</p><p>We camped infront of the TV at 8am waiting to see if Ben's card will make it on to CBeebies..... and as tradition follows, Andy read out the card to us all!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_05-09-BenBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Ben's Card On Tele</caption></image><p>We hired the playschool hall out, and Ben was on adrenalin overload.... playing rough and tumble on the far too small bouncey castle. Thomas I think was the main buddy he was rough and tumbling with. Ben got a Man Utd. kit from Auntie Charlotte and Chris.... that's a Man Utd kit before any other kit English kit let it be known!</p><p>There were toys to play with from home, some party food and of course some games. There seemed to be more girls attending than boys! Daddy popped in his lunch break, and popped off again once the two hour session was up. Nice to see so many friendly, helpfull faces.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_05-16-BenBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Party on dude</caption></image><p>We had some more visitors over the afternoon including the Uncle Richard S, the West clan, and the Tremear's. However, Ben had overcooked it, and was slumped on the sofa asleep by 6:10!</p><p>In the evening Mummy went to find the results out from her CT scan. Thank goodness the results were good. As the doc said. We can now draw a line under this issue and move on. Ma ma and Pop Pop were waiting anxiously, as well as so many friends. Thanks to all the well-wishers.</p><p>Pop Pop took Ma Ma home after her week's stay. Ma Ma was such a help and it would have been hard to get through without her. Big thanks to Ma Ma. At least she got her own bed for the first time in weeks!</p>

    <title>Dawlish Warren Holiday - Lyme Regis</title>
    <info>
		<p>We set off a little earlier than expected and started off with the 'spotting game'. Spot something on our list and we all get a sweet. We decided to pop into Charlotte's in Salisbury only to find she wasn't in! Oh well it gave Daddy a chance to drive on some roads he hasn't done before. Sad!</p><p>There was quite a lot of traffic... Bloomin' holiday makers! Just after Dorchester we turned off into a country lane and picniced in some corn field in the sun.</p><p>We continued westwards and stopped at the popular Lyme Regis. A lovely place. It was a little strange half stone, half sand. We covered Katie in sand, then we went off to paddle in the water and look on the rocks for crabs.</p><p>We had a long walk back to the car, and then continued on to our holiday camp in Dawlish Warren. The kids were really excited with our static. It is so good to see. Running in and out of the rooms, around outside, exploring the swiming pool and adventure playgroud. We had a latish night. Jessica slept in her own bed.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_08-23-LymeRegis.jpg</src><caption>Climbing up at Lyme Regis</caption></image>

    <title>Dawlish Warren Holiday - Beach</title>
    <info>
		<p>The weather was good waking up after a good nights sleep in our new home for a week. We mozied on down to the camp swimming pool. The outdoor one was freezing, and Ben pushed mummy in! What a tinker.</p><p>In the afternoon we set ourselves on the beach just around the corner on Dawlish Warren. We got the big black tyre and set Katie and Ben out on to the seas. Daddy meanwhile was having a whale of a time building dams by the rocks with Jessica. An ice cream later, we carried on all afternoon. Dawlish Warren was buzzing and very popular.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_09-03-HolidayPark.jpg</src><caption>Ben in swimming gear</caption></image>

    <title>Dawlish Warren Holiday - Lydford Gorge</title>
    <info>
		<p>The weather wasn't great today. After some crazy golf we headed into Dartmoor, the scenic route that only Daddy knows. Well we were in the clouds, it was very misty. So much so, we couldn't see any scenary. Whenever we passed sheep and goats in the road, Jessica went mad. She was so excited. Mummy read Enid Blyton's, Naughtiest Girl book, which gripped us all, even Daddy. 'Read another chapter'. It passed the time right to Lydford Gorge.</p><p>We whipped out the National Trust cards and entry was ours. We embarked on the 3 mile journey. Jessica on Daddy's back, and a mix of Katie and Ben on Mummy's. The canopy of tree cover, made up for the lack of raincoats. We had visited 4 years previous with just a single child. Now with three it's a bid harder treking around as there were some quite dangerous bits, remember we have the clumsiesed boy in the world, Ben. He was tripping all over the place. Doh. Katie calls Ben a 'Bongo', which is her derogitary term. Daddy took Jessica to Devil's Cauldron. Jess was having more fun putting her cold hands down Daddy's back! It felt as if we were in a Brazilian rainforest, with trees high, high above us, lots of mist and pretty humid.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_10-11-CrazyGolfSwings.jpg</src><caption>Crazy Golfing</caption></image>

    <title>Dawlish Warren Holiday - Kent Caverns, Oddicombe Beach</title>
    <info>
		<p>After numerous games of Top Trumps, a la Star Wars version, Ben 10 version and High School Musical we then went swimming. Katie and Ben had made friends with the two children in the next caravan, who happened to be in the swimming pool as well. Ben pushed Daddy into the cold, outdoor swimming pool. Everyone around the pool found it highly amusing.</p><p>Jessica wasn't so keen at the pool, so Mummy took Jessica back and prepared a picnic. The three of us then played for ages with the snorkle, goggles and flip-flops (flippers).</p><p>We headed off in the car and top just south of Teignmouth on a scenic spot overlooking the sea, which included 10 oil tankers moored off the coast.</p><p>Kent Caves in Torquay was next stop. These historic caves boasted some finds from hundreds of thousands of years ago. Before the tour we took the Woodland Trail, and completed the activity sheet which involved finding wooden animals in the trees and bushes. Katie was especially good at this. We then took the tour and all three weren't sure with the light and sound show at the start. All a bit scared. However, as we continued around we all got better, except Katie who really was clinging onto Mummy. At one point the guide switched all the lights out which was a bit scarey. It truly was pitch black.</p><p>After we scaled down on the cliff tram down to the Oddicombe beach which was close by. Ben spent Uncle Steven's birthday money on a rubber ring which was duely used straight away out on the sea. Katie and Ben loved playing out there as Daddy towed them up and down the beach.</p>

    <title>Dawlish Warren Holiday - Killerton</title>
    <info>
		<p>We swum in the morning. Katie and Ben were quite content going in the cold outdoor pool. Mummy started on the Secret Seven book on the way to another National Trust site, Killerton, just north of Exeter.</p><p>There was good weather and we struck lucky as there was a princess trail around the gardens. This of course excited us and Mummy the most. In our element. We found all the clues and rested on the verge. All three of us then played rolly-polly down the hill with great hillaritory.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_12-39-Killerton.jpg</src><caption>Katie in front of the countryside</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_12-40-Killerton.jpg</src><caption>Daddy and Ben enjoying a rest</caption></image><p>Katie and Ben had there faces painted before swings and home time. We had a nice BBQ which seemed to atract a load of kids, especially when Mummy offered toasted marshmellows all around.</p>

    <title>Dawlish Warren Holiday - Paignton Zoo</title>
    <info>
		<p>We headed south to Paignton Zoo and once we arrived realized we'd forgotten the picnic! At the entrance were the flamingo's, which Katie and Ben couldn't say. Jessica on the other hand was more interested in the ducks who were sharing the pond.</p><p>Early on we saw a lion prowl around it's enclosure, we found it hard to see the tigers, but the best bit was seeing the Orguntangs who were on their own island in the trees. They were stripping bark and sucking the sap out of them. One of them fell out of their tree!</p><p>We also saw the Gorillas which were fascintaing. One came surprisingly up to the edge of the cage where we were, which gave Jessica quite a fright. Daddy went off to buy a picnic with Jessica, then we had a go on the train around the zoo.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_13-04-PaigntonZoo.jpg</src><caption>Katie and Paignton Zoo Train</caption></image><p>In the afternoon we went to the new crocodile swamp which was one of Katie's favourites. We saw a zebra, giraffes, a rhino and Jessie's favoutite elephants. Then came the best bit of the day for all three.... the soft play! Disappointing eh?</p><p>We made it back for a quick last swim and a trip down to the 'clubhouse' where there were some organised games for us.</p>

    <title>Dawlish Warren Holiday - Burgh Island</title>
    <info>
		<p>Another swim in the morning, this time Katie pushing Daddy into the cold outdoor pool. We travelled south to the coast and Burgh Island. Well it wasn't an Island currently as it wasn't high tide. We picniced on the spit of sand before embarking on the walk across to the Island, with it's iconic, art deco hotel. Jessica done ever so well and moutaineered to the top of the Island where there was a deriliced old stone house, and views back to the various beaches and cliffs along the shore.</p><p>We returned back to the sand and paddled and made a big canal, which included some sand castles, a big hill and even a tunnel which Daddy was proud of. We all enjoyed the day only marred by the parking ticket we got. We arrived just as the officer was ticketing us!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_14-31-BurghIsland.jpg</src><caption>Katie model shot in front of Burgh Island Hotel</caption></image><p>Homeward bound back to the caravan, said goodbye to our friends Harry and Jessica, then went back to Dawlish Warren for Fish and Chips overlooking the beach.</p><p>In the evening Daddy beat Mummy on the week long, Top Trumps challenge. Ben has learnt to walk more on this holiday and not be carried by Mummy whilst Jessica has let mummy feed her without a big fight.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_14-66a-BurghIsland.jpg</src><caption>Last Day Family Shot At Dawlish Warren</caption></image>

    <title>Dawlish Warren Holiday - Montacute House</title>
    <info>
		<p>Home day. Boo Hoo. The weather wasn't great. We awoke to rain... and an open sun roof in the car! We had one last dip in the swimming pool... and the joke of pushing Daddy in the cold pool wasn't wearing thin for the kiddies. I'm not sure we are getting value for money at £80 a term on the swimming lessons - Katie struggled to do three strokes!</p><p>The traffic wasn't great on the way home. We stopped off another National Trust house, Montacute. We had our picnic in the car park! There was a wedding in the house which made a picture.</p><p>Daddy explored the house with it's paintings, whilst the rest of us went to play on the swings. A great holiday, nice of the five of us to spend time together and have some fun.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_15-11-MontacuteHouse.jpg</src><caption>Montacute House</caption></image>

    <title>Haleemah's Birthday, Farfar's Birthday, Chertsey Football</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went to Haleemah's Birthday party at Byfleet village hall. It was nice to be invited as we've not known her for very long. We didn't know anyone else either. The kiddies had a nice time on the bouncey castle.</p><p>We then went over to Brooklands and went on their playground. It was quite cool as there were mini race tracks and luckily we had brought some bits and pieces to race on.</p><p>
        We then went over to Alwyns Lane to see the mighty Chertsey Town and to give Farfar's Presents. Here are some

		<p>We split in the morning. Katie, Ben and Mummy walked to church, whilst Daddy and Jessica continued with the waterway cycle rides. This time we started at Staines and headed westwards. It was a gorgeous morning, and we admired the nice boats and luxurious houses. We made it all the way to Old Windsor Lock. Daddy turned around to see that, as usual, Jessica was asleep! Alright for some.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_23_03-ThamesRide.jpg</src><caption>Staines To Old Windsor Thames Ride</caption></image><p>After Sunday roast we went to church for the 'Teddy Bears' service and then picnic which was very nice.</p><p>
        Later in the afternoon we popped over to the Fars where Joan and Gert had just arrived for a weeks holiday. They gave us some packs of Lego and dominos. It was nice to see them.

    <title>Girls Camping Holiday - Herne Bay</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie, Ben and Jess wanted to be woken in the night to start our camping holiday as they thought that would be exciting, so we woke at 5:00 and set off for Ma Ma and Pop Pops soon after. We had eaten our big bag of sweets before even hitting the M25!</p><p>After meeting Ma Ma and the Elders, we set off for Herne Bay. It was lovely and warm and we found a nice spot on the beach. We had some lunch and Mummy took us in the sea. It was very scary as it went very deep as soon as you stepped in. Joey, Katie and Ben were swimming deeper than Mummy could stand! Jessica was a pickle not interested in the beach, only climbing the steps and trying to run along the promenade.</p><p>We then went to our campsite. Auntie Ellie was a complete pro putting up both tents in no time. We made it all cosy and then had a BBQ. The Marsh mellows would not toast. Jessica took a long time to sleep but evetually they all went off. Mummy needed the toilet 5 times in the night.</p>

    <title>Girls Camping Holiday - Westbrook Beach</title>
    <info>
		<p>We were staying at St.Nicholas At Wade which is a tiny village with one little shop. We decided to walk down to it and get a few groceries because it was too early for the beach. The kids had a lollypop.</p><p>We then went to Westbrook bay, Margate, where Mummy and Auntie Ellie used to go alot when they were little. It wasn't a very nice weather and all the children were tired and not up for doing much. We attempted crabing but noone was very enthusiastic. We had a little sandcastle competion and a picnic. It then started pouring down and we had to pack everything up and take shelter.  It only lasted a few minutes and Mummy really wanted to do the short walk to Margate to see what that was like now. Margate was very run down, lots of derelict buildings and dreamland was completely shut. However the old joke shop we used to love was open and Katie delighted in buying some joke sweets, a fake biscuit and a dog poo, intending to trick Pop Pop. In the dreamland carpark was a travelling fair and Katie, Ben And Joey were allowed two gos on rides. They chose to go on the funhouse twice. They loved it. Mummy took Lily on a really fast twister ride which she seemed to enjoy. Jessie went on a Merry-goround, but she screamed and the ride had to be stopped. We had an icecream on Margate Beach and then went back to the campsite. In the evening Pop Pop came over and we had fish and chips. Once the children were asleep Ma Ma and Mummy beat Pop Pop and Auntie Ellie at cards.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_25-18-HerneBayCamping.jpg</src><caption>Camping Breakfast</caption></image>

    <title>Girls Camping Holiday - Wildwood Animal Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>We walked down to the shop for our lollypop again this morning and then we found a swing park and stayed there a while playing chase and in the trees. It wasn't really beach weather so we decided to go to Wildwood, a little animal park with wolves, foxes, badgers, horses, wild boar etc. </p><p>Once again the childrens best bit was the adventure playground. Jessica loved the tube slide. Katie managed to spot a tiny frog in a pond of alge which she was very proud of. Joey, Ben and Lily had trouble seeing it so Mummy thought she would throw a little stone next to it to make it move, after a few attempts and it still not moving she got a bigger stone threw it and it landed on top the poor frog. It disappered beneath the water then and everyone accused mummy of killing it, Joey thought it very funny.</p><p>We got back to the campsite and had a waterfight using the waterbombs we bought at the joke shop yesterday. Katie was happy all the time she was getting others wet but didn't like getting wet herself! Ben got Mummy soaked. Later Auntie Helen came down and because she has an open top car Katie was able to put the joke poo on the seat, we also offered her the fake biscuit. Katie loves her jokes. We had a nice BBQ. Auntie Helen showed us how to put toasted marshmellows in chocolate biscuits, lovely. She also bought lots of sweets for the children.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_26-36-HerneBayCamping.jpg</src><caption>Joey and Katie enjoying the landscape</caption></image>

    <title>Girls Camping Holiday - Broadstairs</title>
    <info>
		<p>Beautiful weather today. Went down for our lollypop and a go on the swings. We then went to Broadstairs. Broadstairs is a lovely beach. We were all in and out of the sea. We wathched punch and Judy (Jessica hated it). The children had a go on the swingboats and helterskelter. We attempted another Merry go round withh Jessie and this time she loved it. Although she was naked and as it went round Mummy thought shes doing a poo and when she picked her up at the end sure enough on the carriage was a poo. Mummy had no tissues and because the ride operator seemed quite scary Mummy had no choice but to pick the poo up and bury it in the sand!</p><p>In the evening we went for a meal in the pub.During the meal the parasol flew over the fence into the neighbours garden, we all laughed because it was so funny, but the next minute the neighbour came round and complained because it had hit him, I don't think he or the landlord believed us when wev said it was the wind.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_27-68-HerneBayCamping.jpg</src><caption>Katie Swimming</caption></image>

Sad to hear she is suffering from a little colic currently.</p><p>We had a picnic and birthday cake. We also had a go in the kayak. Rachel pulled us around at first, then Daddy. Daddy had a great time going on the choppy seas with Jon. Fantastic skimming through the top of the waves, getting sprayed in the progress.

		<p>Mummy took Katie and Ben to church, whilst Daddy and Jessica embarked on the final half of the Paddington Arm of the Grand Union canal. We picked up where we had left off at Greenford and headed into central London.</p><p>7.5 miles and we reached Little Venice, a trendy place in the west end. We stopped for a rest. A lady let Jessica stroke her dog, although Jessica was just curious and didn't dare touch. On our journey we could hear the Notting Hill carnival, so decided to have a look.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_30-01-GrandUnionCanalPaddingtonArm-NottingHillCarnival.jpg</src><caption>Jessica At Little Venice</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_08_30-05-GrandUnionCanalPaddingtonArm-NottingHillCarnival.jpg</src><caption>Jessica At Little Venice</caption></image><p>Not to sure what Jessica thought of it. A very loud, party atmosphere, with a lot of Carribbean people dancing and jigging along the street. Jessica was just taking it all in. Not showing much emotion. There were alot of people, alot of smells and alot of noise. Anyway Daddy was glad to show Jessica another experience.</p><p>Jessica was very jovial on the way home, playing with Daddy as we rode back to the car.</p><p>In the afternoon, Charlotte and Chris came over and played lego and had a cuppa which was very nice.</p>

		<p>In the morning we went swimming over at Wokingham. Katie loved going on the flume, and Ben gutted he couldn't go on it.</p><p>We went straight over to watch Chris compete in the Moto Cross over in Fleet. Unfortunately he wasn't feeling too well. Still we saw him in half a race.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Ben was very excited at starting school. He was shaking with anticipation. He couldn't wait to get a reading book, couldn't wait for PE, couldn't wait to get his smart uniform on, and walk in with his various bags and be part of the school run with his big sister.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_09_09-08-BenFirstDayAtSchool.jpg</src><caption>Ben's First Day At School</caption></image><p>When Ben returned from school, he had enjoyed it. Jokingly mummy asked whether he had got into trouble, not expecting the answer of 'yes' being returned! He had run in the classroom. However, he did receive a star sticker from the headmistress for being attentive and quiet during lunchtime. It was hard to find out what he had actually had done, but we think it was pretty relaxed and alot of play.</p>

    <title>Littlehampton 10km - Family Picnic Jessicas Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>We all went down for a 9:30 start at Littlehampton for the second attempt at the 10km. There was a large field, and we had all pretty much improved from last year. Daddy was happy with his 51mins. Ellie and Rachel came in next at 54mins, Jon in 55mins, Rich in 1hr 5mins and Charlottte started very well, but faded slightly towards the end.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_09_13-06-Littlehampton10Km.jpg</src><caption>The joggers</caption></image><p>We raced back home, quickly had a bath and some lunch then headed straight out towards the eagerly awaited sprayground. It was the family celebration of Jessica's second birthday. Although it was overcast and a little windy, there was no question that the troops were going to get wet in the sprayground. They absolutely loved it.</p><p>We had a picnic, played football, cricket and bowls, fed the ducks and went into the playground. It was nice to have the family all together.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_09_13-08-StainesLammasPark.jpg</src><caption>Sprayground action</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_09_13-47-StainesLammasPark.jpg</src><caption>Sprayground action</caption></image>

    <title>School Daze</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie and Ben have been back at school for just over a week now. Katie is in a much bigger class now with 30 or so pupils, half of which are from the year below. She has had good remarks about her reading, especially the fact that she has put more expression into it. We attribute this down to Mummy reading the naugtiest little girl series of books in a similar style.</p><p>Ben has had mixed reviews, sometimes he has been told off, but not for being naughty as such. He has really enjoyed himself. He bounded up to the headmistress all proud that he had been given some homework. I'm going to learn how to draw the 'curly ker'. However, looking at his efforts, they are going to be long homework sessions!</p><p>Ben also has been having problems wetting himself. At P.E. he said that he didn't know that he was allowed to go to the toilet. On Wednesday, again he came proudly, bounding out of school and announced to all the mum's that he had actually put his willy in the toilet properly (rather than leaving it to its natural position which has soaked his trousers). A bit embarrassing for Mummy.</p><p>Next week, Katie and Ben will be in the same school photograph.</p>

    <info>
		<p>We went over to Greenwich today. After having a picnic at the top of the hill in Blackheath, we ventured down to the swing park. Ben was loving going down on his scooter. We had over-dressed for the day. It was pretty hot. We walked further through the market and town, to the Cutty Sark site, which now is reduced to some tents and on to the tunnel. We couldn't do the first race as the lift was out of order. All the children loved running through the tunnel and making lots of noise. Because Daddy lost the race to the top on the north side he had to buy a round of ice lollies. After a short peruse of the Thames, we wandered back to the car some 2 miles away!</p><p>We stayed the night in Istead Rise, however Ma Ma and Pop Pop were away sailing.</p>

The church service was nice and relaxed, and we had some nice nosh at event afterwards.

    <title>Chessington World Of Adventures</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went with the Weston's and Elder's, plus Uncle Peter, over to Chessington World Of Adventures. We had a great day, the weather being real nice. Katie's favourite ride was the fast boat ride, Ben's was the scarey Pirate Boat, where we all sat at the back, which Katie certainly did not enjoy, and Jessica loved looking around the animals, showing particular affinity to the 'rars' or lions.</p><p>Ma Ma and Pop Pop queued for 70 minutes on the Vampire ride, only for Katie to lose her bottle at the last minute! Mummy was certainly in charge, deciding what we all should do, and when we should do it! Lucky our children have aryan characteristics and have signed up to her youth movement! Lily was a sweetie all day, Uncle Peter enjoyed a snooze on the monorail. I think all the adults were envious of him at that point in time. The big battle of the day, was not amongst the children, instead it was the donkey derby challange. Pop Pop versus Auntie Ellie.... and Pop Pop came on top, although I am sure there should have been a stewards enquiry after a bit of skulduggery from the Pop Pop camp. A good day had by all.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_09_26-28-ChessingtonWorldAdv.jpg</src><caption>Elders on the boat ride</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_09_26-32-ChessingtonWorldAdv.jpg</src><caption>Uncle Peter and Jessica chillin'</caption></image>

		<p>We headed off with the Fars to the Steam Fair over in Woking. Farfar particularly was looking forward to it as it reminded him of his youth, 150 years ago!</p><p>The Helter Skelter was a firm favourite, although Katie enjoyed the 'chairoplanes' the most who she shared a go with Mummy. Ben enjoyed co-driving in the bumper cars with Farfar, especially when he bashed up Daddy and Farmor's car.</p><p>Jessica was very focused on her rides. You never know if she is enjoying it or not. We had a lovely 3 hours there in the delightful sunshine, and old time organ music.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_09_27-07-SteamFunFair.jpg</src><caption>Jessica looking cool in her car</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_09_27-34-SteamFunFair.jpg</src><caption>Chairoplanes</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_09_27-42-SteamFunFair.jpg</src><caption>Traditional merry go round and helter skelter</caption></image>

    <title>Overnight Stay At The Fars</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went to Camberley for a spot of shopping. It was a nightmare trip as we got a parking ticket, and then went swimming, got changed only to find the pool was only open for 10 minutes. We then got home then lost our only proper front door key and car key!</p><p>In the afternoon, us children were shipped over to the Fars to stay the night. Mummy spent the afternoon in bed, whilst Daddy watched a really good film, The Fastest Indian In The World. Here is Farfar's report of our stay.</p><p>We had no problems when the three kids came to stay the night on Saturday. They were very good, if demanding, as you might expect. Jette took the load alone from 4.00pm until I arrived from football two and a half hours later. All went well although they did get to bed later than planned; the older two at around a quarter to nine. We had watched Strictly Come Dancing on BBC which prompted them to participate themselves.</p><p>With Jette’s help, Katie had a change of costume for every dance. They went upstairs between each dance where she donned one of Jette’s petticoats or skirts which, with the aid of a bulldog clip, was changed into flowing full length dresses. Ben kept to his Spiderman outfit but joined in the dancing, even if it was somewhat frantic with the emphasis being on clenched fists and whirling arms.</p><p>We had to award points after each dance. They tended to receive 9 or 10 for each effort. Strange that!</p><p>The up side of them going to bed late was that they slept through the night without incident and carried on until about twenty to eight in the morning, so we all had a restful night. The parents arrived at 9.30am for disposal.</p><p>In the evening Mummy and Daddy went over to the West's for a scrummy dinner.</p>

		<p>4:30 this morning and Farfar was rushed to hospital with a kidney stone. Fortunately the pain subsided as time passed and was out in the afternoon. Daddy, Ben and Jessica all went to see him with Farmor. It is the first time that Daddy has known Farfar to go into hospital.</p><p>The weather was quite changeable. We got caught out when we went for a walk at Windlesham Arboritum. Still all of us enjoyed rolling down the hills and generally larking about. It was quite picturesque.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_10_11-11-WindleshamArboritum.jpg</src><caption>Puddle-tastic</caption></image>

		<p>In the morning Daddy, Benny and Farfar went to a model railway exhibition. Surprisingly Ben seemed quite into it, asking plenty of questions, although I think the highlight was the chocolate cake, apple juice and a go on the playground come assault course afterwards. On the way home we quickly stopped off to watch some radio cotrolled helicopters being flewn.</p><p>After Sunday lunch, Daddy and Uncle Graham went to try 'Go Ape', a tree top assault course given from the Fars as a birthday present.</p><p>They both really enjoyed themselves. Susan, the Fars and Graham's mum endured the 2.5 hour journey around the course. Daddy was trying hard to do it properly, well attempting to do it without assistance from the safety ropes.</p><p>Afterwards we went around to the Tremear's for a quick cuppa.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_10_18-33-GoApe.jpg</src><caption>Aerial Sliding</caption></image>

    <title>The Fars - Stagecoach - Fantastic Mr Fox, Cinema</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie went with her friend Nina to a Stagecoach acting school for an hour or so, then was treated to a McDonalds afterwards! The class would normally cost £30! Gulp.</p><p>Meanwhile the rest of us invaded the Fars for a spot of lunch, and to see how Farfar is after his trips to the hospital and doctors again this week.</p><p>After suitably giving Farmor plenty to tidy up for the afternoon, we left for the cinema in Basingstoke. Ellie and Joey came with us to see the Fantastic Mr Fox, whilst Michael looked after Lily and Jessica. We all enjoyed the film, despite it having a different story to the book, and despite Daddy falling asleep half way through it!</p><p>We returned back to Alton, to find Jessica all made up beautiful with her hair done. She had a great time with Michael and Lily.</p>

    <title>Moto Crossing</title>
    <info>
		<p>Whilst the girls were at church, the boys went over to Chawton to watch Uncle Michael on his new Moto Cross bike. It was a really muddy test track ideal for beginers.</p><p>Then Daddy was invited to have ago. All kitted up and Daddy went on the test track, whilst Uncle Michael took me, Ben, to watch, right next to the biggest puddle in the world. One thing we didn't realize was how demanding on the arms moto-crossing is, and how different the skills needed are from an ordinary road bike.</p><p>When turning we have to move towards the handlebars so the front tyre gets more grip and poke your leg out. Rather than lean, you steer, and clutch and front brakes are a bit of a no no. 15 minutes and an interlude later, Daddy fully muddied himself out. It was really enjoyable, and he did get quicker and a little more confident as time went on. Uncle Michael the showed us how it was done.</p><p>Benny really got into it... well he got into the mud plenty of times, and pretended his bike was a moto cross bike, complete with sounds. When Joey turned up he was desperate to show how he can ride without stablizers, however, without success. He was so eager, to show off, but again ended in the mud! Anyway thanks to Uncle Michael.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_10_25-04-MartinMotoX.jpg</src><caption>Daddy in a puddle</caption></image><p>For the rest of the day we had Sunday lunch, did jobs, and played lots. Daddy took Jessica to watch the cars race around in the woods opposite. The weather was great. A lovely weekend.</p>

    <title>Joyce Visit, Halloween</title>
    <info>
		<p>We returned from a couple of days stay at Ma Ma and Pop and Pops yesterday which was nice, although Ben had a slight cold. This morning Joyce from Louisville came over to visit. Ben was straight in there telling the history behind his 'Lightsavers' and general Star Wars speak! Joyce had got perfect presents for them all. An Anakin Skywalker figure for Ben, High School Musical figures for Katie and a book for Jessica.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_10_31-01-Halloween.jpg</src><caption>Katie, Ben and Joyce</caption></image><p>Farmor came over a little later and we went up to feed the ducks. Ben was intent on showing off his cycling skills, but the lack of stablizers ment he landed on the floor more often than not.</p><p>In the afternoon we carved out a pumpkin, attempting to model it on Darth Vader. We also attempted to make a birthday cake for Pop Pop, although the results were true to form! Daddy went out to watch Chertsey get beat by Camberley in a top of the table clash.</p><p>Katie had a halloween party in Fleet which was very good, whilst the rest of us hooked up with Ma Ma and Pop and went on a Trick or Treat trail around the area. We stopped off at Natasha's, Farmors, Auntie Sue's, Great Grandma and Grandad's and finally ending up at Uncle Peter's. All sweets and chocolates were gratefully received!</p><p>We were five again and ended up playing apple and doughnut dunking. We didn't really get time to watch 'Strictly'.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_10_31-00-Halloween.jpg</src><caption>Katie, Ben and Joyce</caption></image>

    <title>Pop Pops Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>We headed off to Istead Rise to celebrate Pop Pop's birthday. After church we had two sittings of Sunday lunch, those who are mature and those who weren't so much (yes and Mummy was in with us).</p><p>It was all a bit mad. We ventured out to the swings for a bit, but otherwise played in. Lily still had a poorly ankle from the previous week so she found it difficult to walk.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_11_01-12-GeraldBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Mummy reading to Lily</caption></image>

    <title>Ben's first full day at school</title>
    <first name="benjamin">Full day at school</first>
    <info>
		<p>Because Ben is one of the younger members of the class, his first full day at school was staged for today. Instead of a 3 hour day, it is now 6. We think he has been a bit more tired during the week, but otherwise it has not phased him at all. He really enjoys school, and seems to have picked up reading very well. I also think he's doing well at Maths, well compared with Katie he is anyway.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_10_XX-KatieBenSchool.jpg</src><caption>Katie and Ben</caption></image>

    <title>Katie Locked In Her Bedroom Needing The Toilet</title>
    <info>
		<woops woopstitle="Katie Locked In Her Bedroom Needing The Toilet" rating="3"><p>Katie got up during the night to go to the toilet, she got to the bedroom door which was shut, and tried to open it. She pulled the handle down, however, the door would not open, she shouted and Mummy woke, Mummy shouted and Daddy woke. Poor Katie was getting in a right state, crying and stressing that she couldn't get out.</p><p>Daddy attempted barging the door down, to no avail, took the door handle off, to no avail. Mummy was insisting on getting the fire brigade, Katie insisted on employing the option of jumping from her bedroom window, and Daddy licking his lips at the prospect of getting the circular saw out to cut a hole in the door! 'Mummy I really need the toilet'. Katie calmed down, but Mummy and Daddy heard her whispering a little prayer to herself. 'Please God, let the door open' and some other mutterings. Mummy and Daddy's heart melted, because she was so scared, but had composed herself so well. Ben of course somehow slept through all the noise and commotion.</p><p>We ran out of options, so Daddy rang Farfar at 2:30am. Luckily he had not gone to bed yet! Eventually Katie could not hold on any longer. As to not wee on the carpet she had decided she would assemble a pile of clothes and wee'ed on them! Farfar turned up with tools and within 5 minutes had used screwdrivers to force the spring stopper open. The spring was no longer very springy. What a relief. Katie came in and slept with Mummy and Daddy. She had been very brave. However, now she does not like to be in a room where the door is locked. We are very proud of how she handled herself though.</p></woops>

    <title>Swimming, Reading V Ipswich, Fireworks</title>
    <first name="benjamin">Big Football Match</first>
    <info>
		<p>We had a real busy day. Auntie Charlotte had come up and stayed the night, so we played with her in the morning. Daddy, Katie and Ben went swimming in the Arena whilst the three other girls went shopping around Camberley.</p><p>In the afternoon all us 4 girlies stayed in and watched Hannah Montana, whilst the boys went out to football. It was Ben's first professional game. He had the choice to go or not, and was quite looking forward to it.</p><p>We parked a long way from the ground and walked in. Unfortunately we missed 'Phat Phil'. We found out seats, but Ben wanted to see the view from the highest seats in the house. He didn't say a great deal so it was hard to gauge what he was thinking. Daddy likes to think he was absorbing the situation and atmosphere.</p><p>The first half was pretty drab on the pitch, and there was not much atmosphere as there was nothing for the home support to cheer about. Still Ben, was asking questions about the linesmen, referee and some of the laws of the game.</p><p>We failed to meet up with Phil at half time, on our way back to our seats, Stuart Church scored and came running towards us near the corner flag. The supporters went wild. This was Ben's favourite bit. The second half was a lot better, the floodlights and atmosphere coupled with a rousing finish completed a great aftermoon out. Final score 1-1.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_11_07-03-ReadingIpswich.jpg</src><caption>At the Madejski Stadium</caption></image><p>We rushed home for fireworks. Ben unfortunately had tired himself out, so he was left at home with Daddy to watch Star Wars.... of course. Meanwhile the rest of us met with the Fars to watch the Ravenscote School Firework display. Farmor said they were the best she had seen in years!</p>

    <title>Evie Sanders Christening, Joey's Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was Evie's Christening today. Mummy was proudly chosen as a Godmother. She's taking the role quite seriously. She even had to have a seperate card to write her own personal message! The church at Elvetham Heath was pretty contemporary in many aspects. The service generally was pretty liberal in content, with powerpoint presentations and even a live tv link to the creche! It was very much orientated towards a family audience.</p><p>The service proceeded with the baptism. Evie was such a good girl, she did not make a murmur throughout. All the parents and godparents, plus Ben, stood at the front of the church. The other godparents were: Jon, Rachel and Richard's friend Dave.</p><p>After the service we filtered back to the Sanders household for a celebration drinks and food, with particular mention to the excellent coronation chicken.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_11_15-16-EvieSandersChristening.jpg</src><caption>Evie and her proud parents</caption></image><p>Ben attended Joey's Star Wars 5th birthday party in Lightwater. He took quatre of an hour to warm up, but after that got really into it. Instead of pin the tail on the donkey, they had pin the lightsabre on the jedi knight! Cool. They also had a big trasure hunt which was excellent. Just up Ben's street.</p><p>Later in the evening Daddy went out with some of the Barnett clan, to the Banger racing at Wimbledon.</p>

    <title>Pop Pop Father Christmas</title>
    <info>
		<p>We headed for the Southfleet church Christmas Fair, where the star turn was Father Christmas, also known as Pop Pop. Katie had figured this out last year so we had to tell her that Pop Pop was filling in for Father Christmas, as the real one was a bit busy at the moment! As soon as we entered the den, I mean grotto, although looking very convincing, the south-east London accent wasn't reminicent of a Father Christmas. Not only did Ben figure it out, a loud cry of 'Pop Pop' came from Jessica! Anyway we carried on the pretence as we got some nice presents! We had a mad dash going around the busy fair. Lucky dip, guess the teddy bear name and pick the straw were some of the games played.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_11_21-03-FatherXmasAndWalk.jpg</src><caption>Father Christmas with a south-east London accent!</caption></image><p>We headed back to Istead Rise for some lunch, then went for a walk up a country road very close to Ma Ma and Pop Pop's house. We brieflt met Pop Pop and Ma Ma before returning for Star Wars and Strictly Come Dancing.</p>

		<p>The Sanders crew came over for tea. Little Evie was a star and must have wondered what on earth was going on around her. Jessica retrieved poo from her bum with her hands, Ben was jumping off the middle stair onto cushions at the bottom and when we went out Katie got soaked jumping in puddles! Anyone want three energy driven children?</p>

So we started by getting the children ready for school, taking them to school, then Daddy and Jessica went off to Swindon for a spot of Christmas shopping! Jessica was great, although she was constantly hiding amongst the clothes and running off. However, it was a successful trip. We rushed back to pick Katie and Ben from school. Katie was very proud to be taking Eddie The Teddy home for the weekend. Thankfully Mummy was feeling alot better when we returned.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_11_27-03-EddieTheTeddy.jpg</src><caption>Katie with Eddie</caption></image>

		<p>In the morning we headed to other side of Guildford to go to Santa Firs. Basically it's a place that sells Chrsitmas Trees, but they've jazzed it up, offering horsey rides, tractor rides and a look at a real reindeer. It was good for what it was. We all loved it anyway.</p><p>Jessica was not 100%. She had a croaky voice. Anyway Mummy and Jessica went around the shops in Farnborough, while Daddy went for a long swim with Katie and Ben. Ben was able to swim a few metres under water, if not above it, and Katie swum the length of the baby pool, which I guess is about 20 metres!</p>

    <title>Reading v Scunthorpe</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we left for Notcutts to get some more Christmas Presents.</p><p>Daddy and Ben left about midday to catch a train to Reading and met up with 'Fat Phil', who isn't looking that fat (digging out frantically). Mmm. This then rather confirms things... we then went to McDonalds as a little treat for Ben, and not only did he have a happy meal, he got a Darth Vader toy and baloon. Ben was most pleased.</p><p>After filling our stomachs we caught a bus to the 'Mad Stadt', went into the 'Megastore' and 'Jazz Bar'. Phil then attempted to lure Ben away from Man Utd, and purchased a Reading top for Ben. Ben was most pleased!</p><p>We made it into the stadium about 10 minutes before kickoff. We sat very close to Phil, at the bottom of the stand, quite close to the corner flag. Ben was getting a little cold and tired. He finally wanted his coat on, and was wrapped under his blanket. He looked like an old man.</p><p>The game began and Ben fell asleep! It was quite an entertaining game, Reading were far the better team, asserting more pressure, creating more chances, but they only managed to convert one of them by half time.</p><p>Half time and we had our snacks, got a photo with Kingsley the Reading mascot and made our way to the very top of the stand. The view was great. Ben was most pleased.</p><p>The second half commenced and Ben got more into the game, asking some more questions about what was going on. Scunny scored late on, and like the previous occassion, the game turned into a real exciting finish. Both teams had great opportunities to go ahead. In the 89th minute Ben decided he was very desperate for the toilet! Thankfully we didn't miss anything. The final whistle blew and we made our way back to the bus, train and home. Ben wanted to get back for Strictly! Obviously Daddy needs to try harder to 'Man him up'!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_12-02a-ReadingScunthorpe.jpg</src><caption>Ben with Kingsley</caption></image><p>Thanks to Phil for a great treat out.</p>

    <title>Christmas Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today we dressed the house in Christmas decorations. the tree went up without too much bother. In the afternoon Daddy and Farfar took Jessica swimming over at Farnborough. She loved it. She just wanted to climb to the edge, jump in, goto the edge, jump in. We must have been in there for 45 minutes or so.</p><p>Last year, wit the troubles we were having with Jess and her sleeping we didn't host a Christmas Party, which we really missed. Katie and Ben were keen to join in, however it was a strictly adults affair, although Mummy and Daddy did feel sorry for Katie especailly, as she would be in her element.</p><p>The Elders were first to come, with Lily and Joey. We also had Karen, Rich, Evie, Helen, Nigel, Fee and Kelly. The traditional boys versus girls. Some dodgey memories of past results I feel.</p><p>This year's theme was 'I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here', which was an excuse to do some dodgey tasks with food.</p><p>First up was apple bopping. Ellie made what seemed a good first effort, getting soaked for her troubles, but Michael found a great technique and stormed to victory.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_13-12a-ChristmasParty.jpg</src><caption>Michael Bopping</caption></image><p>The Morley's next in marshmellow combat.

No contest. Kelly posted a very impressive time, claiming he went long 'because you never can be sure'.</p><p>Karen, with litle confidence stepped up, and smahed Kelly's time. Need to insert a list of Kelly's excuses here! I think one of them was that he done it on his wrong arm.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_13-23a-ChristmasParty.jpg</src><caption>A confident looking Kelly</caption></image><p>The final trial was probably the worst to be involved in. The taste challenge and the brave warriors were, Richard for the boys and Fiona for the girls. There were four foods. First a snail. There were complaints of a gritty, earthy taste. Neither of them had tasted Escagots before I don't think they'll be ordering it from a restaurant quickly. Next was a mouthful of tongue, then hot, hot, hot Green Jalapeno's. Had a bit of a kick. Then finally it was the anchovy paste. Again not a particular favourite. Both done very well, not letting their teams down.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_13-40a-ChristmasParty.jpg</src><caption>Fee taking a Jalapeno hit</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_13-41a-ChristmasParty.jpg</src><caption>Snail trail</caption></image><p>Dispersed amongst the trials was a spot of food and some other quiz games, including Michael's, Tv Themes Tunes, Film Sound Bites and 'Closest To The House Price' guessing game. At the end of the night scores were tied, and it was down to the final question. A Coronation Street piece of trivia. A girl must get this, but Nigel lept like a salmon and gave the boys galant victory.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_13-18a-ChristmasParty.jpg</src><caption>The concentration levels were immense during the house price guessing game!</caption></image><p>Thanks to all who came, we really enjoyed ourselves.

    <title>Thomas's 4th Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>We headed over to Purley for Thomas's 4th birthday party. There were 20+ children, which was very generous, not to mention brave. There was a dressing up theme to the party which wasn't just reserved for the children! There was an hours worth of softplay. Ben and Thomas played well together, tendering on the physical side. Later some party food and games in the second half.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_19-10-Thomas4thBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Superman and spidy</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_19-01-Thomas4thBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Jessica crawler</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_19-17-Thomas4thBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Colourful Katie</caption></image>

    <title>Natural History Museum, Selfridges and a meal</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy had a day off work so we all could go up to London to see Father Christmas. First we went on the tube to the Natural History Museum. All of a sudden Katie has got a fear of going on the underground, to go with her fear of ensuring doors are kept open. We think it stems back to the night where her bedroom door wouldn't open. Anyway, we trotted by the picturesque lights and ice rink outside the museum before going in. We didn't have much time so headed towards the blue whale area then on to the dinosaurs. The children seemed to enjoy themselves quite a bit.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_22-11-NaturalHistoryMuseum.jpg</src><caption>Natural History Museum trip</caption></image><p>We then headed to Selfridges on a double decker bus. Got off at Marble Arch and fought through the crowds. We were surprised to see Farfar waiting in line with us to see Father Christmas. He was allowed to join us on the magical train ride and into Father Christmas's cabin, where we had a little chat and a picture taken. Katie and Ben were a little shy, whilst Jessica was just plain scared. We reached the end. As we were sorting ouselves out, Katie happen to notice there was more than one Father Christmas working at a time, as there were multiple cabins. She was quite upset as she believed it to be the real Father Christmas. She said she was fed up on all the pretend Father Christmas's. She was confused and the pretence of a real Father Christmas existing was close to being destroyed. She put on a brave face, but certainly a big seed of doubt has been sown. Is this the final year for her?</p><p>Farfar joined us in a Pizza Express around the corner, before we made our way homeward bound.</p>

    <title>Christmas Eve</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy finished work at about 2:30pm, and headed home to play some games. We then went over to the Fars for the first of many Christmas gatherings. Farmor and Auntie Susan were busy in the kitchen, helped occassionally by Jessica, whilst Ben was entertaining Uncle Graham, with various Ben'isms!  We tracked Father Christmas's progress sporadically on the internet.</p><p>It was food time, and star of the show was the roast pork and lemon crunch dessert. Delicious.</p><p>Katie and Ben were egging for present opening time, and they went against the normal Gay tradition of one present only to be opened in the room at a time. It was almost a rush. Saying that, once opened they did spend time on each gift and much to our delight they said things like, 'this is what I really wanted', or 'I really could do with this'. This was not out of politeness, but what they really thought, which was nice to hear.</p><p>We returned home at 8pm, and prepared a glass of milk and mince pie for Father Christmas, plus a note from Katie telling him not to close her bedroom door when he leaves! We also sprinkled some reindeer oats on the path, although I'm sure most of them got spilt in the hallway! The children were shaking with excitement. However, they must have worn themselves out as they did not stay awake for very long.</p><p>Mummy went off to midnight mass, when she returned at 1am, Katie had woken, but still Father Christmas had not made an appearance. However, she seemed to wake every hour past 2am saying that Father Christmas had been and wondered if she could open them there and then.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_24-18-ChristmasEve.jpg</src><caption>What a beaut</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_24-23-ChristmasEve.jpg</src><caption>Present time</caption></image>

    <title>Christmas Day</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was strangely an average wake up call, 6:30am. Jessica was out of sorts, Ben and Katie were in hyper drive mode. First, we opened their presents from Father Christmas in their room.</p><ul><li><i>Katie</i>Katie hauled a Hannah Montana scooter, a whiteboard, a school register, some pens, books, a digital camera and a bath bomb factory set.
        </li><li><i>Ben</i>BMX bike, a Star Wars scooter, a Luke Skywalker figure, a Star Wars t-shirt, a digital camera.
        </li><li><i>Jessica</i>Upsy Daisy bubble bath, Upsy Daisy dressing up outfit, Pepper Pig blanket, Pepper Pig necklace, chocolate and an In the Night Garden annual.
        </li></ul><p>Next step, Mummy and Daddy's room, Daddy got a hoody, a pair of wellies, gardening gloves, sacatares, a hair brush and some sun dried tomatoes.</p><p>Mummy got a pair of jeans, some trainers, socks, banana chips and a nice pink fleece.</p><p>We then went down for a spot of additional Christmas present opening, this time from others. So many wonderful gifts.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_25-59-ChristmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Under the tree</caption></image><p>After breakfast we went over to the Fars for some more breakfast and more present opening, whilst Mummy went to church.</p><p>We then hot stepped it over to Istead Rise where the Elder's had already arrived. This year a change in plan, all the children had their traditional Christmas lunch first up, to allow the adults to have theirs in peace in the evening. After lunch and a walk around the block, another session of present opening. There were so many presents, it must have taken 20 minutes just to distribute them all. Let the commotion begin. It's like a box of fireworks being ignited. Wrapping paper flying everywhere.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_25-15-ChristmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Chimps Tea Party</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_25-71-ChristmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Present Mainia</caption></image><p>There was an hour or so, to play with some of the toys whilst we had the nightmare sleeping arrangements. How do you fit 12 people into a house with 3 bedrooms? We managed it just.</p><p>Later in the evening we had our Turkey dinner which was excellently prepared by chef Weston, played a quiz game, then settled down to watch Gavin and Stacey and the Catherine Tate show.</p>

    <title>Boxing Day</title>
    <info>
		<p>We returned home and had a bit of time to clear and play with some of the toys, before going to the Elders for the Barnett Boxing Day party. The usual crowd were there which was nice. It was girls against boys in the games stakes, and the boys slightly edged it and were the victors. Katie was allowed to stay up all night and join in as well. She was ever such a good girl and played nicely. Ma ma decided to play a trick, everyone was in it, except for the unfortunate target, Daddy. Daddy and Michael had to put a funnel down their trousers and try and drop a carrot from their head into the funnel. However, Ma ma had other ideas, and just as they were starting she poured water in to the funnel and Daddy's trousers and pants were soaked! Katie found it hard to keep a straight face through out this whole charad and was in hysterics after the deed had been done. Very amusing indeed! Thanks to Ellie and Michael for being sporting hosts.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_26-05-BoxingDay.jpg</src><caption>Pass the Parcel</caption></image>

		<p>Over the past couple of days we are still trying to find homes for all the presents. We also have been playing with them. Daddy and Ben have made a couple of lego sets, an Indiana Jones and a Star Wars. Ben is getting quite good at following the instructions and piecing together the small bricks. Katie and Mummy have been playing many games, making bath bombs and apple juice lollies. Jessica has been adoring her pepper pig teddy bear and books.</p><p>Today, Uncle Peter hosted the Barnett clan, plus the Rout's came along to. It was manic with 8 children under 7 years old running around the house. The children played some games, but mainly played all together with alot of energy!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_28-08-PeterBarnettXmasParty.jpg</src><caption>What a fine three</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2009/2009_12_28-34-PeterBarnettXmasParty.jpg</src><caption>Party!</caption></image>

		<p>The Elders again hosted another event, this time with the Sanders and Glidewells. We had some party games for the Children, including Mr and Mrs, a picture quiz and pass the parcel. In Mr and Mrs, Katie admitted she prefered Father Christmas to Daddy! Later in the evening we played more games and boys ended up victorious. Katie wouldn't sleep so she also stayed up. The 'funnel' trick was played on Richard who took it very well. The food was excellent. We sang in 2010.

    <info>
		<p>We have not seen as much snow as we've got now. It started falling on Tuesday and with the sub-zero temperatures it has remained ever since. Daddy worked from home on Wednesday. We have been off school since then as well.</p><p>During the week we have ventured out, although we've not lasted more than an hour, before one of us gets too cold and upset. We've done a bit of sledging which we have all enjoyed, we've also camped out in the three igloos that have been built around the estate. Daddy has also built a large snowman in the front garden.</p><p>Today, Katie's party she was going to attend was cancelled, so in the afternoon we went over to vist Auntie Susan and Graham. We took the sledges and went down the hill in the park at the back of their house. The Fars came to and also hurtled down the slope. Mummy spent most of the time slipping over on the ground!</p><p>After a cup of tea, we continued our journey to the swimming pool in Wokingham. Again good time was had by all even though Mummy and Daddy thought the water was a little cold!</p><p>On our way home we popped into the supermarket to do some shopping for Great Grandma and Grandad. It's too slippery for them to safely go out of the house.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_01_09-14-Sledging.jpg</src><caption>Auntie Susan V Ben and Farmor</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_01_09-31a-Sledging.jpg</src><caption>Ben and Farfar</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_01_06-15-SnowedAtHome.jpg</src><caption>Ben and Farfar</caption></image>

First her best friend, Leah Somner's at Wizzy World. It was manic inside and out. There was an 1.5 hour queue just to get back to the B and Q roundaout! Daddy and us three went in a played. We had a great time.</p><p>We then rushed to Leah Rushforth's house for her fairy party. A different party where they did art and craft stuff.</p>

		<p>After church, we headed over to the Fars and played lego for a bit.</p><p>In the afternoon we went to the Devil's Punchbowl near Hindhead, just for a walk, something that Ben wasn't really looking forward to. He just wanted to go back to Brooklands to the stunt track. Anyway we took the scooters and went for a nice, muddy walk. The views were good. We lasted just over an hour. Ben commented it's just 'full of nature' in his exuberant manner. All the children loved it, we could feel the cobwebs blowing off us. A thoroughly good walk.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_01_24-03-DevilsPunchbowl.jpg</src><caption>Little devils</caption></image>

    <title>Swimming, Freya's 5th Birthday, Katie over at Ma Ma's, Elders over to stay</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went over to Woking swimming pool and met up with Ma Ma, Pop Pop and the Elder clan. I think it was Jessica's first go on the flumes and she loved it. Of course Ben wanted to live in the flumes, Katie of course won't go near them.</p><p>We had to quickly rush off to Freya's 5th birthday party at the Arena leisure centre. There was a huge inflatable assault course, party games and customary party meal.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_01_30-21-FreyaBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Freya blowing the candles out</caption></image><p>Meanwhile, we left Katie with Ma Ma and Pop Pop who were having a girls day back in Istead Rise along with Lily.</p><p>
        In the afternoon Daddy went to watch Chertsey put in a good performance over in Cove. Highlights

    <title>Tremears Sunday Lunch, Church Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning the boys watched Andy Murray in the Final of the Austrlian Open and went for a bike ride, whilst the girls went to pick up Lily and Katie. Ben's has only just learnt to ride without stablizers on his new bike he got for Christmas. Unfortunately it is a bit big for him, and he can't touch the floor without falling over. His cycle helmet was proving a little bit of a hindrance as well. As it is a little large it was falling over his face. He was sometimes riding blind, proved by the fact he went straight into a concrete bollard, and sometimes used the gaps in the top of the helmet to see out of! He provided plenty of comedy.</p><p>Daddy cooked a lamb styled gyros with Chocolate Torte for Auntie Susan and Graham who came over for lunch. We all played Lego in the afternoon. Graham made a good spaceship, whilst Jessica and Susan were having a whale of a time.</p><p>In the early evening we went to the church fair where we played games and quizzes. Great Grandma, Grandad and Uncle Peter were all there too.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_01_31-01-TremearsElders.jpg</src><caption>Action Packed Day</caption></image>

    <title>Chertsey T V Whitley Bay, Cinema</title>
    <info>
		<p>Whilst Ben went to Elisha's disco birthday party at the school with Mummy, the rest of us went over to the Fars for a spot of playtime and lunch.</p><p>In the afternoon, Mummy, Kaite and Ben went with Ellie and Lily to the cinema to watch Princess and the Frog. The other halves went to watch the mighty Chertsey play Whitley Bay in the 5th round of the FA Vase, which ended up 1-1 after extra time. It was good to see some old faces amongst the 617 crowd. Joey and Jessica didn't think too much of it though.</p><p>In the evening we played a 'Friends' TV show game.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_02_06-11-CheryseyWhitleyBay.jpg</src><caption>Chertsey under lights...</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_02_06-98-CheryseyWhitleyBay.jpg</src><caption>Chertsey under lights...</caption></image>

    <title>Katie sleepover at Leah's, Daddy at Whitley Bay</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy went with Farfar on a very long train trip up to Whitley Bay to see Chertsey play in the FA Vase 5th round replay. Poor Farfar was feeling a little sick. We got there with plenty of time to spare. There was a huge crowd, 1080 supporting Whitley, about 20 supporting Chertsey! It was a really close, entertaining, chances at either end match. Unfortunately we lost 2-1.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_02_13-01-WaterlooBridgeLookingEast.jpg</src><caption>Quick snap from Waterloo Bridge as we cross on a bus</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_02_13-04-WhitleyBayChertsey.jpg</src><caption>Just look at the crowd</caption></image><p>Katie was very excited about the prospect of sleeping over at Leah's house. She is her best friend, and the first time she's slept over. There were four bags of stuff, most of them toys to take over. Anyway they stayed up till 11pm!</p>

    <title>Woburn Safari Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>It is half term Daddy had some time off. It is still bitterly cold outside, however we decided to go up to Woburn Safari Park. I think there is more roadwork motorway mileage than clear stretches of road! Well we had some fun in the car going around to see the animals. There is Katie who worringly is getting increasingly more and more nervous around things. She was scared of the animals as we went round. 'Come on Dad we've seen this now', 'I'm bored of this animal', 'Stop opening the windows'. The last one is a reference to Daddy's attempt of humour and purposely winding her up.</p><p>Jessica on the other hand was absolutely loving it. I think because she has seen the animals in her books, she got a lot out of it, seeing them in real life. A special mention to the lion area. Fantastic. There must have been over a dozen lions all moving about, at one point there was a stand off and I bit of semi-serious fighting. We heard some small 'RRROOAARRRS' as well.</p><p>We of course got monkeys on our car, which Ben and Jessica loved and screamed in excitement. We had Katie on the other hand getting hysterical and pleading for us to move on. Oh you can imagine the atmosphere in the car!</p><p>We parked up and walked around the Walabies. Mummy tried this Australian accent, which sounded nothing like an Australian, but Katie was getting most annoyed. Daddy said he was starving hungry, and cheeky Katie replied 'Daddy you are not starving. You may be hungry, but you are not starving'. Cheeky little madam! There was an outdoor adventure play area, as well as a good indoor softplay. Jessica loved the sack slide. Daddy loved the vertical drop slide, and Mummy chickened out of the junior big slide!</p><p>We visited the Lemurs which made a horrendous racket, went into the petting zoo. Jessica is pretty confident with the animals around her. We finally ended up seeing the Penguins and Sea Lions. By this point snow was coming across horizontally, so we decided to head back.</p><p>The children went off to the Fars for an overnight stay, whilst Mummy and Daddy went for a late Valentine's Meal in Camberley. We got a phone call a little later. Katie was upset and homesick, so she came home for the night.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_02_16-29-WoburnSafariPark.jpg</src><caption>A family of monkeys!</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_02_16-12-WoburnSafariPark.jpg</src><caption>Competing Lions</caption></image>

    <title>Sleep over at Fars</title>
    <info>
		<p>We all three children were to have spent last night at the Fars but Katie got a bit wobbly and went home late but returned first thing in the morning. Earlier, we made heart shaped coaster mats with plastic beads that Farmor set hard for us with an iron. We also played colour mixing on the CBBC website. Lots of story books were read both in the evening and this morning.</p><p>After turning the house upside down during most of the morning, we went out in the pouring rain to Tescos for lunch. We then got stuck in a big traffic jam on the way back and had to get Auntie Susan, on the phone, to call Pine Ridge near Heatherside to say we would be late. We were going there for Ten Pin Bowling. We got there a half hour late but we did not lose our booking.</p><p>Farfar won of course but Ben and Farmor had the same score with Katie only five points behind, a close match. Jessica did not join in but was happy to run around the centre smiling at everyone. We got back to the Fars in mid afternoon and were collected by mummy and daddy who were told that all three children behaved very well with, as usual, no upsets.</p><p>We think the Fars, by the time they had cleared up their house, had had enough of noisy active children but we knew that they were happy to have shared twenty-four hours together.</p>

    <info>
		<p>In the afternoon we joined the Elders, minus Aunir Ellie, in a trip to the playground over at Brooklands. All the children enjoy it as it has a race track for the bikes and scooters. Katie also went on the BMX jumps. We had a game of football. Ben still doesn't quite grasp it. He spent half the time falling over the comparitively massive ball! Daddy also got a rocket for Christmas which we all tried out. It shot miles up into the air.</p><p>We got back, played for a bit and the Elders stayed overnight</p>

    <title>Karting, Come Dine With Me</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Daddy went for a 10km jog, first in a long, long time. After some lego action, Uncle Steven came around for a traditional Gay Saturday lunch. 2 Poached egg on fresh bread, bacon, sausages, baked beans, mushroom, cup of tea. The business.</p><p>Steven and Daddy went Go Karting with some distant-ish friends in Frimley. Daddy of course came first in all three races. Ben's keeper of the trophy. Daddy enjoyed the circuit, probably the quickest indoor circuit he's been on.</p><p>Auntie Charlotte came over and in the evening Mummy and Daddy went out for the first of the 'Come Dine With Me' challenges over at the Sanders. It was all very posh. A bit of sparkly and canopies to begin with followed by pumpkin soup, lamb and the pièce de résistance, chocolate fondant, which was done perfectly. A really good evening had by all.</p><p>... Well almost all. Katie for the second time now hasn't taken too kindly to being left without mummy being at home. She only went to bed for half an hour, out of the 5 hours that Mummy and Daddy were out. The poor Fars. This means that next week, Daddy is going to miss out on going to Uncle Richard's 60th do.</p>

    <title>Alice Teale's 3rd, Joey Elder's 5th Birthday Parties</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today we were luck enough to have two birthday parties. The first was over in rainy, windy, Dartford. Fortunaltey it was an indoor event at a small playgroup and softplay place. It was really quite quaint the setup. There were 12 children in total which was just about right. We all had a good laugh, especially when Daddy caught Mummy in the eye with one of the play pit balls! Katie and Ben won the musical bumps and Ben won an addtional prize for his dancing skills. A unique style which is hard to describe. It involves looking quite serious and moving the shoulders up and down.</p><p>After the party we popped over to Istead Rise and had a cup of tea at Ma Ma and Pop Pop's before directly going to Joey's party at the Country Market. It was a joint do with Isabella which is becoming tradition now. This year there was 'Jester Giggles' keeping the children entertained. The children of course enjoyed themselves.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_02_28-19-JoeyBday.jpg</src><caption>Katie Gay</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_02_28-29-JoeyBday.jpg</src><caption>Let 'em eat cake</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_02_28-37-JoeyBday.jpg</src><caption>Ben's dancing</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_02_28-04-JoeyBday.jpg</src><caption>Jessica and Uncle Michael sharing a laugh</caption></image>

    <title>Bedfont Lakes, Nirvana Spa</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy and Jessie went shopping first up, getting some bits for the latest DIY.</p><p>We had am early lunch then set off for Bedfont Lakes, somewhere recommended by a friend. It was a country park which meant a nice long walk, with a spot of playground action. It was pretty cold, but we had fun.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_03_06-31-BedfontLakes.jpg</src><caption>The family - loving Ben in the glasses</caption></image><p>Later in the afternoon, Mummy went with Caroline and Sarah to Nirvana Spa, where she had a chance to relax and forget about it all. Daddy loved the opportunity to bath, read, play games and put us all to bed. Mummy couldn't help herself and even though mobile phones are banned she couldn't help phoning from the toilets like a naughty school girl!</p><p>This week we learnt how to play Cluedo and beat Daddy twice. We got how to play it and don't need any help. We all love it.</p><p>Also this week Mummy and Daddy went to parents evening at Cross Farm. Katie's report was that she was a little quiet, socialable, good at story writing and reading. The handwriting and maths were average, but could do with a little more care and to slow down.</p><p>Katie's spellings this week included: Doubtless, Expressionless, Effortless, Breathless, Homeless, Fearless. Katie could spell them by the end of the week which was pretty impressive we think. However, it is a struggle to get Katie to do her homework, especially the Maths. Saying that, she does get quite a bit and we find it difficult to fit it in during the evening.</p><p>Ben, also had a glowing report. He was reported to be very good at Maths, very helpful in the classroom. He is eager to learn. A very bright button in deed. He's quite happy to do his homework, and finds reading quite easy.</p>

    <info>
		<p>In the morning Daddy and Jessica quickly went around to the Fars to borrow their computer. Ours has broken... for good. It was a little battle weary.</p><p>We were then pretty much dragged out of the house by Mummy and Daddy to Sunningdale.... and thank goodness they did. We went to the best playground ever. We also played Pooh sticks and went for a little walk. Ben was testing us all as went close to the edge of the stream bank. He was surely not going to fall in again! No.</p><p>After a quick lunch Mummy took Ben to Cross Farm school for Alice's birthday, whilst us girls went with Daddy to watch Chertsey play football. Here is Katie's account in list form:</p><ul><li>Went with Daddy to Chertsey (had to be corrected as I kept calling them Chelsea!)</li><li>Sneaked up on Farfar</li><li>Had some crisps!</li><li>Walked around pitch</li><li>Getting thirsty. Wanted water</li><li>Half time. Had water and cake and chocolate</li><li>Walked around ground</li><li>Stopped with Farfar</li><li>Got home</li></ul><p>In the evening Daddy cooked some dinner as the Wests came over. A nice evening.</p>

    <title>Mothers Day - Monument</title>
    <info>
		<p>Both Katie and Ben have been making such a big thing of Mother's Day this year. We have been making pictures and sticking them all around Mummy's bedroom. We have also made lots of cards.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_03_14-00-MothersDay</src><caption>Mothers Day parafanalia</caption></image><p>Ben got up at 6:15, and asked to make breakfast in bed for mummy. Daddy did, and we opened the presents up in bed. After a double church service, we drove up to London. It was a sunny day. First we went up the Monument. We enjoyed going up and down the stairs more than experiencing the views!</p><p>We then went for a little walk along the Thames with our scooters. We had a whale of a time terrorizing the peadestrians.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_03_14-46-Monument.jpg</src><caption>Katie Scootering</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_03_14-50-Monument.jpg</src><caption>Ben Scootering</caption></image>

		<p>Daddy was at work so we went to Ma Ma and Pop Pops to pick up Ben and to take part in the sport relief mile. We all ran except for Jessica who was pushed in the buggy by Mummy. We managed to run for most of it. Ben kept complaining his hip was hurting at times. At the end the Mayor gave everyone a medal and goody bag. Jess was well pleased with her medal. After the race we went for a picnic by the river.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_03_21-SportReliefNewspaper.jpg</src><caption>Gravesend Messenger - Newspaper</caption></image>

    <title>Tri Lakes</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy had the day off work. After taking Katie and Ben to school, Mummy, Daddy and Jessica went to Tri Lakes, as Jessie is always bery excited about seeing farm animals. It was a very nice walk around the lakes, although Jessica was on Mummy's shoulders for 90% of the circuit. She likes to try and meet the animals, however, as soon as the animals approach, the nervousnous descends and Jessica backs away.</p><p>We later had Hallemah around for tea. Mummy and Daddy tried to watch 'Blood Diamond' (a film), however it was too violent and switched it off after half an hour. It was only rated a 15!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_03_26-01-TriLakes.jpg</src><caption>Mummy and Jessica enjoying the sheep</caption></image>

    <title>Hampton Court to Kingston boat trip</title>
    <info>
		<p>There was an advert for free boat trips down the Thames which we took advantage of. We first drove to Hampton Court Palace and had a quick look around the free bits. Then got on the paddle boat and headed eastwards. We all loved playing about on the boat, probably to the determent of the other passangers. There was a lower deck which we had all to ourselves where we made up games. Mummy and Daddy forced us outside so we 'could enjoy the river views'. We spotted people's gardens, islands, boats people lived in and other vessels sailing down the river.</p><p>After half an hour we reached Kingston, got off and had our picnic and another chance for Katie and Ben to scooter. Ben is the absolute worst. He just doesn't look where he is going so others on the promenade have to dodge him rather than the other way around. He also tends to fall off alot.</p><p>We went in WHSmiths to look at childrens books and board games, before returning to the wharf for our return journey. The weather was just about OK. We did plenty of walking.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_03_27-20-ThamesBoatTrip.jpg</src><caption>Scooter terrorizer at Hampton Court Palace</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_03_27-26-ThamesBoatTrip.jpg</src><caption>Picnic at Kingston</caption></image>

		<p>In the morning Daddy and Jessica spent time with the Fars, whilst Mummy, Ben and Katie participated in the Easter Workshop held at church. Mummy manned the stained glass window station. Ben and Katie made some Eater bits and bobs which they were very proud of. We all came back and after Ben danced to the 'Conker' song, known to the rest of us as 'Conga'!</p><p>We then headed west to Polesden Lacey (NT) where there was an Easter Egg hunt. Of course there were certain members of our group who were very excited whilst going around the grounds looking for eggs. We then played ball games on the lawn afterwards. We didn't actually get very near the house at all!</p>

		<p>Katie, Ben and Daddy cycled through the muddy woods to the Fars house. Unfortunately Katie, when racing down the first hill, fell off. Crash, slap, thud, arrgghh. A bump on the head for her troubles. Anyway after a certain amount of trashing of the Fars house, we cycled back without incident.</p><p>In the afternoon we went over to the Sanders to drop off Evie's Easter present, went to the playground and then made pastry cakes, before we played board games in the evening.</p>

		<p>In the morning Daddy spread horse poo around the garden much to the dismay of Mummy.</p><p>We then headed to the highest point in Surrey, Box Hill, where we met up with the Sanders to participate in the Cadbury's Easter Egg trial. Within 5 minutes all three children were muddy, and that's whilst we were sorting ourselves out.</p><p>Although we were at Box Hill, we could have been in any woods, as we didn't go up or down or see any views! It started quite muddy, but re-assured when a passer by said it'll get better. Well it didn't. We had fun solving the clues and Mummy got the key phrase impressively early on.</p><p>It took an hour or so to get around. We then had a nice picnic. The children all went off to play.

    <title>Roald Dahl Children's Gallery, Home Of Rest For Horses</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was time for us to take Ma Ma out for her annual Mothers day outing. It has become tradition for the day to have a horsey theme, but Mummy is running out of places to take her. In the end Mummy googled horse sanctuaries and the nearest was in Buckinghamshire. She also found out that the Roald Dahl childrens gallery is close by and Katie and Ben are great fans of his books so this seemed a good idea. In typical Mummy fashion she hadn't bothered to check out the directions and we ended up in Reading. We eventually arrived in Ayelsbury at midday, then could not find the museum and we had to lugg the kids round and round the town centre, eventually we found it but were then told you have to book time slots! This day was not going well, five hungry fed up children. However we booked a one 0 clock slot, Mummy and Katie went and got the picnic from the car and then we sat in the lovely sunshine in the gardens of the museaum and had a yummy picnic with the kids running round having fun. We went into the museum and it was very good. There was a giant peach, fantastic Mr fox's den to crawl in, the twits house and lots of fun things to do. After this we drove towards the horse santuary but again we had no idea how to get there, luckily a passer by gave some good instuctions. After stopping at a great park we got to the horses with 20 minutes until it shut. It was a lovely place with lots of retired police and military horses that were huge. There was about 70 stables with horses in and beatuiful paddocks. Ma ma and the children loved it.</p>

		<p>Last night we had Katie's best friend, Leah Sumner to stay. They get along very well together, and she is such a nice girl, we're really pleased Katie has a good friend. Anyway they stayed up until gone 11pm, sleeping downstairs in the camp they had made. Katie didn't like sleeping downstairs without an adult, so dragged Mummy to sleep on the sofa, then later got on the sofa with her.</p><first name="katie">In the morning Daddy took Katie for her first rollerskating experience at the Arena. After a wobbly start Katie found her rythem and managed to go up and down 25m without slipping over. She loved it and wants to go again.</first><p>On this fine, sunny day we cycled over to the Garden Of Eden swings for some playtime. Daddy and Ben played football. Jessica embarrassingly, lifted her dress and went to the toilet in the middle of the playground. Shocking. Luckily no one else saw.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_04_10-07-GardenOfEden.jpg</src><caption>Our bike ride</caption></image>

    <title>Frimley Park 10km - Sophie Ann 5th Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Richard came around to take Daddy to the Frimley Park Hospital 10km run. He met up with Michael who sits next to him at work and who never has gone close to a 10km run.... so  he should come 1st out of these 3. Wrong. Very wrong. Michael completed the course in a staggering 43 minutes, which is so unfair, but Richard also pipped Daddy in the last mile to finish a second quicker than Daddy! I know it's not fair. Daddy hadn't posted a bad time at 55 minutes, but Richard's training paid off as he re-joined Daddy at about the 9km marker. The final kilometer was a had fought affair between the two. Richard overtook Daddy in the final 100 metres in a sprint finish. Very exciting!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_04_11-MartinRichardFrimleyPark10km.jpg</src><caption>Nothing between Daddy and Richard</caption></image><p>We all watched along with Karen and Evie. They came around after for a drink. They couldn't quite believe the result. Well done Richard.</p><p>In the afternoon Ben wanted Daddy to take him to Sophie Ann's birthday party held at her house. There were 9 girls and just 3 boys. Ben was a little shy and didn't mix with the other children much. Initially he said he didn't want to be there. However, he warmed up and enjoyed winning some sweets. They are all his class mates, but he has his two favourites: Joey and Oliver. Outside of that he's not interested. Katie is a little more socialable.</p><p>We all met up at Frimley Lodge Park and played cricket and football. The playground was being re-built.</p><p>Ben was asking if he keeps breathing, then will he run out of breath. Then he asked if air goes into my body then where does it go? Is the air we breathe dirty? He was thinking through all the answers and coming up with very logical follow up questions. He's a little bright button.</p>

    <first name="benjamin">Splinter</first>
    <info>
		<p>Ben was squeeling like a girl, before hand. 'I'm not a brave boy'... 'No Daddy'. Daddy cleared the room, tussled with Ben who was told it would hurt more if he struggled. Anyway he momentarily calmed down. Daddy pierced the skin at the base of Ben's thumb, then got the tweesers and slid the  splinter out. Done in about 5 seconds. Ben then continued to make as much fuss afterwards even though he was fine for the delicate operation.</p>

I think those two were the only ones who were not Indians in the procession! After a spot of lunch in Gravesend town centre with Pop Pop, we headed over to Cascades for a swim.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_04_17-03-Vaisakhi.jpg</src><caption>A pair of Indians</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_04_17-11-Vaisakhi.jpg</src><caption>Pop Pop and Jessmunda</caption></image><p>Ben of course wanted to go on the flumes, and Katie was hesitant at first, but later went down. Jessica loved playing on the smaller slides.</p><p>We popped back to Istead Rise for a cup of tea, before heading to Tatsfield to lay some flowers on Great Nan and Pop Pop's grave. A beautiful area.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Our now annual trip to Drayton Manor was upon us. We left early and arrived at opening time. Everybody, including Jessica was looking forward today. As we arrived we saw thousands of girl guides, brownies and rainbows. A gathering to celebrate 100 of girl guiding. This did not please mummy as she feared that the 8,000 strong congregation were going to clog up the queues. However, it did not really effect our day. First stop, was of course Thomas Land. Ben just had to go on the rollercoaster first - Troublsome Trucks. The deal was to raise our hands. Meanwhile the ladies went on the aeroplane ride. We continued around Thomas Land, then headed over to the water tyre ride. We got wet!</p><p>We've worked out that Jessica is a bit of a thrill seeker which just sits right in the Gay family. Just Katie is a little scared of some of the rides.We continued around the park, and stopped for lunch over in Spencer's playground. The afternoon was more of the same. We tried to go on as much as possible. It was really nice that we all went on the rides, a real family day out. Ben's favourite was the shooting gallery, Katie's was the dragon rollercoaster, and Jessica just loved everything second. We exited at 6:15, went to our usual fish and chip shop, and made the 2.5 hour journey back home.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_04_24-16-DraytonManor.jpg</src><caption>Brave Ben on the Boats</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_04_24-24-DraytonManor.jpg</src><caption>Hubba Hubba</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_04_24-84-DraytonManor.jpg</src><caption>Jessica</caption></image>

		<p>Another early start. We parked up at Stockwell, caught a bus and the tube to Canary Wharf where we were presented with a wall of noise and support for all the runners. We looked out for cousin David who was due around the time we were there. Unfortunately we didn't see him. We loved the atmosphere and had huge admiration for all the runners.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_04_25-00-LondonMarathon.jpg</src><caption>David Dixon</caption></image><p>We had a picnic at Cabbot Square, then caught the DLR to South Quays where it was a little less crowded. Katie, and particularly Jessica, loved spotting all the fancy dress joggers who went passed. We stayed for about an hour, then headed home.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_04_25-29-LondonMarathon.jpg</src><caption>Benny in his tram tshirt which used to be Daddy's</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_04_25-23-LondonMarathon.jpg</src><caption>Underground Motion</caption></image>

    <title>Surrey Heath Show - Lulworth and Durdle Door</title>
    <info>
		<p>After SkateJam at Tomlinscote School, the Elders came over and we went to the Surrey Heath show down at Frimley Lodge Park. We all came back and played games.</p><p>Daddy headed on a motorbike trip down to the seaside, stopping at Wareham and then onto Lulworth Cove. The tide was out and the beach towards Durdle Door was pretty empty, so it almost seemed like some paradise, private beach with picturesque views.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_01-08-Lulworth.jpg</src><caption>Durdle Door</caption></image>

    <title>Long Run - Shopping - Swimming</title>
    <info>
		<p>Early in the morning Daddy went running with Auntie Ellie around the woods in Chawton and Four Marks. A total of 7.5 miles in about 1hr 15mins!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_02-MartinEllieJogRoute-Chawton12.2km.jpg</src><caption>Daddy and Auntie Ellie's Jog Route</caption></image><p>After homework and lunch we went off to Tesco's to do a shop for the 'Come Dine With Me' which we are hosting this weekend. Daddy managed to bump into Max, a school friend last seen at Ravenscote (25 years ago). He's doing very well for himself, working in the city and living in Croydon.</p><p>We then went swimming at the Arena. We believe we need to get Ben back into swimming lessons again. It's about time he lost those armbands. Jessica is fearless in the water. She loves going down the slide as fast as possible.</p>

		<p>Daddy replaced a patch of the front lawn with some turfs which don't look like they have too much life in them! We just hope they survive.</p><p>In the afternoon we walked / biked down to Frimley Lodge Park and me up with the Fars briefly. The weather was quite changable. We played football and in the secret hide out. They are still rebuilding the playground. The Fars also treated us to some bits in the cafe aftrwards.</p><p>Later Daddy went off with Uncle Michael for some serious mountain biking near Peaslake. We climbed Holmbury Hill and managed some downhill biking. Daddy wasn't quite as skillful as the other seasoned bikers.</p>

    <title>Skate Jam, Christian Aid collecting, Swimming and Come Dine With Me</title>
    <first name="katie">Lost first tooth, middle, bottom.</first>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning the team split: Daddy, Katie and Ben went to Skate Jam at Tomlinscote. Ben was quite good, managing to keep his balance, although it was pretty difficult as the smallest skates were size 12 and he's only an 8! He did well. Katie continued by skating well. Not sure Ben wants to continue with it. When we finished we walked to the Fars house. They were out. We climbed their tree in the front garden. Ben is like a monkey! Meanwhile Mummy and Jessica stood outside 'Focus' with a tin collecting for Christian Aid. The weather was cold and wet.</p><p>In the afternoon Mummy wanted to get on with preparing for the Come Dine With Me this evening. So Daddy took Jessica and Ben swimming at a packed Farnborough swimming pool, we also dropped off a pink birthday card for Barrie!</p><p>Come 7pm and the first guests arrived and were greeted by Katie who was hired as a waitress. 'Welcome to the best restaurant. My name is Katie and I'm your waitress for the evening'. That has to be worth a point or two! We had seven adult guests and three children, so a full house.</p><p>Katie's tooth wobbled out at about 7:30pm. The first child in the family to lose one. This seemed to affect her. She needed some re-assurance that it was not the end of the world. She managed to earn £1.50 from the tooth fairy and a £1 for waitressing. She eventually went to bed at about 10pm.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_08-07-ComeDineWithMe.jpg</src><caption>Toothless Wonder</caption></image><p>Our ploy was to get everyone drunk so they could be more liberal with the scoring and try not to taste the food too much. Saying that Mummy did very well. We started with mummy's French Onion Soup, followed by Chicken Basque and ended with Daddy's Chocolate Torte. There weren't too many disaters. Just Mummy left cling film on top of the ciabatta bread when she put it in the oven!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_08-20-ComeDineWithMe.jpg</src><caption>The ladies before poisoning</caption></image><p>After dinner, we retired and had a great laugh with a wide range of topics of conversations, from the gory bits of Charlotte's nursing job to child birth and cracked nipples! We ended about midnight. The Elders and Charlotte stayed over.</p>

		<p>In the morning Ben and Daddy joined Joey and Michael for a spot of MotoX over at Four Marks. The track had been done up and was dry. Daddy went on the main track for the first time. He wasn't happy at his performance. It was quite technical and physically and mentally tiring. Later we went in the woods over the back which was fun. There were a couple of teenagers who were literally flying in the air over the jumps and a couple of more mature chaps who got really stuck in some mud.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_09-04-MotoX.jpg</src><caption>Kid flying high</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_09-64-MotoX.jpg</src><caption>On the pull</caption></image><p>Meanwhile the rest of us went to church where Ma Ma and Pop Pop saw Katie doing church parade with Rainbows.</p><p>In the afternoon Charlotte and the Elders came over as well and we all had a go at Ten Pin Bowling at Farnborough.

    <title>May Fair - Lily Ballet - FA Cup Final</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the early part of the morning Daddy took Jessica on a long, long bike ride basically around the firing range. Starting from our house, down the Red Road to Bisley and then back along the Basingstoke canal. I think Jessica enjoyed herself. She was pretty quiet and very polite if asked if she was having a good time. Daddy wonders how comfortable a ride it must be at the back being bounced around, starring into Daddy's back. Anyway, Daddy under estimated the length of ride, running late, we powered home, meeting mummy on her way down to the school.</p><p>The annual May Fair, this year Ben was debuting. He said that skiping was easy and was very matter a fact about it. The facts were he was the worst 'skipper' in town. It was his turn, and he was so proud and happy to be showing off to us and the crowd. He beamed, the Benny smile continously throught the performance. We couldn't help but be elated for his hapiness and the fact he thought he was good at skipping.</p><p>Katie later did a more complicated routine which involved platting the ribbons on the pole. There was quite a following for the Gay children. There was the Elder clan and all four grandparents, plus Uncle Peter.</p><p>Dadddy and Farfar left soon after for their trip to go and watch the FA Cup final at Wembley: Chelsea v Portsmouth. The first time either had been to watch a game at the new Wembley. The stadium was fantastic. 88,000 fans, half alloted to each of the teams, although the stadium bared blue at both ends. Farfar and Daddy sat high in the 'gods' section, pretty close to the half way line, above the royal box. The game itself was a little strange. Chelsea hit the woodwork 5 times in the first half, and a penalty miss from each of the sides. Chelsea had the class that told in the end. We stayed for the raising of the cup and then funneled back to the underground and home.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_15-11-FACupFinal.jpg</src><caption>Daddy and Farfar outside Wembley</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_15-18-FACupFinal.jpg</src><caption>Wembley and its infamous pitch</caption></image><p>Meanwhile, the rest of us went back to Alton to watch Lily perform in her ballet production. Jessica was showing enough interest for her to take up ballet when she is a little older.</p>

    <title>Over to the Wests</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning was jobs, jobs, jobs. First job was to fix the radiator which had been separated from the wall after Ben attempted to use it as a ladder in order to get to the coat rack!!! Luckily there was no leaking pipes. Other jobs included, fixing the leaking shower, fixing the bin shed and planting some flowers.</p><p>After church and Sunday lunch we ventured over to the West household for a play and natter. Old Harrison and Freya are growing up fast. They noted that Katie had grown quite a bit since the last time they saw her. Jessica spent most of the afternoon asleep, the other four played nicely in Freya's room. Ben and Katie had to comprehend the West rules of playing. Before starting on a new toy, you must first clear away the old toy. This was told to them by Freya. Good on Freya, perhaps she can come to our house and install some discipline into the children!</p>

		<p>Jessica had a suspected splinter. It was not an easy retrieval. How she wailed and fought Daddy. Daddy had to forcibly pin Jessica's hand down before attempting piercing the skin with a pin. Anyway blood was drawn, and we weren't sure if we got everything out. Jessica was a very good, brave girl and there was a special hug for Daddy at the end.</p>

		<p>In the morning Daddy, Jessica and Ben went over to the Fars to play where they met up with cousins Anne and Theresa. Our cousins sampled the whirlwind effect we have on the Fars house. We had the train set out, cream crackers and other toys booby trapped around the house! Meanwhile Mummy took Katie and her best friend Leah to Skate Jam.can  It was Leah's first attempt at rollerskating. Katie is getting more and more confident.</p><p>In the afternoon we ran the 'can shy' at the church fete at St. Andrews church. We all tried lots of things and had a good time in the sun.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_22-13-ChurchFete.jpg</src><caption>A butterfly eating ice cream</caption></image>

They saw the likes of Ernie Ells, Paul Casey, Luke Donald, Lee Westwood and Paul Broadhurst. Not too many birdies, but some cracking drives. They sat in the stand at the 14th which had a great view. No cameras though!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_23-02-WentworthGolf.jpg</src><caption>On the first at Wentworth</caption></image><p>In the afternoon Katie went to her friend's Oliver's birthday party.

    <title>Camping - Studland Bay</title>
    <info>
		<p>We soldiered down, the long way around to Studland Bay where we met up with the Elders and Glidewells. It was a baking hot day. We first played in the sand, attempting to build a river from the sea to the mound. After lunch and an ice cream there were trips on the Kayak. For some reason Uncle Michael vowed not to go on a Kayak with Daddy again. Not sure why. Anyway Daddy took Ben out to sea and over to the 'secret' beach and caves. Ben enjoyed the trip, taking it all in, anyway that's what we hope. Daddy get's the same sort of reaction when he takes the children on bike rides. You can never quite tell 100%.</p><p>We played a bit more on the beach, football and frisbee. Then Mummy, Daddy, Katie and Jessica all went on a pedalo. Mummy's efforts were feeble. I think we were going backwards more than forwards! We had fun. Katie and Mummy dived in the cold, cold water and waded back to shore.</p><p>We headed to the campsite in East Creech, late afternoon. The Elders tent was huge. Enough to sleep the 9 of us. Michael cooked up a scrummy BBQ, whilst us lot went to find a nice playground in the woods. The tyre swing was the most popular ride.</p><p>After dinner we played a bit more. Daddy was sent out to get some medicine for Ben. He wasn't feeling very well. No shops were open, in the end a car flashed daddy down, waving a medicine bottle out of the window. He'd overheard us looking for some Calpol and had some spare. Never too sure to accept it or not. Well we did and all was well. The children struggled to get to sleep as the adults played cards inside.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_30-04-StudlandBay.jpg</src><caption>Ben Kayaking with Jon and Rachel</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_30-11-StudlandBay.jpg</src><caption>Jessica coming out of the sea</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_30-17-StudlandBay.jpg</src><caption>Katie Kayaking with Jon and Rachel</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_30-35-StudlandBay.jpg</src><caption>Ben - Don't bury your head in the sand!</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_30-43-StudlandBay.jpg</src><caption>Katie</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_30-47-StudlandBay.jpg</src><caption>A civilized meal</caption></image>

    <title>Camping - Durdle Door</title>

Had a few games of 'Please mister crocodile'.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_31-114-DurdleDoor.jpg</src><caption>Thunderbirds are go</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_31-123-DurdleDoor.jpg</src><caption>Jessica running riot</caption></image><p>After a scrummy cooked breakfast we parted ways. The others were heading home, whilst we decided to make the most of our location and free time and pop across to Lulworth and Durdle Door.</p><p>The climb up the cliff was pretty hard in the heat, although the children all did very well in their attempts. We looked down onto Durdle Door which was quite a site. Mummy was fretting that we were getting too close to the edge.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_31-136-DurdleDoor.jpg</src><caption>Overlooking Lulworth Cove</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_31-140-DurdleDoor.jpg</src><caption>Overlooking Durdle Door</caption></image><p>We headed down to the beach, and had our picnic lunch. It was quite stoney. Although it was quite hot, the sea was blimin' freezing. Mummy and KAtie had to abort their swimming attempt. Daddy knew that if we were to continue over a rockpool 5 minutes on, then we would have the whole beach pretty much to ourselves, as well as being closer to the car for the return journey. We had a lovely stretch of sandy beach which only the occasional passer by interupted our private spot. We ventured over to the rock pools which were not populated by much wildlife. However, we had a good time searching.</p><p>By the time it was late afternoon we decided to head back. We were all pretty worn out. A good time had by all.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_31-155-DurdleDoor.jpg</src><caption>Katie</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_31-04-DurdleDoor.jpg</src><caption>Early morning call from Lily and Jessica</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_31-52-DurdleDoor.jpg</src><caption>Mermaids on the rocks</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_31-57-DurdleDoor.jpg</src><caption>Katie and Ben on the rocks</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_31-73-DurdleDoor.jpg</src><caption>Ben pulling Katie along our private beach</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_05_31-86-DurdleDoor.jpg</src><caption>Just one more photo...</caption></image>

    <title>Robin Hill - Isle Of Wight</title>
    <info>
		<p>Farmor was in Denmark, so Farfar suggested that we'd have a day out at Robin Hill on the Isle Of Wight. Mummy has always wanted to return back after a trip down here in her childhood. As it was quite a late decision there was quite a scamble to book ferry tickets, get a picnic and sort ourselves out. We made the 9:30 car ferry crossing. Farfar had gone by train and so caught a different boat across. It was quite funny because his Seacat overtook our slow, old boat. We could see each other waving.</p><p>We everntually all arrived (11am) at Robin Hill. The weather was fabulous, as Katie would say. First, we went on the train and pirate ship rides. There weren't many other people, so we got on first time. In fact we had 3 goes. The park was designed so you would follow a path around and after 50 yards or so there would be another attraction. There was a maze, mini village, plenty of adventure playgrounds, Troll Island and best of all a taboggen run. We barely fitted it all in. If only we had some more time. Katie and Ben said it was their best attraction park. Better than Thorpe Park, Chessington and Drayton Manor. The park was designed just right for them. It cost £33 for the 6 of us which was excellent value for money. It has persuaded us to maybe have our 2011 summer holiday on the Isle of Wight.</p><p>We left for our 4pm sailing back to the mainland. However, the boats were running an hour late we were told. So the boys and Katie went for a walk on to the jetty to splash our feet in the water. Half and hour later we got a phone call from Mummy to say she was on the boat that was currently docked. She'd been let on a boat half an hour earlier!  It meant the rest of us had to hurry and walk on to the boat. We were the last on, but thankfully made it in time. We had a good crossing back. Another lovely day.</p><p>In the evening Mummy went to see a Beach Boys tribute band with the Barnett clan.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_06_05-04-RobinHillIsleOfWight.jpg</src><caption>Where's the wally</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_06_05-10-RobinHillIsleOfWight.jpg</src><caption>Me hearties</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_06_05-38-RobinHillIsleOfWight.jpg</src><caption>Jessica from the 70's</caption></image>

    <title>Pirbright Scarecrow Fete</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we did some gardening and homework. In the afternoon Joey, Lily, Michael, Farmor and Farfar went with us to the Pirbright Fete, which was themed around scarecrows. There were 30 or so exhibits standing in the green. The main 'Gruffalo' unfortunately got burnt down the night before. All the scarecrows were themed mainly around children's characters. Our favourite was Peppa Pig I think. </p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_06_12-08-PirbrightScarecrowFete.jpg</src><caption>Peppa</caption></image><p>There was reportidly 3,000 people there. We couldn't quite see that, however it was very busy and quite hot. We each had a go on the horses. Katie, Ben and Lily loved it, whilst Jessica looked a little unsure and Joey didn't want to try. After watching the tug of war and an ice cream of course we ended the afternoon with a trip on the underground train. Good fun had by all.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_06_12-33-PirbrightScarecrowFete.jpg</src><caption>Jess the Jockey</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_06_12-39-PirbrightScarecrowFete.jpg</src><caption>Katie pleased with the ride</caption></image><p>Mummy then looked after us 5 children, whilst Daddy and Uncle Michael went around to Steven's house to watch England's opener against the USA. First time Daddy's seen Steve's big house in Reading. The game will be remembered for ITV putting on an advert break whilst Gerrard scored the first goal, and for the unfortunate goalkeeping mistake made by Robert Green! Us children watched it back at home, however after about 10 minutes we lost interest and mucked about amongst ourselves.</p>

    <title>Daddy work - Parish Lunch - Ten Pin Bowling</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was an early start as Daddy try to squeeze in a full day's overtime. Well what a cock up. Daddy made into the office for 6:30am, went to the toilet and locked himself out of the office! The motorbike keys and phone were all inside. So Daddy had to find someone, borrow their mobile phone (because Daddy's rubbish at mobiles) and ring us up at real early to get a lift back home. Ben was still asleep. So Daddy worked at home, until the next person was due into the office.</p><p>Later in the morning we had church parade, then Daddy finished work and joined us for the Parish lunch. The weather again was very kind. We all had our picnic on the lawn and played with Poppy and James. Grandma and Grandad were also there.</p><p>Later in the afternoon we went over to the Big Apple in Woking and had a game of Ten Pin bowling. Free tickets as Farmor had won them in the school raffle. It was a good game as we didn't need the ramp. Well the final scores were very close. Mummy and Daddy tied on 97 points, whilst Katie ended on 96! We all shared the Curly Wurly prize.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_06_13-03-BigAppleBowling.jpg</src><caption>Ben launching a big one</caption></image>

    <title>Jessica - Unconsious</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy and Jessica were walking to pick up Katie and Ben from school. Jessica ran in front then suddenly fell forward. A normal fall. Jessica screamed, Mummy sprinted to comfort her. Jessica then flopped into Mummy's arms and seemingly went unconsious for a matter of 20 seconds. In that time she seemed to fit as well. She began to go blue. Luckily there were people around as Mummy screamed for an ambulance and really paniced. Fortunately Jessica came around and she got the biggest cuddle from Mummy. They then went to the doctors surgery. They could not diagnose the problem. A really strange event. Maybe her body couldn't cope and couldn't breathe for a while. We'll never know. There has been no ill effect from it.</p>

    <title>Swimming Assesment, Denmark BBQ</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went off to Camberley for a swimming assessment for Katie. Apparently she swims well, but needs work on her leg action. Meanwhile the rest of us were having a great time on the swings.</p><p>In the afternoon Charlotte came over and we prepared for Daddy's Denmark Vs Cameroon BBQ. Daddy also took everyone biking. Jessica had her first go on Katie's old bike with stablizers. It was funny to see her do little tiny pedals. Ben was on the oversized BMX. He had to get the hang of setting off when he couldn't touch the floor too well. Crash, bang, wallop. We decided to go where there was more space, so we went over to the crescent. He was so proud, having a big smile on his face, looking at Daddy constantly and not where he was going! Another crash. A bit worse this time. The front wheel gave way on the shingle and the handlebar dug into his forehead. Blood spilling out as well as a few tears. Ben doesn't like plasters so he's going around with a bullet wound to his head.</p><p>In the evening we left Daddy at home and went over to Richard Barnett's 60th and retirement party. Meanwhile Daddy had: Barrie, James, Susan, Graham, Michael and Richard over to watch the Denmark game. Barrie got drunk and fell asleep. It was a good game, Denmark beating Cameroon 2-1.</p>

		<p>We awoke early not because the children were excited, but Mummy got us all up so we could watch her open her presents and cards... and as Brucey says, didn't she do well. We got her a black cardigan (that she wanted), a pink t-shirt, some make up, big sunglasses and jewelery. She also got some money, a new handbag and a trip to the Globe theatre to watch Henry VIII.</p><p>Pop Pop came across and watched Ben in his grandparents assembly. The Fars also went for the afternoon session when Katie done her piece.</p><p>In the evening we played party games, musical chair bumps and statues.</p>

    <title>RLC Army show</title>
    <info>
		<p>The Burrows came over for the RLC Show. We went over in the later morning and had fun on lots of things. Ben and Thomas get on really well. They are quite a like in their 'boy-ish-ness'. Both like a bit of rough and tumble and pretty vocal as well. We looked in some of the vehicles which were pretty big and menacing and watched a bit of tug of war. Even the adults had a sprint race and a go on the assault course. Ben and Katie had a go on the tight rope, where they hung and traversed across the rope, above the cold pool of water. The crowd were impressed, the parents proud. The BBQ beckoned.</p><p>The Elder clan came over and we went for a second stint at the show. Star of the show this time was Thomas' efforts in the boxing ring. Left, right, whammmooo. Even the other pretenders were at risk of getting the Burrows' right hander! Ben, very confident going onto the ghost train ride, was a little less sure of himself when he left the car. Katie took mummy on the speedy Twister ride. Unfortunately we ran out of time and missed the main show events. Still we had a great time on this baking hot day.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_06_26-21-RLCArmyShow.jpg</src><caption>Boxer Ben</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_06_26-43-RLCArmyShow.jpg</src><caption>Katie and Mummy on Twister</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_06_26-63-RLCArmyShow.jpg</src><caption>Monkey boy Ben</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_06_26-46-RLCArmyShow.jpg</src><caption>The Krew</caption></image>

    <title>Ben - Parents Evening</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today Mummy and Daddy went into see Ben's teacher, Mrs King for a progress report on the year. She couldn't be any more glowing in all aspects of Ben. He's clever, attentive, respectful, helpful and has surpassed what a reception year child should attain this year, which is quite remarkable given his parentage and he's the youngest in the class. Apparently Mrs King, who is heavily pregnant, told the headmistress that if she had a boy she would want him to just be like Ben. She has not obviously seen Ben get in a bad mood! Still Mummy and Daddy are immensely proud. A comment from Mrs King was that he soaks up what he's been told like a sponge. Something we've noticed as well. Well done 'Big Boy'.</p>

We went over to Runnymede to the park next to the river. We had a great time. We took the bikes and Daddy took us girls on a ride up the river to Staines.

Laura had volunteered to run the school stall at the very time the procession slithers down the main room.</p><p>The theme was sports from around the world. Cross Farm choose American Football. Katie went as a cheerleader and Ben as an American Football player. Bean bags for shoulder pads, a cycle helmet and some black paint! It was blisteringly hot.</p><p>There was so many family and friends that came to watch. That's what the children like the most, spotting people they know in the crowd. Anyway they proceeded through Frimley Green which took about half an hour.</p><woops woopstitle="Ben Landing On His Face" rating="5"><p>After, we went to the green where there was a fair, it was very busy. We all went on the big inflatable slide. Daddy told Ben to bounce his way down to get more of a thrill. He managed to bounce so much, he did a forwards sommersault during his descent. The 'man' told Ben off. Mummy told Daddy off!</p><center><object width="500" height="405"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/6eI7J2ZSdiw&amp;amp;hl=en_GB&amp;amp;fs=1?border=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/6eI7J2ZSdiw&amp;amp;hl=en_GB&amp;amp;fs=1?border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="500" height="405"></embed></object></center></woops><p /><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_07_11-12-FrimleyGreenCarnival.jpg</src><caption>Cross Farm float</caption></image>

She was so tiny and cute. Mummy and Daddy wanted another baby! Steve and Joyce were taking it all in their stride and doing a fine job.

Farfar's childhood friend, Jamie Leicester was there driving one of the engines which was nice to see.</p><p>We went on two long trips around the track. All enjoyed it. We must have spent over 3 hours there.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_07_18-33-CockrowRailway.jpg</src><caption>Jessica training</caption></image>

    <title>Katie and Ben Commended from School</title>
    <info>
		<p>The year's commendations were handed out today. One for each class in the school. We couldn't be prouder parents, Ben won a certificate for his class and Katie for hers. It is such a great feat to be chosen out of your 30 class mates to be the one that is commended. To get both children coming top of their respective classes makes as extremely proud. Well done Katie and Ben.</p>

    <title>Katie's 7th Birthday - Jacob's 6th Birthday Party - Harrison's 3rd Birthday Party - Oliver's 7th Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was birthday's day. Katie was prohibited from opening too many presents in the morning as we waited for Daddy to return from the airport. Grandma, Grandad, Peter, Ma Ma and Pop Pop all came around early to give Katie her presents.</p><p>Katie was also allowed to open her main present from Mummy and Daddy which was a pair of rollerskates, so we could go off to SkateJam at Tomlinscote. Meanwhile the Fars took Jessica and went off to Terminal 5 to pick up Daddy. Daddy was so pleased to see his Jessica.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_07_24-10-KatieHarrisonBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Our 7 year old</caption></image><p>We all returned home and opened the rest of the presents. We did not have much time as Daddy and Jessica went over to the West's for Harrison's 3rd Birthday. It was nice to see them, and see Duncan whom we haven't seen for ages. His girlfriend made the most amazing Thomas The Tank Engine birthday cake. We also enjoyed the Farnborough Airshow, seeing the Vulcan and Red Arrows. Jessica and Harrison were getting on like a house on fire. Laughing at each others observations. It was so cute to see.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mummy, Katie and Ben went to Jacob's 6th Birthday Party. Not a person we know that well. He just invited everyone that is in his class, plus siblings and parents. Now this was an amazing party at Frimley Lodge House. First off there was an outbuilding with a swimming pool inside which the children enjoyed. There was an inflatable slide, a go-karting track and they had hired outside caterers to feed the children and adults. It was quite amazing.</p><p>Later we went up to Pine Ridge for Oliver's Ten-Pin bowling party.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_07_24-37-KatieHarrisonBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Jessica and Harrison enjoying a moment</caption></image>

    <title>Hayling Island Camping - Geocaching</title>
    <info>
		<p>We got to the Oven campsite, Hayling Island, put up our tent easily with the help of Auntie Ellie. We had brought all the bikes and all the children were happy cycling around the field while we awaited Ma Ma's arrival, funnily enough she got lost! Once Ma Ma arrived we had some lunch and headed for the onsite pool. It was still lovely and warm as we had remembered from 3 years ago. However, this time after having a lovely swim we all got out and found the pool had taken all the colour from our costumes! We all decided not to go in again. We had an ice cream and then headed to the beach. We intended to do some of Auntie Ellies new hobby geocaching (searching for treasure boxes) but the children wanted to skinny dip in the sea. Auntie Ellie cooked a lovely curry for tea.</p>

    <info>
		<p>came down today and we decided to go on the Hayling Billy, a train that runs on the front, to the swing park. We had to walk in the end as we had just missed the train. The children all had a nice time on the swings and we got the train back. We then played on the beach. Katie, Ben and Joey all went in the sea with Mummy. It was so warm in there! We were then allowed two goes on the fun fair. In the evening Pop Pop came for a BBQ and we sang some songs around the fire!</p>

    <title>Hayling Island Camping - Beach 2</title>
    <info>
		<p>Auntie Karen, Lynne, Rachel and Evie came to visit us today. We went to the other end of the beach this time to the other swing park. There was also a beach volleyball court there and the kids loved playing throwing and catching the ball over the high net. Auntie Sue and Uncle Richard came for another little visit. After, we went to an old railway line and all cycled along. There was also a bmx track which the older ones loved. Ben has become so confident at cycling. He could barely cycle before he went but can now do it fine, just needs a bit more practice at breaking! Jessica has also learnt the art of pushing the pedals all the way around, 360 degreees, rather than 180 and going back. We also all took a present from a geocache box we found and put one back.</p>

    <title>Katie and Ben Joint Birthday Party - Evie 1st Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went over to the Sanders for Evie's first birthday. All the christening guests were there. Nice to see so many travel from Derby and Kent.</p><p>Later in the afternoon it was Katie and Ben's joint birthday party at Tomlinscote School. We decided on a joint party this year not only for financial reasons, but time was an issue and the fact they quite enjoyed to have the same sort of party. First off was some football, then musical statues, then we moved into the gym where a load of aparatus was out which was made into a circuit for us to go around. The favourite item was the rope swing.</p><p>We then went for some party food and a birthday cake where the candles couldn't be blown out.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_07_31-47-KatieBenBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Blowing the candles out</caption></image>

    <title>Dixons Over</title>
    <info>
		<p>Our 2nd cousins, the Dixons came up from Deal to come for a Gay BBQ. Reuben, now 20 months has grown beyond belief, speaking, walking, could be mistaken for a 2.5 year old. He was calling Daddy, 'Man'. Yasmin played so nicely with all three of us.</p><p>Whilst the BBQ was slowly grilling away we went over to play football. Katie, sporting her new boots impressed us all with her enthusiasm and skills. Jessica wasn't in her sharing mood when it came to her bike, and Ben was rooted to being goalkeeper at the wrong end of the pitch!</p><p>The food just really never came, the coffee was out of date, thank goodness the Tremear's brought some nice homemade puddings. Ben showed off how good at crashing his bike he was!</p><p>It so nice for us all to meet up, just a shame in some respects that there was such a comotion with all the children. All five kiddies ended up in the nudey pants in the backgarden!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_08_01-06-DixonsOver.jpg</src><caption>Jessica and Yasmin</caption></image>

    <title>Ben's 5th Birthday - Legoland</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had a bright start today. Ben opened his presents which were revolved pretty much all alround Star Wars. He got a storm troopers helmet from Uncle Howard, some figures from Auntie Karen and Uncle Barrie, a ball, a book and a Star Wars T-Shirt. He got a football goal, a scooter and a scooby doo board game to name but a few things.</p><p>After opening his presents we then proceeded to the main event of the day which was a trip to Legoland. Woo Hoo. We got there before the opening time at 9:30 and waited till the gate was raised. We rushed to the dragon rollercoast rides, the pirate boat, the adventure playground, laser quest, the balloon wheel before taking in lunch. All three were loving it. Jessica fortunately was 0.5 centimetre tall enough to go on most rides. </p><p>Ben and Jessica went on the junior version of the driving school. They were both surprisingly better than expected. Jessica managed to actually keep her foot on the pedal and kind of steered ok, although she was looking around alot at others. Ben's rides was quite low key. Anyway they both really enjoyed it. Katie went on the 7-14 year old version. She did not enjoy it, because she could not see Daddy all of the time. This is becoming quite a handicap for her and limits her ability to join in many activities.</p><p>We played around in the water splash area, went around the mini lego countries before going on the tyre ride. Our last go was on the racing game where we had to design our drivers and car before sitting in a race car and playing a computer game race. We ended at 8pm when the park shut. We were treated to fish and chips on the way home.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_08_05-04-Legoland.jpg</src><caption>Dragon Castle</caption></image>

    <title>Doniford Bay Holiday - Visiting The Scott's</title>
    <info>
		<p>We left on time, managed to fit everything into the car easily and without too much stress which is quite amazing for us lot. We headed south, by the time we hit Hook, we had to stop one of a bazzilion time for a toilet break. Stop, start, stop, start.</p><p>We arrived a little late of Mummy's school friend, Jessica. It was really nice to meet up again, first time in 2.5 years. They had a little girl called Sine, pronounced Sheena, who was born two days before Jessica. She was such a well behaved sweet girl. We had our little Jessica, who bounded in with her big pink sunglasses, on upside down and her handbag and purse. She looked a right proper diva. She looked trouble all over.</p><p>Tobias was woken up, He was a sweetie at 10 months old. We played in the backgarden and turned the toy box upside down. We all played very nicely together. Sheena and Jessica took a while to warm to each other but played nicely towards the end. We had scrummy pizza. We spent over 2 hours there before moving on.</p><p>Quatre of an hour into the journey down to Doniford, Daddy had forgotton his wallet! Daddy told Mummy to ring Jessica to let her know. Mummy then goes, 'Oopie' as she had also forgotten her handbag which had the mobiles in it. We then proceeded to get hopelessly lost on our return. All a bit of a nightmare, but we eventually completed the 90 minute second leg of our journey.</p><p>We settled into our challet (sha-laaay) which was the nicest out of all our previous accomodations. We were quite impressed. We quickly caught the last part of a swimming session.</p><p>After unpacking, Daddy went to drive to the supermarket. Disaster, the car wouldn't start. Wouldn't even turn over. Electrics all OK. Had an argument because Mummy said she had renewed our breakdown cover, but hadn't and would cost an extra £90 to join up! Daddy, being tight refused to pay this. Thankfully after a couple of hours the car worked again. Must be a problem when the car gets hot.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_08_06-01-Day1-TheScotts.jpg</src><caption>Jessica in her pink glasses stroking Tobias</caption></image>

    <title>Doniford Bay Holiday - Burnham On Sea</title>
    <info>
		<p>We awoke at normal time, 6:30am and headed for the football courts and playgrounds and mucked about there for a bit. We then went for our first breakfast which consisted of a fry-up. Daddy was worried we would all turn fat! We went to the pirate soft play whilst Daddy went to get the swimming stuff. The weather was awful as it rained on and off. We didn't mind as we were wet anyway. Beside the outdoor pool was a four lane race slide which we had great fun going down. Katie won most of the races. We played piggy in the middle in the indoor pool.</p><p>We then decided to head towards Weston Super Mare. We stopped off for some food at Burnham On Sea only to find our car wouldn't start again! Oh dear. We decided to ditch the car and take the long walk into Burnham and have lunch on the beach. It was really windy and the seagulls circled us looking for some scraps. Whilst we were playing on the sandy and muddy beach, the naughty seagulls swooped down and stole our bread. Ben valiantly tried to shoo them away. We played hop scotch, find what mummy says to get, races and dug big holes. Daddy and Jesscia went to get the car which fortunately started again.</p><p>We returned back home, fitted in a quick swim again before getting ready for the camp's evening entertainment. We were all a bit shy in getting up and joining in the dancing.</p><p>We had bangers and mash for dinner, watched our favourite TV programme, 101 Ways To Leave A Game Show before going to bed.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_08_07-05-Day2-BurnhamOnSea.jpg</src><caption>Just us on a sandy, sunny beach</caption></image>

		<p>After another fried breakfast we headed to the arcades where we were introduced to the penny shove game. Of course we lost.</p><p>Today we decided to use our National Trust cards and headed just up the road to Dunster Castle. We climbed the hill and first off was some shows about the English Civil war. We first looked at how the soldiers dresses and their weaponary. Ben was quite into this and when they asked for a volunteer to see how heavy the helmet was, Ben stood up like a shot.</p><p>We went around the castle trying to answer the family quiz as we went. Ben was getting a little bored. There was a garden right up high, with some views to the sea and Exmoor, and down to the battle re-enactment which were good fun to see.</p><p>We had our picnic in the grounds, then returned to our broken car again! Stress-aloni. Whilst we were waiting for Daddy to sort things out we wondered around Dunster village, which was picture perfect and just right for tourists. We went in the dolls museum and went around the shops and bought some postcards to return home.</p><p>Daddy got the car going and we returned mid-afternoon to go swimming for two hours! After dinner we went for the Haven Entertainments! Bingo, which we lost then the Chinese National Circus which Katie particularly enjoyed. There were alot of supple chinese ladies. A late night to bed.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_08_08-11-Day3-Dunster.jpg</src><caption>Dunster Castle</caption></image>

    <title>Doniford Bay Holiday - On Camp</title>
    <info>
		<p>The car was now completely broken and despite Daddy's efforts he couldn't get it going. So we made our own plan of events which included swimming, softplay, arcades, a Dick Whittington pantomime, bingo in the evening followed by a childrens competition which all three of us joined in. Ben is not shy in coming forward, Katie clung onto Mummy and Jessica dancing around beautiful.</p>

    <title>Doniford Bay Holiday - Watchet</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was raining quite a bit today. Without the car we first went for a swim of course then caught the bus into the local village, Watchett. We wandered around the harbour before surprisingly going into a little cafe for lunch.</p><p>We returned back to camp and went to watch the wrestling which we enjoyed immensely. Ben returned wanting to be a wrestler! Surprise, surprise.</p><p>We finally headed on to the beach adjoining the holiday park. It wasn't really a beach that anyone sunbathed or swum from. It was rocky and the water was quite muddy. Not really very inviting. Daddy tried to build a dam on one of the streams reaching into the sea. It started to rain. Daddy and Katie went for a long walk in the sea upto Doniford. It wasn't the nicest of beaches to walk across. Alot of building rubble there. However, the waves were crashing in. Daddy really enjoyed his walk with his eldest.</p><p>We got back and went Aqua Gliding which was like a junior, inflatable jet ski. This was held in the swimming pool and involved the instructor giving the children some tasks whilst also trying to put them off. Katie and Ben absolutely loved it. Continually laughing and smiling.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_08_10-17-Day5-Watchet.jpg</src><caption>Ben Aqua Gliding</caption></image><p>We played Bingo again and lost. Mummy kept Katie up extra late to enjoy the special Hanah Montana, High School Musical and Grease show which she loved. The dirty sto outs did not return till 11:15pm!</p>

    <title>Doniford Bay Holiday - Minehead</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy was organising for the car to get towed away to a local garage this morning, whist the rest of us went swimming and soft playing.</p><p>Early afternoon we decided to get the bus again into Minehead. We coincidently picked a day when the Red Arrows were doing their display. We walked down the nice, but busy high street, spending Uncle Steven's birthday money on a body board. We made the promenade where there seemed to be thousands of people lining the beach wall waiting for the aerobatics display. Katie, Ben and Jessica didn't seemed all that bothered by the Red Arrows whilst Mummy and Daddy watched the 20 minute show. After, we headed onto the beach and played around before heading to the supermarket for more food and a long bus journey home. Mummy read Charlie And The Glass Elevator to everyone on the bus it seemed.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_08_11-02-Day6-Minehead.jpg</src><caption>Minehead Beach</caption></image>

    <info>
		<p>After a swim and some crazy golf we hired out some pedal go-karts which was great fun. We all had a go and taking passengers around the park. Daddy went to go and pick up the car which cost a whopping £350! A new starter motor needed.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_08_12-09-Day7-Porlock.jpg</src><caption>Would you trust him cycling around?</caption></image><p>A sense of freedom we decided to venture out into Exmoor, although everyone seemed more interested in listening to Mummy's Charlie and the Glass Elevator. We stopped off for a picnic before moving onto a dissapointing and wet Porlock. We parked up expecting a beach or something. Nothing. It was Porlock Weir we wanted. So we shifted down the road.</p><p>We loved Porlock Weir. We played around the pill box and walked around the harbour before getting some yummy ice creams.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_08_12-44-Day7-Porlock.jpg</src><caption>Ice Cream at Porlock Weir</caption></image>

    <title>Ben - Thomas Burrows Over To Stay, Katie at overnight at Elders</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ben returned the invite to Thomas to come and stay the night which he was very excited about. Bless him, he's desperate to have one of his friends over. Well they got on like a house on fire. No conflicts, just mainly wrestling each other and showing off. It's so nice to see that Ben and Thomas get on really well, especially as we don't see Thomas all that often.</p><p>Games mainly involved sword fighting and playing with cars, and being naughty at bed time when they would not go to sleep! For a bit anyway. Mummy and Daddy were struck how well mannered Thomas was ,saying please and thank you and putting stuff in the bin. The 'See you in the morning' comment was very cute. Just need some of those manners to be transfered across onto us lot!</p><p>Meanwhile, Katie went over to the Elders to stay for the night to make way for Thomas. Thankfully she handled being away from mummy ok. She loved her stay.</p><p>Feel sorry for Ben a bit, despite our efforts, Ben has not seen much of his two closest mates from school, Oliver and Joey, over the holidays. Mummy has invited them both over, however they have not been any return invites and they didn't turn up for his party which Ben was a little upset about. They are also both in a different class to Ben next year. As socialable and likeable Ben is, he does not have many friends and he's not the loner type. We hope he'll make some really good new friends in the next school year.</p>

    <info>
		<p>We went over to Ma Ma and Pop Pop's on Friday and stayed the night. All was pretty calm during the nigt except that Katie would not goto sleep. We headed early into Gravesend to look for school accessories. It's been a while since we been there. We stopped off for a drink and a cake at a cafe.</p><p>We then moved on to Chatham and to the dissapointing discount village where the got two pairs of school shoes for nearly £40! </p><p>We parted ways from Ma Ma and Pop Pop and moved on to see Helen and Nigel's new house which was only around the corner from their previous home. It was huge and of course Nigel's pride and joy was his double garage. Us children enjoyed playing on the Wii. Ben took over on the sword fighting game.</p><p>We raced home, picked up Farmor to babysit us, whilst Mummy and Daddy headed down to Littlehampton as the Glidewell's hosted the next round. They did extremely well with their Thai themed meal. We were trying all our tricks with the Fars in order to stay up late. A drink of apple juice, a drink of milk, need the toilet, read a book, read another chapter, etc. They fell for some of them.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_08_21-18-GlidewellComeDineWithMe.jpg</src><caption>Diners</caption></image>

    <title>Farfar's 64th Birthday - Family Picnic</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went around to the Far's house for a long breakfast and present opening. Mummy and Ben went off to church. We loved climbing the tree out the front of the house. Katie got stuck up there twice! Jessica called them monkeys.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_08_22-01-FarfarBirthday.jpg</src><caption>A birthday treat for Farfar</caption></image><p>In the afternoon we went to the Barnett family picnic which was held at Staines Llamas park where the sprayground was. We loved it in there. Frazer pushed Daddy through the rainbow bit twice which meant he got soaked! It was nice to see Peter and Norma there. We played a big game of cricket. Daddy was out with two golden ducks. We played with Felicity and Frazer and of course Joey and Lily.</p><p>After our picnic we had a go on the train and had some lovely lollies before dipping back into the sprayground!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_08_22-04-FamilyPicnic.jpg</src><caption>Frazer and Jessica</caption></image>

    <title>Meet up with the Teale's</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Daddy set us all a challenge. Daddy was to jog about 1.5 miles. Katie and Ben were to keep track and set the pace on their bikes. Mummy had to get to Colony Gate before Daddy went to the Red Road roundabout and back again.</p><p>Katie faultered immediately and decided not to go by bike, instead choosing her scooter. Ben did very well on his bike keeping up with Daddy barking encouragment whilst jogging. Ben found it a little hard to go up the slight inclines, but he never gave up. The boys beat the slow girls to Colony Gate. Muumy citing Jessica's non biking and walking policy as the main reason for their failings!</p><p>All five of us then went to Tomlinscote and Skate Jam. There were not many there to begin with and only Mummy and Katie wanted to participate. However, bith Ben and Jessica were running round with the skaters. Ben was also getting into photography again and taking pictures of everyone!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_08_28-09a-SkateJam.jpg</src><caption>Skate Jam</caption></image><p>After lunch we split. Daddy went off to watch Chertsey play Chatham in the FA Cup, whilst the rest of us went to Reigate Park and met up with the Teale's.</p>

    <title>10 Year Wedding Anniversary - Back To School</title>

		<p>What a ten years - 3 children, 2 houses and 1 wedding. Not a big thing made of it other than a card each.</p><p>It was also Katie's first day at Frimley C of E - Year 3. Hard to get any information about how the day has gone. She is in Mrs Cope's class. She sit's next to Leah Sumner. She got a homework diary and has now started French, Science and Personal, Social, Health Education lessons.</p><p>Ben is in Year 1 and in Mrs Sollars' class. Something a bit dodgey goes on for registration. There are 11 year 1 pupils which go down into reception for registration, to make it look as though there are additional children in the lower year. He's on Panda table, with 33 in his class.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_09_02-08-FirstDaySchool.jpg</src><caption>First Day Back At School</caption></image>

    <title>Ma Ma and Uncle Peter Babysit - Mummy and Daddy off to Bath</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy and Daddy treated themselves to celebrate their tin wedding anniversary by going to Bath for the day and an overnight stay in a hotel. Ma Ma therefore dared to come over the night before and look after us for the day. We were excited at the prospect of this and weren't bothered at all that Mummy and Daddy were off although we kept in regular contact with them through out the day.</p><p>After waving Mummy and Daddy off, we went over to pick Uncle Peter up as he was to look after us as well. We first went to Farnborough to do some Tenpin bowling, then went into the softplay in the leisure centre. One we hadn't been to before. Later in the afternoon we dropped Katie off at Alistair Rushforth's, whilst the four of us went around to Farmor's house for a chat and a play.</p><p>In the evening we read stories until quite late.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mummy and Daddy eventually got into Bath and first walked through the city centre streets and went in to the Jane Austin museum which Mummy enjoyed. She bought the book Persuasion. After a posh baguette, they strolled around and ended at the Spa. There was a roof top spa which was heated lovely, and had views onto the hills around Bath. There was also lots of steam rooms and a big spa pool on the bottom floor. Mummy and Daddy enjoyed their two hours in there. The famous tea rooms, Sally Lunns was next where they both went for one the big buns. Walking by the river, there was a game of lacross by the rugby ground, so decided to stop by and watch. It was a pretty agressive. A pub was found for dinner. Daddy had some lovely lamb. Mmmm. They stayed in the Travelodge hotel on the M4. How romantic.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_09_04-11-Bath.jpg</src><caption>Bath</caption></image>

    <title>Jessica's 3rd Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>Jessica didn't really comprehaned that she was 3 today, but she did know she would be eventually getting a 'tooter' (scooter). We awoke standard time, Jessica a little weary opening here presents in Mummy and Daddy's bedroom. Along with the 'tooter' she got a Peppa Pig umbrella and some Peppa Pig figures that she likes playing with her dolls house.</p><p>After a couple of 'happy birthday' phone calls, and a nice visit from the Sanders, Mummy and Ben went off to Waitrose with a tin collecting for Grandad's Wing charity. The rest of us went around to the Far's house to destroy it for a bit! Climbing the tree in the front garden is the main attraction at the moment.</p><p>After a spot of lunch we all prepared for the party which was to be held on the patch of park opposite our house. An ingenious plan as it gave us room to spread out. We pitched the gazebo up, got table and chairs and a load of outdoor toys. The weather thanfully had improved quite considerably. Daddy was on BBQ duty and we had about 20 guests.</p><p>Jessica had Joey, Lily, Summer, Alice, Thomas and Natasha to play with. We did 'parcel parcel', but mainly we played on the playground and Uncle Michael's make up parlour! We sang happy birthday and cut the cake. The older ones later played football. Thomas displaying his no mercy, savage tackling tactics! Ben was bouncing around the goal, he was pretty excited whenever the ball came close to him. Never quite sure if it was excitement or he just needed the toilet!</p><woops woopstitle="Both great grandparents kiss two random children instead of their great grandchildren!" rating="6"><p>Continuing playing football, a boy of about 10 and girl of 8 asked if they could join in. we of course said yes. This was getting to the end of the party and Great Grandma and Grandad were heading off home. They came around to say goodbye to everyone. They got a little confused, grandad gave a hug to the girl, which we thought was a bit friendly, then gave her a kiss goodbye and talked to her probably thinking she was Katie. Daddy and Uncle Michael were a little stunned. Grandma then doddered over and done exactly the same thing. The poor girl didn't know what had hit her. Surrounded by a load of strangers and two old people who they didn't know coming to give her a kiss goodbye. The girl sloped away 5 minutes later!</p></woops><p>A good time had by all. Thanks so much for the lovely presents, and for all those making the effort to come.

    <title>Fars Ruby Wedding Aniversary</title>
    <info>
		<p>40 years ago, the Fars were married with a congregation of 13 people. Today there were 13 of us who set sail from Shepperton up the Thames on a nice little boat. The weather thankfully was good which made all the difference and allowed us to stay outside and marvel at the rich boy houses which lined the river. Farfar was first to drive us as we went through a number of locks and navigated around a few nutter sail boats.</p><p>We stopped off at The Wier pub for a nice spot of lunch and worrying about being moored up next to the 'Valhalla' barge. The ladies looked mean, the barge was mat black all over. Farfar did his best to sink us when mooring up in Molesey lock. It was rather a heavy brush with the side. Pop Pop on the other hand grounded us when looking for a half time rest. Thankfully after 5 minutes of reverse and moving about the boat we were freed!</p><p>On the journey with us were Auntie Susan and Graham, Graham's parents and Ma Ma and Pop Pop. We could climb around on the roof and we all even had a go at steering the boat, although we needed to stand on a chair to see where we were going. We made it as far as Hampton turned around and stopped off by the church for some cake and coffee. Farfar made a little speach and opened the present that we got him, a box!</p><p>We were dropped off back at Shepperton, leaving the Fars to sail off into the sunset to return the boat back to the marina. A thoroughly nice time had by all.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_09_12-02-ChrisJetteRubyThames.jpg</src><caption>Chris and Jette's Wedding 1</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_09_12-10-ChrisJetteRubyThames.jpg</src><caption>Chris and Jette's Wedding 2</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_09_12-90-ChrisJetteRubyThames.jpg</src><caption>Chris and Jette's Wedding 3</caption></image>

She has had a few taster sessions with Mummy and all have gone well. Today she was going to be left! We had a little trouble with Ben and especially Katie at this bit, however, Jessica took it all in her stride and was ready to immerse herself in all the toys.</p><p>Reports back from the teacher was that she had a good time and behaved herself very well. Mummy for the first time in 7 years has now got a couple of hours free, three times a week to herself!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_09_14-02-JessicaFirstDayAtPlayschool.jpg</src><caption>Ready and waiting for playschool</caption></image>

    <title>Skate Jam, Sofia's 4th birthday, Leah Sumner over to stay</title>
    <info>
		<p>Leah sumner came over in the morning and we split straight away. Mummy took Ben and Jessica to Sofia's 4 th birthday party held at Jake's softplay, whilst Daddy took Katie and Leah to Tomlinscote for SkateJam. It was packed there, must have been 50 children skating around in circles. Katie getting more and more confident. She is able to go around now quite steadily. Daddy helped Leah around and tried to teach her how to skate. In the end Leah was able to go across the hall by her self, without falling over or holding onto anything.</p><p>The weather was good in the afternoon so went around Dettingen estate and played on the swings. Katie and Leah played an extensive game of teachers. Jessica and Ben made dens, plaster of paris figures and generally a lot of mess!</p><p>After watching Matilda (Daddy having just read the book to us) we went to bed in our den!</p>

    <title>Westminster and South Bank</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy did another very early shift at work - 6am start! He's trying to save up for a kayak. Meanwhile we went to church.</p><p>In the afternoon we battled through the traffic and parked right outside Millbank Tower. We had a scooter, pushchair and bikes and rode along the Thames to the Houses Of Parliament, stopping off of course at some swings which we found on the way.</p><p>We were nervous seeing Ben winding uncomfortably on his bike through the crowds by Westminster bridge where we crossed. A very kind Japanese tourist took a couple of phots of us. He was very helpful.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_09_19-14-WestminsterSouthBank.jpg</src><caption>Houses of Gay</caption></image><p>We headed to South Bank, stopped for a cuppa and a go on the playground, before watching some of the entertainment. I think we were mesmerized by the cat in the hutch. Hard to describe really. We also saw a man with very long arms, a man with 3 legs, some limbo dancers, Elvis and some silver statues.</p><p>We then returned back to the car this time going along the south path of the Thames and crossing Lambeth bridge. Jessica was showing off her 'tooter' skills, by racing along and then lifting one leg in the air. She's copied this off her older siblings. She's so cute!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_09_19-22-WestminsterSouthBank.jpg</src><caption>Jessica's got the skills</caption></image>

    <title>Horley Scarecrow Fete - Reigate Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy had found a scarecrow festival in Horley which was about an hour away in the car. We arrived walked through the town of Horley. There were a few stalls and a few scarecrows and a mad women on the PA system. Overall we were not that impressed, so after an hour we moved on.</p><p>We found a nice spot in White Bushes where there was a swing park and a chance for us to eat our picnic. Autumn was arriving, and although sunny it was a little on the chilly side. Us three children played nicely together.</p><p>We again moved on a little further this time stopping at the favoured spot of Reigate Park. A new one for daddy. And he had to admit it was a good playground. We were on the tyre swings for ages before going on the zip slide and climbing the crows nest on the boat. We left and headed for the 'ramps'. All three of us had scooters with us. After many aborted attempts, Ben braved going on the busy ramps on his scotter. Mummy couldn't bare to look, worrying that he was going to get knocked by one of the other children. He absolutely loved it. He described something like, 'my heart was beating so fast it felt like it had stopped.'.... that sounds like he had an adrenaline rush!</p><p>On the way home we again stopped off at Reigate Hill for a sleep on the hill for Mummy and Daddy and an opportunity to do backwards rollie pollies.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_09_25-30-Reigate.jpg</src><caption>Backwards Rollie Pollies</caption></image>

Us children did really well especially up that big hill at the end.</p><p>Katie rollerscated which was interesting in the woods, Ben went on his bike, which was interesting next to the main road - we had to tell him to get off as he was making the rest of us nervous with his constant uncontrolled weaving from side to side, and Jessica had her scotter, which she used for about 30 seconds!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_10_03-01-WoodsWalk.jpg</src><caption>Ben biking through the woods</caption></image>

    <title>Shalford - Send: River Wey</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Daddy took Jessica on the bike of his bike and decided to go on a new river route in our quest to do as many river side rides as possible.</p><p>We started at Shalford and headed north up the River Wey, through Guildford up to Send. It was really tough and Daddy over-estimated what could be achieved. By half way he was beginning to feel dizzy and very hungry. Jessica was excellent company and was chatting, tickling and singing for most of the way. We stopped off a number of time to share the water. We spotted lots of wildlife from ducks in the water to cows lying right by a fence in a farmers field. Next stage is Send to Byfleet.</p><p>The rest of us had two church services; the normal and later a children's service. We walked home.</p><p>In the afternoon we had a nice time going for a walk around the estate and played by the garage.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_10_01-BenStory-BeastQuestSnakeDog.jpg</src><caption>A Beast Quest Story by Ben Gay</caption></image>

		<p>The weather is turning and getting cold. In the morning Daddy and Jessica went into Farnborough and got some bread and a packet of eye patches from the fancy dress shop. The eye patches are for Daddy who is going to try and strengthen the muscles in his lazy left eye.</p><p>In the afternoon we went to St Georges excellent playground and then onto swimming. We of course had a great laugh with the mats playing crocdiles and generally mucking around. Jessica was performing some expert slow rolly polies from the edge of the pool into the water. It was the funniest thing ever. Daddy knew he should stop her from doing it, but it was so funny he had to leave it to the lifegaurd to tell her to stop it!</p><p>The evening again was taken up by Strictly Come Dancing, Katie stylishly and elegantly gracing the dance floor, Ben and Jessica end up going round in circles as quickly as possible and then wrestling on the floor!</p>

After we looked around Tomlinscote School. It's got so much bigger. Katie then decided we should pop into the Fars, where Lise, Jørgen and Julie were staying for the week. We had some food and a nice chat before returning home for lunch.</p><p>In the early afternoon we went into Farnborough for provisions and a spot of swimming. Again it was such a laugh. Everyone loves a splash about.</p><p>Later in the afternoon, the Danish came around to visit. Katie got on particularly well with Julie, although it was difficult to communicate with one another. It was good to see nothing has changed, Jørgen still enjoying his beer and fags, whilst Lise was very into everything.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_10_30-10-LiseJorgen</src><caption>Lise, Julie and the crew</caption></image>

    <title>Halloween Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the afternoon we had a Halloween party and the participants for this slightly frenetic, mad affair were the Fars, Ma Ma and Pop Pop, the Elders, Lise, Jørgen and Julie.</p><p>First was Halloween bingo, followed by apple bobbing, then dangling doughnuts and pin the wart on the witch! The funniest things were seeing the adults attempting to eat the doughnuts and watching Farfar lumber to the apple bobbing like an elephant to a trough of water!</p><p>The fars dropped off home whilst the rest of us conveyed around the area trick or treating. First stop was an unwell Uncle Peter, then Great Grandma's where we had some excellent ginger cake. We stopped off quickly at Paula's before surprising Auntie Sue and Richard. It was scary around the Fars, but Uncle Howard felt the full force of the team when he refused to open the door. we thought it highly ammusing stuffing our sweet wrappers through his letterbox. He had some feeble excuse of not being in because he thought Halloween was yesterday!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_10_31-11-Haloween.jpg</src><caption>Doughnuts!</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_10_31-18-Haloween.jpg</src><caption>Mummy</caption></image>

		<p>This weekend was 'boyley' orientated, focused around boys stuff. In the morning Daddy took Ben to football training which was back at Frimley. Jessica came along to watch as well. They did football skills for the first 40 minutes. At one point Ben came last in a task which meant a forefeit which he didn't want to do. It was a little humiliating for him to run 20 metres like a chicken. Straight after he cried and wanted to go home. That tactic of the coaching staff was unsuccessful with the three children they tried it on. Ben finished with a flurish in the game and looks forward to next week, of course wearing his Denmark kit.</p><p>In the afternoon the same team went out to watch the Tempest Rally picking up Daddy's friend Michael on the way. Dolly Daddy got the timings a little bit out so only saw a couple of cars in the Warren stage! We then all went over to the Yateley stage and waited patiently for the 4 wheel drive cars and the impressive 2 wheel cars. Daddy loved seeing his old Escort go through. Ben and Jessica had fun scrambling around in the woods. Ben must have gone for a wee about 10 times!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_11_06-25-TempestRally.jpg</src><caption>King of the road - Ford Escort</caption></image><p>In the evening we went to Ravenscote School for their firework display. We met up with Susan, Graham and the Fars. I think for the first time, none of us felt scared and so we were all able to enjoy the 20 minute display. All very pretty. It was extremely busy.</p>

    <title>Firecracker XIX</title>
    <info>
		<p>We headed early to Kent. Mummy took Ben to Southfleet church where she met up with Ma Ma and Pop Pop. Meanwhile the others went to buy treats for the afternoon.</p><p>The girls plus Pop Pop had a Sunday roast before having a nice afternoon in playing.</p><p>Meanwhile Daddy and Ben went off to Thurrock to watch Firecracker XIX, a big Banger event. We met up with the late coming Fars. It was Ben's first real time at a Banger meeting. Daddy thought he'd love it. There must have been 4 or 5 thousand people there. On the card were 10 races, including unlimited Bangers, a few Robin Reliant races and of course the Destruction Derby. We were not disapointed by the action. Ben's favourites were:</p><ul><li><i>Bangers</i>Because the cars were so big Ben loved it when the track was blocked so the cars had to bash a route through!
        </li><li><i>Robins</i>When they turned over the stewards ran over and pushed them the right way up again!
        </li><li><i>Pits</i>We get close to the bashed up cars!
        </li></ul><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_11_07-12-FirecrackerXIX.jpg</src><caption>Burger King</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_11_07-22-FirecrackerXIX.jpg</src><caption>Ben's dream car</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_11_07-30-FirecrackerXIX.jpg</src><caption>A pair of Robins</caption></image><p>We moved around the track a bit to get some good spots to see, Ben always had the best place on Daddy's shoulders! Farfar queued for 45 minutes to get Ben a burger, and of course he got himself one as well! There were long gaps between the races, luckily Farmor bought some cakes and coffee.</p><p>Overall we saw loads of crashes, next year we'll bring some crates to stand on. We can't wait for next year.</p>

    <title>Football, Kayak Pickup, Teale Sleep Over, Elder Come Dine With Me</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy and Ben went to Football pracetice in the morning. Ben really enjoyed himself and joked with some of the others down there, all of whom he hasn't met previously.</p><p>Whilst Daddy went to Southampton to pickup his new Kayak, Karen, Summer and Alice came around to pickup Katie who went to the Teale household for the night. She watched Strictly Come Dancing, played Sylvainian families, had loads of sweets and goodies and stayed upto midnight watching Grease. Needless to say she enjoyed herself thoroughly.</p><p>The Fars came over to babysit Ben and Jessica, whilst Mummy and Daddy went out to the final leg of Come Dine With Me at the Elders. They really pushed the boat out with a firepit where we roasted chestnuts and marshmellows, there was a racing a chinese lantern and of course a lovely three course meal. All the scores were totted up from all the rounds and we....... came last. The results were the Glidewell's, the Sanders follwed by the Elders and the Gay's bringing up the rear.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_11_13-01-ElderComeDineWithMe.jpg</src><caption>Happy eaters</caption></image>

    <title>Charlotte Evening</title>
    <info>
		<p>We joined up with the Elders to spend the weekend visiting Charlotte and her boyfriend Luke. We met in Stroud for a cup of tea and for some reason Mummy wanted to look at Wilkinson's! We moved onto our nearby hotel in Eastington and began a GeoCache hunt. This took us along a canal and onto a graveyard. It took a while to find the treasure, however, Auntie Ellie eventually found it and we added our names to the list.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_11_20-14-Stonehouse.jpg</src><caption>Katie ghosting in the graveyard!</caption></image><p>It was getting dark so we returned to the hotel, unpacked and got ready to head to Cheltenham. We arrived at Luke's house where Charlotte was part lodger, part worker and part girlfriend! She cooked a large curry which was far too hot for Daddy, but everyone else enjoyed it. Luke was really nice and easy to talk to and the two of them made a good couple.</p><p>Us children had a great time playing around with each other, sliding around on the floors, watching Strictly and just having fun. Jessica and Lily went to bed, whilst we finished ice cream desert.</p><p>A really nice evening. Thanks to Charlotte.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Daddy and Auntie Ellie rose early for a morning run. However, not knowing the area they made the route up as they went along. 10km later they eventually turned up back at the hotel via some nice countryside and almost got mown down by an HGV truck as they run on the main trunk road to the motorway!</p><p>We were hungry for breakfast, so made our way to McDonalds in Stroud, via Sainsbury's and a stroll around Stroud. The kids were euphoric, whilst Daddy was a little less enthusiastic. After filling our mouths with Grease, we headed to the Cotswolds Country Park.</p><p>It was bitterly cold so we weren't long at the playground, before heading off back home.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_11_21-10a-CotswoldWaterPark.jpg</src><caption>The Weekend Crew</caption></image>

    <title>Danish Christmas Bazaar</title>

		<p>After church, we headed up to London for the celebration of advent at the Christmas Bazaar inside the Danish YMCA. It was really busy and crowded, but managed to navigate our way around the Christmas and food stalls. We met with the Fars and sat in the cafe eating some æbleskive (pancake ball things), smørbrød (open sandwich) with a tipple of glogg (mulled wine). Mmm.</p><p>We bought some small bits and pieces, Mummy almost fainted when she had to pay £3 for a packet of crisps. After a few circulations, we headed outside for a hot pølser (sausage), before returning home via the London Christmas lights.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_11_28-01-DanishBazaar.jpg</src><caption>Eating Danish Food</caption></image>

    <title>Ben's Nativity, Daddy back to school</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy had the day off today. It was really cold at -2 and there was snow and ice all over the place. Daddy's motorbike wouldn't start. He and Jessica went to playschool. Jessica was vey excited and wanted Daddy to do everything with her. They drew, glued stuff together at craft, played at the workbench, shared fruit at snack time, and read stories. In fact Daddy read 'Clicl Clack Crocodile's Back' to the whole playschool at storytime. It was really nice for Jessica to see Daddy there.</p><p>In the afternoon, the Fars looked after Jessica whilst Mummy and Daddy arrived 45 minutes early for Ben's Nativity play. The early arrival was because Mummy wanted the best seats. Ben played a shepherd and sang a couple of songs. A sweet production. Mummy said he was the cutest, Daddy said he looked like a serving maid!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_01-05-BenNativityPlay.jpg</src><caption>Ben the shepherd</caption></image><p>After picking the children up from school and delivering Evie Sanders' advent candle we went to the Fars for a cup of tea and to pick Jessica up.</p>

    <title>Frimley C of E Christmas Fair</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was bitterly cold again today. In the afternoon we went over to the Frimley C of E Christmas Fair at Katie's school. Of course Mummy had volunteered to run a couple fo stalls. Thankfully we had half an hour where we could go around all the other rooms and get things. We had a budget of £2 each. It was a case of seeing something we liked and spending the money, rather than wait to see everything then decide. Ben spent most of his money on Match Attax, a bit like football stickers. He's been into them all weekend and beyond, so certainly money well spent. We all had a go at decorating a bauball and a few goes on various things.</p><p>Later, the Fars turned up, who we subsequently fleeced and they came around to help us do things. After a couple of hours we tidied up and returned home.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_04-07-FrimleyCofEXmasFete.jpg</src><caption>Bauball Factory</caption></image>

Mummy meanwhile was raising money for the playschool with her sacks of reindeer food and cakes she had made for the Christmas Fair.</p><p>Jessica was an angel in her nativity play and had Katie's angel costume, which was about 10cm too big for her! It was a packed performance with over 50 parents and grandparents there. Jessica was either overwhelmed or in her own little world during the performance, uttering a few lines here and there to the songs. Still it was lovely to see, and she looked proud that mummy and daddy were there to watch her.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_10-01-JessicaNativityPlay.jpg</src><caption>What an angle</caption></image>

		<p>Evie came over with the Sanders crew for a child swap day! We get Evie, whilst the Sanders get us delightful 3!</p><p>Mummy and Daddy bathed in the calmness over lunch, then took Evie to Santa Firs where she met some reindeer and a giant inflatable Father Christmas. Evie took Mummy on the horse and cart ride, then took Daddy on the tractor ride. We had a look around all the Christmassy things in the shop. Not too sure what she was thinking when Mummy put on the novelty hats on her! The rendez vous point was McDonalds at Farnborough Gate, and yes they had an unhealthy meal! </p><p>We rushed home as Katie was performing in Deepcut barracks to some important soldiers. After they sang carols a magic man came onto stage and Katie was picked out to assist him in one of his tricks. She was most pleased about that. Katie also has been taking a shine to one of the boys in here year, Lucas. As parents we are not taking the micky out of her or embarrassing her just playing along.</p><p>Mummy coincidently also went to watch a band perform at the same barracks.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_11-01-EvieSanders-SantaFirs.jpg</src><caption>Reindeer food to your left.</caption></image>

Katie, Ben, Jess and Harrison all seemed really happy with their hauls. Freya's, Make your own apron didn't go down a hit. Nice one Daddy. We could tear Harrison away from the Thomas The Tank Engine set that we had and kicked a fuss up when he had to leave. There was a fleeting visit from Ma Ma, Pop Pop and Uncle Peter. Ben was most pleased to beat Uncle Peter at a game of Stratego... and didn't we hear about it!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_12-03-Wests.jpg</src><caption>Harrison enjoying his present opening</caption></image>

    <title>Sent off and broken toe for Daddy's troubles</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy played in his 5 a-side team, Casuals tonight. The referee wasn't playing at his peak performance and Daddy helpfully pointed a few areas where he could improve. The referee took exception to this and sent Daddy off. Daddy not 100% agreeing with the decision, took out his frustration on the wooden boarding. That ended in a broken toe, un be known to Daddy though! We drew the game 3-3. Daddy had it diagnosed two days later, when the pain was getting too much so visited casulty in the early hours of Wednesday morning.</p>

		<p>We were split up this morning. The night before Mummy took us down to Ma Ma and Pop Pop's while she went out on the annual Teale-Weston Christmas meal. Both Ben and Katie were not feeling too well, and in the middle of the night Mummy went out to find a 24 hour pharmacy. Meanwhile Ma Ma thought it was morning time and got Jessica up. When Mummy returned at 4am she wondered why Ma Ma and Jessica were playing Barbie's!</p><p>Meanwhile Daddy was using his feet as ski's as he motorcycled home in the snow! Not bad seeing he hadn't his motorbike boots and a broken toe! Daddy then went out with his old work colleagues in Guildford which was really nice!</p><p>We took 3 hours to battle our way home. Unfortunately we had to cancel the Christmas Party. First time for quite a few years! Instead we had an at home day and played loads of board games.</p>

    <title>Thomas Burrows 5th Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>There was double church again this morning. In the afternoon Daddy took Ben and Jessica to Thomas' birthday party. However, the poor weather lead to the motorway being closed. Still spirits were high and we arrived half way through, just in time for the food and then the magic act. It was nice to see Thomas and Natasha.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_20-01-ThomasBurrowsBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Magic Man</caption></image>

    <title>Santa at Selfridges</title>
    <info>
		<p>After school we raced up to Kew and caught the tube to Piccadilly Circus where we saw the Christmas lights up Regents street. We got to go around in the train at Selfridges. Katie was being purposely moody. 'The train just goes around in circles!'. We still all enjoyed it.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_18-03-Selfridges.jpg</src><caption>Tubed</caption></image>

    <title>Christmas Eve at the Fars</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy worked until 1:30. We played games then went over to the Fars for a Danish Christmas Evening. First up a game of Coppit, which Uncle Graham won despite Mummy and Ben ganging up on everyone else. Meanwhile Katie was checking the internet to see which country Father Christmas was currently in. Pakistan apparently. Jessica on the otherhand was helping Farmor on the last few touches to the dinner. Roast Pork, caramelized and boiled potato, red cabbage, sausage (for the non-porkers), carrots. Yum. Pudding was a butterscotch tarte and of course our favourite, Ris Alamonde. Farfar won the prize for getting the nut (equivilent to a sixpence). By this stage we had all got up from the table as we are not great eaters outside pasta, rice and chicken nuggets!</p><p>We all mucked in clearing up and then it was time for the main event. Katie and Ben had already sorted the presents into piles of who they were for. Jessica was really into this year and appreciated what presents were. Anyway Daddy took the helm and distributed the presents so one or two people were opening them at a time. These were all presents to or from Susan, Graham, Farmor and Farfar. All got a tidy haul.</p><p>After present opening we had a game of bingo some more coffee and chocolates. It was coming up 8:30 and time to leave.</p><p>We returned home and put out some milk and food for Father Christmas and his reindeer. All three children were asleep by 9pm. Mummy went to midnight mass and returned at 12:40am!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_24-13-ChristmasEve.jpg</src><caption>Christmas Eve Lineup</caption></image>

    <title>Christmas Day</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie woke during the night, 2am, and made it known that Father Christmas had come as there were a load of presents at the end of the bed. However, it wasn't until 6:20am before the Katie, Ben siren piped up and all had to awake. We decamped into Katie and Ben's room and bought in all Jessica's presents as well. How good have they been?</p><p>Did Katie get a Nintendo DS? Yes. Did Ben get his pink scooter? No! Ben's main present was a toy boat and Jessica's a CD player for her bedroom as she is always listening to Katie and Ben's. You could tell they were flagging after about 20 minutes worth of opening.</p><p>Mummy and Daddy opened theirs. Mummy's main presents were a load of Marks and Spencer bras and a pair of boots. Daddy got a coat, mainly because Mummy was getting fed up with his current jacket.</p><p>We all ventured over to the Fars once more, had a lovely breakfast, Mummy went to church. Despite having opened a load of presents over the past 24 hours, we decided to play camps. Auntie Susan came back around and mummy returned from church so part III of opening presents could commence.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_25-107-ChristmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Christmas Day 1</caption></image><p>We said out goodbyes to the Fars and got over to the Weston household for about 1pm, when the children had their Christmas lunch. The Elder children were a lot better at eating Christmas lunch than the Gay's. All ate the turkey though.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_25-25-ChristmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Christmas Day 2</caption></image><p>The girls, plus Daddy walked over to the Fitzgerald household. There was still alot of ice about, so we gingerly made our way over. We saw Helen and Nigel and got a present from them which was very nice. We left in typical style with children screaming. Mummy trod on Katie's feet with her new heavy boots. Because Mummy picked up Katie, Jessica then also started sobbing. If I were the Fitzgeralds, I'd be glad of the piece of quiet when we departed.</p><p>We got home and began opening presents that were to and from the Barnett side of the family. Katie received the Sylvanian Families which she was looking to get, Ben a Star Wars lego spaceship and Jessica a CD player! All done very excitedly. Each of us were proud to also be sorting the presents out before hand.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_25-11-ChristmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Christmas Day 3</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_25-17-ChristmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Christmas Day 4</caption></image><p>After playing with some of the toys, a spot of tea and a bath, it was time for bed.</p><p>The adults then could start their Christmas with a feast of Turkey and all the trimmings, after which they had the carmness in which to open their presents. Yeah right! We finally finished at 10pm just in time for the new Walliams and Lucas comedy about an airport.</p><p>Overall this year was much carmer than previous which was good for all.</p>

    <title>Boxing Day</title>
    <info>
		<p>After a good night's sleep for all for once, we played a little more in the morning before returning home. After running a few errands with Uncle Peter we drove over to the Elders for a Barnett gathering.</p><p>The usual compendium of games, food and catch up ensued. It was good to see great grandma and grandad joining in as well. The bathroom door broke which left Pop Pop having to mobile phone down to Auntie Ellie to let him out!</p><p>The auction this year was probably the highest quality yet. Mummy won some jewelery that had an RRP of $200!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_26-49-BoxingDay.jpg</src><caption>Jessica cuddling Eva</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_26-64-BoxingDay.jpg</src><caption>Find a place to sit and stay there</caption></image>

    <title>Swimming</title>
    <info>
		<p>Probably a record when we went swimming at Farnborough. We had both the baby pool and main pool all to ourselves. It seemed we had our own 3 personal lifeguards! Still we managed to get told off for running along the edge of the pool.</p><p>The Fars came around later to play games. Ben played a best of 3 with his new mini table football game, and won!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_27-04-FarsOverToPlay.jpg</src><caption>Football crazy</caption></image>

    <title>Uncle Pete's Christmas Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>We're still not sorted out places for all our presents just yet. It's quite hard. We are getting through to play or attend to each present.</p><p>Katie went over to Leah's to play in the afternoon and stayed for a sleep over at her Dad's house. Playing on the DS and the Wii were the main sources of attraction.</p><p>The rest of us attended Pete's party which was down in numbers for one reason or another. Anyway we had a good time playing with Pete's interesting toys up in his bedroom. He had loads of funny things, including a fake poo!</p>

    <title>Pantomime - Sleeping Beauty</title>
    <info>
		<p>A whole gaggle of us went to Basingstoke to watch this year's panto, Sleeping Beauty. Jessica stayed back with Uncle Michael and Joey as we thought it was maybe a year too early still.</p><p>The cast had PC Plum from Balamoray, Abi Titmus and Wendy Craig. We had really good seats, right at the front. Pop Pop was very uncomfortable when he got picked out to be the nurse's boyfriend, basically being the butt of a series of 20 jokes through out the act.</p><p>Ben really got into it, epsecially on some of the funny name calling jokes. He was booing and shouting at the actors. A really good time had by all.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_29-01-SleepingBeauty.jpg</src><caption>The cast</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 1: Reminham Walk, News Eve Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>We found a book we were given last Christmas, Walks around London. We found our closest near Henley on Thames so decided to trek up in the car and have ago on the three mile walk. We got there and found that we'd forgotten all the children's coats. Ooops!</p><p>We started with a pushchair and two scooters. Ben's scooter went after 500 yards, and Katie's was carried halfway through. We treked across farmers fields and onto the river. We stopped for a picnic at Hambleden wier then went across the bridge which was good to see the rushing water. We then headed back towards Henley seeing the Island that they start the rowing races from for the regatta before returning back to the car. The children were cold and hungry and surprisingly a bit moany!</p><p>After picking up the scooter we headed to the flower pot which was a country pub where we had a lovely meal in front of a roaring fire.</p><p>Later in the afternoon the Elders came around and the children had a mini New Years Eve party which ended in singing Auld Langsine at about 6pm. A bit wierd.</p><p>After a few attempts at getting the kiddies to bed the adults amongst us started our fun and games. Katie had made the teams up. Daddy, Ellie, Richard, Charlotte and Luke, against Mummy, Michael, Karen, Rachel and Jon.</p><p>We played games right up to midnight, only stopping for food. Daddy had BBQ'ed some pork and gammon.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2010/2010_12_31-00-NewYearsEveParty.jpg</src><caption>Happy New Year</caption></image><p>After we saw midnight, some ofthe boys tried to launch 4 lanterns tied together. It was slightly troublesome and only managed to get one up in the end.</p>

    <title>Elders and Leah Sleepover</title>
    <info>
		<p>The Elders had stayed the night. We went to the skate park over at Mytchett again. This time we rolled Joey and Ben up and down the half pipes. Of course, Ben erached the top making the skateboard stick to the scaffold leaving Ben sliding down on his coat! He loved it. Jessica was also going up the half pipe on her stablizers!</p><p>We popped over to Grandmas and Gradads to see how they are. Grandad was OK, putting on a brave face.</p><p>Leah came over also with her Nintendo DS of course which consumed Katie for 24 hours! They made a camp in the front room, watched Grease and went to sleep very late!</p>

    <title>Charlotte 4th Birthday Party - Fars Sleepover</title>
    <info>
		<p>After church we popped Leah back home. In the afternoon we took down the Christmas decorations.</p><p>Daddy took Jessica to Charlotte's 4th birthday party in Tongham. There was an entertainer who had to work hard to get the 3 and 4 year olds to play the games. Still Jessica and Daddy danced well together and had a really good time.</p><p>In the evening the Fars took us and we stayed over for the night. We stayed up later than we should at the Fars, mainly because our game of our newly discovered board game of Ludo which went on for ever; Katie won. We might have spent the night  in a camp made under the dining table but sleeping downstairs was a little too scary so Jessica slept in the little bedroom by herself with Katie and Ben pushing the Fars out of their bed in the main bedroom.</p><p>With a snugly hot water bottle we read stories from our books then settled down, not to awake until almost nine o’clock next day with Jessie being the first, who then eventually woke the rest of us.</p><p>We watch a Tom &amp; Jerry film with out breakfast but Mum and dad came to collect us before it ended. We all enjoyed ourselves very much and once again, there were no upsets or problems so that we will all be welcomed back again another day for an overnight stay with the Fars.</p>

    <title>Walk 2: Epping Forest Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy and Daddy had a nice morning where they could get up leisurely and calmly, although Daddy still got up before 8am! They came around to pick us up from the Fars and we headed straight off to Epping Forest for the second of our walks out of our book.</p><p>This time we remembered coats and boots. Good job to, as the temperature was freezing. We first walked to the lost pond, which was completely frozen. We attempted to crack it by throwing stones and logs onto the ice. No luck though. We treked across the wood, but soon all three of us were moaning about cold feet. We stopped for a picnic of leftovers, of which only half was edable!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_01_03-20-EppingForest.jpg</src><caption>Katie the Lake maiden</caption></image><p>We carried on the 1.8 mile walk, up and big hill where there was a settlement 2500 years ago! Mummy was the map reader as she thought she could manage this task. However, we ended our walk about a mile away from where we were supposed to be!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_01_03-40-EppingForest.jpg</src><caption>Ben the tree monster</caption></image><p>Daddy, with his broken toe, had to navigate his way back to the car and gather up the stranded walkers who waited behind. Mummy and Daddy enjoyed the walk alot more than us lot.</p>

		<p>Today, Ben was voted on to the school council as the boy representitive from his class. Apparently all the children were able to vote and out of the 4 candidates in Ben's class he got top votes. Politician Ben Gay said he would first try to press through his idea of extra school holidays! We're not entirely sure what the role will entail, still it shows he's a popular lad.</p>

    <title>Walk 3: Turville - Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had quite an active day today. First up, Mummy took Ben off to football. Again it was hard to convince Ben that he was going to enjoy himself, but once he was there and getting stuck in he loved it. It was pretty wet, but Ben enjoyed getting muddied!</p><p>Mummy, Ben and Katie then went to a packed Skate Jam down at Tomlinscote. Ben who really wasn't very confident on skates really excelled and by the end of the session was going around on his own without falling over. He's really improved. Katie on the other hand was being a bit of a madam and was moaning away, not sure if it was through tiredness (because she doesn't go to sleep in bed easily) or whether it was down to being hungry..... which is always the case. Over the last couple of months it feels at time as if Katie has turned into a teenager. Moody and talking about boys, constantly hungry and sometimes not speaking nicely to the grown ups. Other times she is really sweet, a caring sister and fun to be with. I expect we have more of that to come.</p><p>After SkateJam we went home and prepared for our walk. This is the third in our series. We were determined this wouldn't be disasterous like the previous two: the first we forgot coats, the second we got lost..... and this time, we left the picnic in the bag in the front room! A typical Gay day out!</p><p>No matter, we continued and arrived at a sunny Turville, the setting of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. As preparation we watched the 2.5 hour film yesterday and we all loved it. Turville is a little village with a good pub, church, red telephone box, old cottages, and the windmill from the film up on top of the hill. You get the picture a quaint English village.</p><p>We started our 2.5 mile walk up a muddy path and ventured into lots of farmers fields and lots of hills. It had been raining pretty solidly for the past 2 days, so at times we had to drag the pushchair through the mud which was quite interesting. Talking of mud, yes, Ben did managed to find it. All over his clothes and somehow on his face as well. He rivals Daddy at his clumsyness!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_01_08-07-TurvilleWalk.jpg</src><caption>Jessica walking to the gate</caption></image><p>Anyway it was a lovely sunny day and there was absolutely noone about. So we made as much noise as we liked. Katie and Ben played through out the 2.5 hour walk, constantly running off ahead or holding hands. It was so lovely to see.</p><p>The guide book suggested we might see some Red Kites, and suprisingly we saw quite a few. They were so elegant in the air swooping around quite low looking for prey. They had a large wingspan. No matter we pressed on despite Daddy being left behind marvelling at their gracefullness.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_01_08-25-TurvilleWalk.jpg</src><caption>Red Kite</caption></image><p>We arrived back at the village, this time everyone in high spirits. We popped into the pub for some much needed crisps and apple juice! Well worth recommending the walk.</p>

    <title>Walk 5: Central London Walk/Bike Ride</title>
    <info>
		<p>The weather was a bit shakey this morning. Daddy and Jessica went around to see Farfar, Farmor was coffee'ing at church. They did some maintenance work on the bikes before this afternoon's ride. Mummy took the rest of us to church and Sunday school.</p><p>We headed up to London after church and parked just opposite the Ritz. Now not sure if we are mad but all three of us had the bikes and were just about to embark on going on the busiest streets in the country. There was Katie who was OK on the bike, Ben who didn't look where he went, was quite unsteady and kept falling off and didn't have much street awareness, and there was Jessica who fell over a number of times.</p><p>Still we rode past the Ritz and Fortnam and Mason upto Picadilly Circus where we didn't stop long. It was hard hearding everyone together as we all travelled at different paces, especially trying to navigate ourselves around people and not into them! We kind of split into two groups and reassembled at Trafalgar Square. We haven't been here since it had been paedestrianized. We stopped for lunch on one of the benches and marvelled at the fountains.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_01_16-14-LondonWalk.jpg</src><caption>Ben, a little soldier</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_01_16-23-LondonWalk.jpg</src><caption>Horse Gaurds Parade</caption></image><p>Jessica's first big fall flat on her face happened as we were leaving Nelson's Column behind us and headed towards Whitehall. She cried loudly at first , but then setlled down quickly and continued to Horse Gaurds Parade. We stopped to stroke the big horses on the nose and have our picture taken next to the finely dressed guard.</p><p>We went through horse gaurds parade and headed down St. James' park and saw a pelican, a heron and lots of ducks and swans. We stopped at the playground, with the lake and Buckingham Palace as a lovely setting in the background.</p><p>We circled past Buckingham Palace where we lost Jessica for a split second. She bravely rode on ahead. We ran to catch her up and walked back up the Pall. The stopped off to see some more finely dressed guards before climbing the steps by the status of the 'Grand Old Duke Of York', up on to Pall Mall and back to Trafalgar Square.</p>

    <title>Worst Day Ever? Daddy diagnosed with Diabetes, Great Grandad ambulanced to hospital, Katie taken micky of for surname</title>
    <info>
		<p>Hope you are sitting comfortably, this is a tale of woe:</p><p>First off Great Grandad collapsed out of bed and had blocked the doorway to his bedroom making it hard to attend to him. He was eventually taken to accident and emergency and is barely concious. Grandma and their children all went to visit him, but returned soon after as he was not very with it.</p><p>Second, Leah, Katie's best friend is leaving school. Therefore, Katie said her next best friend will be Poppy because they take the micky of her name as well. Katie was told that she would marry Poppy because she was Gay. She then clamed up when asked who and in what context. So this is the first time we know that Katie has had some micky taken from her peers about her surname.</p><p>Thirdly, Daddy has been really thirsty over the past month and over the past two days has gone for tests. The normal glucose level is 4 to 7 mol. Daddy had three readings 23, 20 and 19! So casually booked a doctors appointment for today. Once in the doctors Daddy had a blood and urine tests. The glucose level was at ++++ as were his ketones ++++. Apparently that was enough pluses for me to be refered to Casualty. So went home, told Mummy the news and told work that I was unlikely to be in for the rest of the day. I thought the doctors appointment would last long enough as my lunch break! Eventually got refered on to the Medical Assessment Unit where Barrie's mum was working.</p><p>Another blood test from the artery this time, which was the most painful, then a very unconfident student nurse came to put a cannula in which was a little unnerving. A doctor came to asses and confirm I had Type I diabetes. She said it is a bit of a life changer. Daddy was yet to be convinced. Daddy was then hooked up to some IV fluids for an hour and then another set which lasted two hours! Meanwhile Farmor had popped in to give some reading material as Daddy was bored out of his brain. Apparently most people with that high a blood glucose level would be feeling ill. Daddy had no ill-affects at all nd didn't feel tired, just very hungry. All that fasting. Two weetabix in the morning and that was it.</p><p>Whilst the drips were plugged in the Diabetic consultant came round and discussed the ins and outs, and becaues Daddy looked sensible (got that wrong!) she instructed him on how, when and quantities on injecting insulin.</p><p>Daddy's main concern was that he had read that it can reduce your life expectancy by 20 years. He was thinking that he would not be old enough so see any great grandchildren! Not sure how accurate the answer I got from the consultant. She made it more 5 years than 20!</p><p>Tomorrow he has another appointment to get more information.</p>

    <title>Walk 6: Watership Down - Elders Over - Hypoglycemic</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Ben went to football with the usual lack of enthusiasm beforehand, and then absolutely loving it when he's playing the match in the second half of the training session. He loves the social interaction and competition, rather than being any good at it. It was raining a little and very muddy. It made Daddy laugh when some of the boys whined when their hands got dirty!</p><p>After footer we headed off on another of our children's walk around London, the fifth one in 3 weeks! This time it was the Watership Down walk, and this time we thought the children were a little young to be introduced to the cartoon. The setting was 50 minutes away on the other side of Kingsclere. Of course the temperature was on freezing and it began to drizzle at the begining of the walk down the road. All in good spirits except of course Jessica. Ben was especially a live wire going up the steep banking, getting his trousers filthy within 10 seconds of setting off and jst loving every second of bein outdoors and being how a child should.</p><p>Mummy followed the map pretty well. We got to Watership Down hill itself and there were millions of rabbit holes. We saw just one rabbit scampering up the hill for about 5 seconds before it disapeared. Taking the pushchair was a bit if a mistake as it was pretty bumpy and constantly at an angle as we traversed the bottom of the hill. Ben was climbing the hill, worrying Mummy as it was quite slippery and steep. Casualty number two quickly came with Katie continually moaning that her feet were cold! So we stopped for a picnic as an attempt to revive the spirits. No joy there though. We climbed the hill and finally reached the top where the gallops were. Ben said that the view was 'excellent'. We had to agree with him. We treked through the mud and finally finished the 2 mile walk in good time. Definately a place to come back to in the summer as there were plenty of trees to climb and I am sure we'd love to do rolly polies down the hill!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_01_22-05-WatershipDown.jpg</src><caption>Rambling down the hill</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_01_22-32-WatershipDown.jpg</src><caption>Benny pointing out the views</caption></image><p>We returned home and the Elders arrived soon after. The news from the hospital ragarding great grandad was not good. He was now unable to communicate and flailing around in bed. It was quite distressing for the family who surrounded him. Mummy decided to go and support Ma Ma and others up on the ward for a number of hours. When she returned she could not offer much other than there is a lot of love of support for great Grandad.</p><p>Meanwhile the children were all playing very well, oblivious to the seriousness of great grandad's condition which helped relieve the anxiety. We made a monster lasagne and pizza for dinner. Joey and Lily stayed in Katie and Ben's bed for a couple of hours before finding alternative sleeping arrangements.</p><p>Daddy's first couple of days of monitoring and administering have been a bit unsatisfactory in terms of results. The daily routine consists of taking a blood sample before a meal and two hours after a meal, as well as one just before bed. That is 7 blood tests. A blood test involves making a small pin prick on the side of a finger, enough to draw blood. The blood is then soaked on a small piece of special card. Depending on the time of day this rading should be between 4 and 9. Daddy's reading have all been between 11 and 15!... except for once, this evening when it fell below 4 and Daddy started to get the shakes. In other words had a mild hypoglycemic attack, even after a huge lasagne! Obviously it had a low GI count. Anyway after eating and drinking some sugary drinks he returned to normal and an hour later his glucose level had risen to 15! The attack came quite suddenly, e.g. One minute feeling fine, the next feeling quite not as himself. As well as the 7 blood tests, Daddy has to take 4 injections of insulin. This is adminstered with a needle and hopefully because he is inexperienced sometimes stings a bit. It is more of an inconvienience than anything else.</p>

    <title>Great Grandad Passes Away</title>
    <info>
		<image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/1960_XX_XX-AlanCarolRichardPeterHoward.jpg</src><caption>Dear Old Grandad</caption></image><p>Today was an extermely sad day with great Grandad passing away. It started very early. The family had kind of said that there were to be 2 family members continually at Grandad's bedside to they could care for any of his needs immediately. Ma ma had done the night shift and Mummy and Ellie went in at 6am to relive her. Unfortunately Grandad's breathing became extremely lengthy, 20 seconds between in each breath. Mummy was holding his hand and talking to Ellie and Uncle Howard on previous events and what a lovely man he was. He passed away peacefully at about 8:30am. The rest of the family were informed and a message passed to the church so they could pray for him.</p><p>When Mummy and Auntie Ellie returned, we decided to get out of the house, have a runabout and get some fresh air. Daddy had another hypoglycemic attack, worse than yesterday's, this time he also got the sweats. Mummy rushed to the shops to get some sugars. That will teach us to take the sugar tablets everywhere with us and to have emergency provisions in the car just in case we forget in the future.</p><p>We told the children the news about great grandad and they seemed to take it well and surprisingly not too much of a reaction at first. Ben asked how the angels are going to get into the hospital. Katie later asked won't the nurses notice that grandad's body has gone [into heaven]. Joey and Lily were discussing whether heaven was in the clouds or in space.</p><p>The most profound remark came out of the blue from Ben later in the afternoon when he said, "I've got a good idea. Why don't we light that candle [in mummy and daddy's room] every Sunday and think about Grandad". What a sweet thought from a 5 year old. Mummy rolled the conversation on and spoke of some of her fond memories of Grandad. Ben recalled gleefully one of the last times he saw great grandad when they played draughts against each other.</p><p>The rest of the day flowed past in numbness. Daddy took Jessica to one of her playschool friend's 3rd birthday party at the biggest house you ever likely to go in. It was huge. An early night was had by all.</p>

    <title>Football, Leah Over To Stay And Two More Birthdays</title>
    <info>
		<p>Leah Sumner came over last night for a sleep over. The two girls didn't go to sleep until past midnight! They played teachers and of course the Nintendo DS.</p><p>In the morning Daddy took Ben to football. Again he was very enthusiastic during the game! So much so he kicked the ball into his own goal from half a yard out! Meanwhile Daddy did his first bit of fitness for over 2 months! He struggled to run 2 miles.</p><p>Next Ben and Jessica went to Wizzy World for Amy's 3rd birthday. Ben suffered a hypoglycemic attack which is a little ironic. Either that or he's cunning at getting a chocolate muffin!</p><p>In the afternoon Katie and Leah went to Leah Rushforth's 8th birthday party, whilst Mummy, Daddy and Ben had a Champion of Champions game of Monopoly. The winner being.... Ben.</p><p>Katie went over to Leah's house to sleep the night.</p>

    <title>Walk 7: Southwark and St Paul's walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we picked Katie up from Leah's and went to church. Daddy and Jessica went over to the Fars. Daddy watched the tennis final whilst Jessica beautified Farfar!</p><p>We headed up to London for the sixth walk. We walked south from our start position of the Monument. Of course Ben first needed the toilet, and ther are not alot of places to go around there, so discretely made use of a disused carpark. Two minutes later Jessica wanted to go. Mummy in her infinite wisdom decided to tip her up by the side of the main road and make use of a drain. It was so embarassing as 5 seconds later a car wanted to turn into the narrow road that Mummy was standing. Therefore the driver had a lovely view of a child weeing all over the road. They hadn't even realized that a car was waiting!</p><p>We continued over London Bridge and hit Southwark Cathedral where we stopped for some food. Daddy had a bit of a hypo so went looking for food. We went into the Cathedral where the choir were singing away.</p><p>Borough market was closed so quickly moved onto the Golden Hind, then down the path to see the Clink prison. Katie was too scared to go down the steps to the entrance!</p><p>Daddy persuaded us to go into the Tate Modern. We saw the controversial sunflower seeds. We couldn't quite work out its artist merit, but that would probably go for 90% of the Tate Modern! Philistines!</p><p>We moved across the Millenium Bridge and stepped inside St Pauls cathedral. We took up Ben's suggestion and lit a candle and thought about Great Grandad up in the sky. We walked around inside a bit. It's pretty big in there,</p><p>We headed back to the car and took 2 hours plus to get home through the A3 traffic!</p>

    <title>Great Grandad's Funeral</title>
    <info>
		<p>Us children were scattered around friends houses after school leaving Mummy and Daddy to attend Great Grandad's funeral. The service was held at 1:15pm at St. Andrew's church, Frimley Green and was very well attended. There must have been about 200 people, which was good considering a lot of his friends had passed away themselves. The coffin draped with an RAF flag, was marched in by his sons' and Pop Pop. Grandma presented a stiff upper lip but like the rest of us found it hard to keep emotions in.</p><p>A number of eulogies were presented by Uncle Richard, Uncle Peter Garratt, an RAF colleague and a friend who had Great Grandad as his best man. They all charted his life at various points. It centred around his travels and work with the RAF and all the various organisations he had either setup or actively participated in right up to the time he contracted cancer. Many were unaware how much work he had done for the community and charity, due to the modesty of Great Grandad. "If the club did not exist, Alan would create one." - "Alan always made me feel very welcome." were a couple of remarks that summed him up.</p><p>After the church service, family were invited to Aldershot crematorium to say our final goodbyes. The reverand held a small service. After we hundled in the cold and looked at the flowers and messages left by close family. The family had requested that if the general congregation wanted to make a donation to the RAF benevolent fund rather than give flowers.</p><p>We headed back to Mytchett bowls club for the wake, which was held in a well spirited atmosphere. Great Grandma was ever so strong and all our support goes to her.</p>

    <title>Walk 8: Ashdown Forest Walk - Outdoor Karting</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy took Ben to football this morning. After which we swiftly left for another of our walks this time in Ashdown Forest, where the Winnie The Pooh stories are set. We pulled up into the car park and noticed another family with the same 'Walks' book as us! Spooky.</p><p>We had lunch in the car, not daring to go out in the not so perfect conditions, this time drizzley and very windy. No pushchair this time, so we had no choice but to go at Jessica's slow pace. We had mixed emotions around the 2 mile circuit. We had Katie absolutely besides herself when she couldn't see us when she decided to take a detour and Ben crying uncontrolably when he hit the mud with a thud when he slipped off a large rope swing.</p><p>However, we had triumphs when both Katie and Ben shinned across fallen trees across the stream. They got real confidence from doing this. Ben of course was particularly proud and thought he was real daring. We did struggle to keep the spirits up high on our journey so skipped the detours to the windmill and waterfall which was a shame. Yet again we mentioned how it would be lovely to come back in the summer when conditions would be more favourable.</p><p>Jessica did particularly well at the end when she climbed unaided, the never ending steep hill back to the top where 'Friends Clump' lay and the car.</p><p>We drove to Ma Ma and Pop Pop's and had a Spag Bol where we met up with the Elders.</p><p>In the evening we went over to Buckmore Park, where Daddy, Uncle Michael and Ryan from work did a 45 minute race on karts which can reach 60-70mph. Daddy had a blistering start and was only 0.007 seconds from pole position out of the 35 drivers. However, the heavens opened and he really struggled to keep the kart on the track spinning on so many occassions, some at high speed. He had quite a few battles with Uncle Michael, and bumped him off the road a number of times! he he. We of course were routing for Daddy and cheered when he passed Uncle Michael. Joey cheered when Michael passed Daddy! Helen, Nigel, Pop Pop and Auntie Ellie all came to watch as well.</p><p>Daddy clawed back a few positions when the weather dried up and ended 6th, 2 places behind Ryan in 4th, but 6 in front of Michael who finished in a respectable 12th.</p><p>
        Here are the <a href="http://www.buckmore.co.uk/content.php/51420?cha_ref=202&amp;eve_ref=5852">results</a>.

    <title>Two more birthdays, Fars, Church Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>We said our goodbyes from Ma Ma and Pop Pop's, and hurried back to basecamp... for about 5 minutes. Mummy and Katie went to Poopy's birthday which was different. It was a horse riding party which Katie absolutely loved. It involved riding through the woods. Meanwhile Daddy biked across the woods with Ben and Jessica and ended up at the Fars. We played with the wooden railway before Ben was taken to Tomlinscote School for one of his friends birthday party.</p><p>Meanwhile Jessica was tucking well into her Sunday roast. First time for roast beef and brussel sprouts. We have now got conclusive proof that Jessie is a food eating dustbin. Not only does she adore porridge, but also a brussel sprout gobbler!</p><p>Later in the afternoon we met up with some of the Barnett's and Elders for the Church New Years party where we had a mixture of quizzes and children's games. We did particularly well with the prizes. A good time had by all.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_02_06-33-ChurchNewYearParty.jpg</src><caption>Katie playing sleeping lions</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_02_06-36-ChurchNewYearParty.jpg</src><caption>The lions sleep tonight</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 9: Leith Hill</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy and Ben went off to football and came back very muddy. Meanwhile Daddy monitored Katie doing her homework. As usual it was a bit of a battle for her to approach it in the right attitude so Daddy had to gently remind her how important it was to put all her effort into it, if nothing else it would mean she could go back on to her DS quicker!</p><p>This week's homework was in three parts:</p><ul><li><i>Maths</i>Katie had a list of about 30 numbers and had to round each to the nearest 100. She did well, but needed help when the number in question was in the 1000's.
        </li><li><i>Spelling</i>This week's 10 words were: Properly, Eventually, Originally, Friendly, Lovely, Likely,
        </li><li><i>Reading</i>Katie had read a chapter, about 5 - 10 minutes of her book. She tripped on a few words, but we believe she is quite proficient.
        </li></ul><p>After an early lunch we headed to Leith Hill, Surrey's highest point for another of our walks. For once conditions were nice enough so that the children could not moan, it was sunny and not too cold, and we even managed a pushchair! The start of this 3 miler saw us climb up this big old hill, which made Mummy quite breathless. We put it to the state of her fitness, she put it down to her asthma.</p><p>Once we reached the cricket ground we took a wrong turning and from the time we realized Mummy was on a crazy mission to get us to the hallowed tower for 3pm, often leaving Katie and Ben in some tree or Daddy helping a very slow Jessica on foot. It all got a bit embarrassing at the tower with Mummy running around paniced and barking orders at Jessica and Daddy to hurry up as the tower was about to close. Anyway funnily enough we made it with plenty of time to spare and climbed to the top. The views were magnificent. We were able to see London to the north and a lot of countryside everywhere else!</p><p>We hung about at the tower for a while, eating some much needed supplies, Ben and Katie continuing the great tree climb fest! We headed back down the hill and for the next 2 miles we barely saw anyone else, the occasional dog walker and mountain biker. We all played World War II, daddy was the only one on the Germans side and so was attacked with sticks (guns) and even bigger sticks (aeroplanes).</p><p>We finally returned to the car not before jumping in puddles and getting completely soaked. We had a quick 15 minutes in a nearby playground before it got dark and home time.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_02_12-00-LeithHill.jpg</src><caption>Collage of Leith Hill</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_02_12-15a-LeithHill.jpg</src><caption>Group shot</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_02_12-08-LeithHill.jpg</src><caption>Two monkies in a tree</caption></image>

    <title>Joey's 6th birthday, Leah R's Mormon Baptism</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Daddy went to work and we went off to church. In the afternoon we split, Mummy and Katie went to Leah Rushforths baptism. It was slightly different as it was a Mormon baptism.</p><p>The rest of the crew headed over to Joey's birthday party in Alton. It was held at the Leisure Centre and consisted mainly of the boys in Joey's class.... and what a lot of naughty boys they were. Ellie and Michael did well to keep them under control. We had various games, including: Paper Aeroplane competition, British Bulldog, Stuck in the mud, corners and a hearty game of football.</p><p>We headed to the cafe for some food and to sing happy birthday to Joey. We headed back and had our bath at the Fars and waited for Mummy and Katie to pick us up.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_02_13-11-Joey6thBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Joey blowing out his candles</caption></image>

    <title>Jessica injections</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today Jessica had an injection at the top of each arm. She was so cute, she buried her head in Mummy's top and didn't speak and didn't cry during the first injection. However, she did cry during the second one. She was pretty pleased at getting two stickers for her troubles. Her 'Baby' now takes 'tend jections' (pretend injections).</p>

		<p>In the morning it was Daddy's turn to take Ben to football and boy it was muddy. Later in the afternoon Daddy had all three of us in the swimming pool at Farnborough. Ben is really coming on with his swimming, actually now being able to do a few strokes. Daddy was also coerced into playing Super Mario Bros on the DS!</p>

    <title>Walk 10: Christmas Common Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>We embarked on another of our walks after church, this time in Oxfordshire's Christmas Common. It was extrememly muddy as we trekked through the woods. We had a great time going through the puddles and mud and running all over. Most of the walk was done going up narrow lanes and tracks. We did wonder into the woods and across a couple of farmers fields. Of course we all got wet feet even though we had our wellies on. We did enjoy ourselves, but proably our least favourite outing.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_02_20-16-ChristmasCommonWalk.jpg</src><caption>Leaving us!</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_02_20-03-ChristmasCommonWalk.jpg</src><caption>Katie and Jess Horsing around</caption></image>

		<p>Daddy has the week off work and so is about to play with. Today Thomas, Natasha and of course Fiona came over to play. Thomas was straight on the attack with one of his lightsabres. Jessica hooked up with Natasha and played babies. After lunch Daddy made a treasure hunt which took us around the estate and finally ended up at the playground and we had a good run around on the green.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_02_21-02-BurrowsTreasureHunt.jpg</src><caption>Found a clue</caption></image>

    <title>Daddy to Jutland, Denmark</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy joined the Fars on a day trip to Denmark. Yes a day trip to the mighty Billund airport which is smack bang in the middle of Jutland, the pinisula poking up from Germany.</p><p>We left at 4:05am and by the time we got to Red Road Farfar was bemoaning the slowness of the car infront! However, we made Standsted in good time and took our Ryanair flight without any issues. No stops to explain taking a syringe and needles!</p><p>We landed and walked out into a -5 centigrade wall of coldness. A full 10 degrees difference to home, plus some windchill factor as well. There was snow on the ground, but the Danes handle it very well. Even the cycle paths are gritted!</p><p>We collected our hire car and headed first to Grinsted for some 10 o'clock breakfast. A typical town, full of no traffic and no people it seemed. After Daddy recovered from a hypo, we found a cafe type place which was a little out of the ordinary. It happened to be a lady's 50th birthday so it was an open house. Free food. Result. Not only that, there was a great Danish meal time atmosphere and the food was absolutely what the doctor ordered at that time. Some lovely oat type breads, granary rolls, pastries and of course a flask of coffee. Daddy really enjoyed it there.</p><p>After swanning around the shop we had to quickly move on if we were to complete our missions today. Daddy took over the driving and Farfar the navigating. We headed to the west coast and a place translated to White Sands (Hvide Sande). It was quite literally 'white sands' as the snow covered the beach. We stopped half way up this spit of land and looked in a couple of fish shops, one with live lobsters in it. Can't take anything back unfortunately. Farmor treated us to a Fish buffet in a nice restaurant for lunch. We had everything from King Eel, Salmon, Prawns, Herring, Mackeral and some other fish which I don't know what they really were. It was interesting chatting to some locals who reacalled eating fish for breakfast 4 times a week when their family worked as fisherman.</p><p>Farmor and Daddy went for a walk on the beach which only lasted 10 minutes because it was so unbeliveably, bitterly cold. Daddy's ear almost frooze off!</p><p>Time was marching on and a realization that we were not going to do everything planned came upon us. So top priority was..... going to some charity shop over an hour away! So be it. We eventually got to Them, and as charity shops go, it was alright, not one Daddy would step into even if it was down Frimley high street. Still the Fars rated it, and for all our efforts and sacrifices, the only thing purchased was a pair of clogs for £3!</p><p>A trip with the Fars always includes a Ying and Yang match up between Farfar wanting to squeeze in another destination, usually at the cost of arriving on time at the final destination, against Farmor's arrive in plenty of time approach. As usual Farfar got his way and we stopped off in Ejstrupholm and had a bit of a comedy moment as Daddy and Farfar ran around a graveyard looking for Daddy's Great Grandparents headstone which had moved since the last time they were there. They only had 5 minutes to find it. The stopwatch chimed and they had to abort and rush to get diesel and return back to the airport.</p><p>We arrived back in England at 8pm and all that Mummy was interested in was what presents were bought for her, and of course the children!</p><p>A thoroughly enjoyable day with some nice food and a little taste of Denmark along with a splattering of humour with the Fars!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_02_22-11-JutlandRoadMap.jpg</src><caption>Jutland 1 day Road trip</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 11: Roald Dahl Museum, Long Walk, Sleepovers</title>
    <info>
		<p>We picked Katie up from a sleepover at Natashas's and headed off to Great Missenden for another of our walks, the Roald Dahl walk. First we headed into town and went to the Roald Dahl Museum, which seemed quite popular. We've read quite a few of his books and thought it would be fun to go in. There was stuff to do with the kiddies, dressing up as the characters, making stories up from fridge magnets, listening / acting out the stories and various other crafty stuff. It kept us going for an hour and a half.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_02_24-02-Missenden.jpg</src><caption>Danny Champion Of The World petrol station in Gt. Missenden High Street</caption></image><p>The swings was the next stop along with some picnic activities. I swear Ben is the clumsiest boy that ever lived. His brain and body are not connected as one. He splilt half a pack of crisps just by walking along. Not sure how he done that. Anyway we headed next to the church and visited Roald's grave before moving onto Little Missenden to start our 4 mile trek! It was a mud fest. Ben slipped over in the mud at least 10 times, and Katie got stuck in a big puddle and then fell in it!... and didn't we know about it! The walk was pleasant enough, taking in Fantastic Mr Foxes farm. Mud and puddles were a bit of a problem. At first all very jovielle up until the point Katie got stuck in a muddy puddle, try to heave herself out and ended up getting a little wet. Anyone would have thought she was drowning. Mummy rushing over to save her! Goodness me what a performance. 'I want to go home' and all that. After a calming down period of apprximately 15 minutes, we continued through farmers fields, muddy paths and kissing gates. Someone always gets the bum deal and has to kiss Daddy, who gives out licks rather than kisses! Urrgghhh.</p><p>We saw some Red Kites, all large birds now are Red Kites because we can't tell the difference between them all. We saw a phesant in the middle of the path, which scurried off when we got near to him and the usual sheep, cows and horses.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_02_24-30-Missenden.jpg</src><caption>Danny Champion Of The World petrol station in Gt.

Missenden High Street</caption></image><p>Four miles was more than enough and after 3 or 4 hours we finally made it back to the car where we had to de-gown our muddy apparel.</p><p>We went straight over to the Fars where we spent the night.</p>

    <title>Football, Teale's, Elder's, Henry's Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie and Summer said they didn't go to sleep until gone 1am last night. In the morning Daddy took Ben to a real muddy football practice. Farmor popped by and watched for 15 minutes or so.</p><p>The Teale's came over to pick up Summer who was a really good girl. A pleasure to have over. She played so nicely with Katie. Anyway the Elder clan also came over so we had a bumper lunch. After lunch Mummy and Jessica went over to Henry's birthday party at Heatherside community centre. We saw Lorraine there so it was nice to catch up.</p><p>Meanwhile the rest of us went to visit Great Grandma briefly then we went along with the Elders to Manor Park, Aldershot where we tried out a new skate park. Well new to us. There were plenty of roughians there which Daddy had to be wary of as one of the kids borrowed Ben's bike. We could also hear the crowd at the football club which was quite something for us to hear. Ben was very proud of the fact he was the only one stupid or brave enough to go down the ramp on his scooter.</p>

    <title>Daddy To Work, Katie at party</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy has had a pretty stressful week at work where some of the product was not working as it should, so had spent a couple of days at Victoria station. Everything was working fine when he'd left on Thursday night. Come Friday at 2pm, it was not working again, therefore Daddy had to go back up today as 4 months worth of work was going to be let off to the users on Monday morning for the first time. Anyway Daddy got it working in an area that he was not responsible for. Daddy also went over to see Barrie who was having a spot of bother.</p><p>Meanwhile after dropping Daddy off at the station, we went off to Ben's football. We lasted just 5 minutes, before everyone moaned at the bitter conditions. It was -1 degrees. Therefore we returned home and played.</p><p>In the afternoon we dropped Katie off at McDonalds in Camberley as it was Nina's party. We then went to watch Gnomeo and Julliet at the cinema.</p><p>We had some surprise visitors later in the afternoon: Ma Ma, Pop Pop, Uncle Peter and Grandma as well as Farfar came around for a cup of tea and a piece of cake.</p><p>We picked Daddy up from the station and snuggled down in the evening and we all watched Carrie's War, which Katie had recommended from her school work.</p>

		<p>Because Daddy was kind of on call for work we thought it better to stick around the house today. Just he and Katie stayed at home in the morning doing jobs and homework, whilst the rest of us went to church.</p><p>In the afternoon we played on a maths website recommended to us by Ben's school and went outside to play on our bikes and have a go on the swing. The weather was still bitterly cold so we didn't last too long.</p>

    <title>Bob A Job</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ben went to football and Katie, Jessica and Mummy played at the swings and Daddy went for a jog. This week Katie had to do jobs for Bob A Job week at Brownies in aid of Red Nose day. So we decided to go to our friends and families houses in order to do jobs for a pound. We went to Auntie Sue's and Uncle Richard's house where Katie and Ben sorted out pens. After, Mummy went to the Meadows and dressed up in a funny outfit, rattling a collection tin for Marie Curie (cancer charity). She did look funny. The rest of us went to Auntie Susan's and Uncle Graham's house and cleaned their car. Katie was given a £10 note for this job. We played on their PlayStation which had an addon, a bit like XBox Connect, where we could wave in front of the TV which would affect what would happen on screen. We went to collect Mummy and spent our £1 on sweets and a ball.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_03_12-03-BobAJob.jpg</src><caption>Mummy looking funny</caption></image><p>We then went over to the Sanders and saw new baby Joshua who was asleep when we arrived, but Mummy bulldozed her way in to pick him up straight away. Joshua started to cry! He was such a cutie and we all loved a cuddle. We cleared out  a couple of kitchen cupboards for Auntie Karen to earn our Red Nose money. We played for a little bit, then woke Evie up so Jessica was happy to gain her playmate. We took some family pictures and left the Sanders who had been unindated with visitors for 3 days.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_03_12-11-BobAJob.jpg</src><caption>The all new Sanders Crew</caption></image><p>We then made our final trip over to Farmors where she had a spot of gardening for us to do. I think it is the first time ever that mummy did some gardening! In the evening as we couldn't find a baby sitter, so Mummy and Katie went out to the church quiz, whilst the boys stayed up late and watched the TV.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_03_12-00-BobAJob.jpg</src><caption>All Katie's Bob A Jobs</caption></image>

Meanwhile Daddy took Jessica over to Purley for Natasha's 3rd birthday party. We had a great time playing hide and seek and bouncing on the castle. As ever with a Burrows birthday party there were lots of children.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_03_13-09-Natasha3rdBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Natasha blowing the candles out on her cake</caption></image><p>After bedtime Mummy and Daddy found Ben in Katie's bed, with Katie's clothes on.

    <title>Walk 12: Horse Riding, Chawton Walk, Elders Dinner</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy went out with his old friends last night and didn't come home until 1:30am.</p><p>We had a busy morning, first up was Ben's football down at the park next to the hospital. Mummy and Jessica played in the playground. Meanwhile Daddy and Katie went over to the Fars house for a quick cup of tea before moving on to Katie's first horse riding lesson over in Pirbright. Kaite had gone to Poppy's horsey birthday party and really enjoyed riding. Ma Ma was very enthusiastic in giving Katie some additional riding experiences and so treated her to a lesson. We met with Poppy at the livery. We were assigned Ash who needed a good grooming. Katie rode off with two elder riders through the woods. Daddy stayed behind. Half an hour later, they returned, Katie trotting away on Ash. Very impressive to be trotting Daddy thought. Katie was a little quiet, but did seem to have enjoyed her morning. We've booked up again for 2 weeks time.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_03_19-04-ChawtonWalk.jpg</src><caption>Katie mounting Ash</caption></image><p>Mummy, Ben and Jessica walked home up the big hill and waited for Daddy and Katie to return so we could have lunch all together.</p><p>In the afternoon we popped over to Alton to pick Lily up. On our way to Chawton we saw a couple of escaped horses running up and down the main road which gave much ammusement to the children. Goodness knows what happened to them. We finally made it to Chawton where we met up with Auntie Ellie. This was the location for the start of another of our family walks. The Jane Austen walk. The first time we took pasangers, and definately we had the best conditions. No cold, no rain and no mud! Chawton is picturesque and Daddy got plenty of snaps of us. Ben and Lily played together alot and collected stones, and sticks for weapons. We reached Upper Farringdon where we stopped for a spot of food and a play on the swings. It was a lovely sunny day. Katie then decided she had a blister, which meant all change in terms of who went in the pushchair! We finally made it back and had another play on the swings.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_03_19-11-ChawtonWalk.jpg</src><caption>Katie, Lily and Ben on the Chawton Walk</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_03_19-48-ChawtonWalk.jpg</src><caption>The four hounds stumped</caption></image><p>We went back to the Elders house played, had dinner then went to bed. The grown ups had a lovely dinner themselves followed by Trivial Pursuit which the girls luckily won!</p>

    <title>Football, Walk 13: Wildhill Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>The weather was glorious this morning. Ben was well up for football and played really well. He got stuck in and made some good tackles, always going to ground when making a tackle. He mudded himself up which would please mummy! Anyway he won Man Of The Match which really pleased him.</p><p>We then went off for another of our walks this time near Hatfield. The connection with children, well it was where Beatrix Potter spent some of her holidays. We started in the middle of nowhere in Wildhill and walked and walked and walked. We played over a stream. Ben was pronouncing his bravery as he walked the logs over the stream. Jessica even had a go. Mummy and Katie wimped out! Anyway we struggled to the end after about 4 hours.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_03_26-15-WildhillWalk.jpg</src><caption>Wildhill Walk 1</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_03_26-32-WildhillWalk.jpg</src><caption>Wildhill Walk 2</caption></image><p>In the early evening, Ma Ma, Pop Pop, Uncle Peter and Great Grandma came over very briefly before they moved onto a barn dance.</p>

    <title>Kayaking, Jessica at birthday party, Bonfire</title>
    <info>
		<p>Finally Daddy had an opportunity to go on his Kayak. After a lot of phaffing around hooking the kayak onto the car, the rest of us, plus Great Grandma arrived at church in style! Daddy then went onto the Canal centre in Mytchett and cracked a bottle of champaigne for the maiden voyage. Will not quite champaigne. Daddy was glad nobody was around as he struggled and wrestled the boat into the canal. It took just over half an hour to reach the big bridge at Deepcut where he turned around and came back again. He achieved his first voyage without drama and so can take passangers!</p><p>Next up after church was yet another birthday party for Jessica to attend. This time it was Isabella's 4th birthday party. She was very cute. The organiser announced the game of Sleeping Lions. Jessica said she was good at this, and immediately went into the coma position. However, all the other children didn't really want to play, so the organiser canceled the game. However, Jessica still lay on the floor. She was rewarded with a sweet for kind of winning the game.</p><p>Later in the afternoon, Daddy, Ben and Jessica all went over to Chertsey with the Fars to have a mini bonfire. The land at the back of the club had a lot of cut down brambled bushes and stuff which all needed disposing of. An ideal oppotunity to have a fire. We loved putting the bits of wood onto the fire.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_03_27-08-Bonfire.jpg</src><caption>Super Hot </caption></image><p>Ben, since winning man of the match has been really enthusistic about playing football and made such a marked difference in playing the game. He's played against both Mummy and Daddy over the weekend. We played on the pitch with some mini goals. Ben won yet again 20 - 15. He was actually trying his skills and go around Daddy, rather than before where he'd just boot the ball whenever he got close to challenging someone. There is hope yet that he'll be a footballer.</p>

    <title>Football, Horse Riding, Kayaking, Ma Ma's, E.T</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy and Ben were first out of the house off to the last Saturday morning football training session. Ben was getting into it and loved it. It's going to switch to Wednesday evenings in May.</p><p>Meanwhile the gilrs went off to horse riding. This week Katie had Bess and went straight to the jumps. Little jumps, but jumps none the less. Ma Ma and Pop Pop took Katie and Jessica and went off. Ma Ma and Pop Pop went back to Kent and first bought Katie some jodpers, then went off to Satin's restuarant for some McGrease. They walked off their lunch down at Gravesend Prom, went to the swings then came home and played in the garden. At 4pm both Jessica and Katie went off to ride on Tiki. In the evening they snuggled up to watch the Little Mermaid, Jessica covered her eyes up with a cushoin for most of the performance as she was a little scared.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_02-19-HorseRiding.jpg</src><caption>Horse Jump</caption></image><p>Mummy lost a game of Temptation so had to come on the Kayak trip with Daddy and Ben. We set off from Datchet and paddled upstream. When I say paddled, there was one paddler and two non paying passengers. One paddler, one non paying passenger, and Captain Herr Flick! After an hour or so we reached a lock which was quite exciting. We eventually reached Windsor and stopped off on the Eton side of the river and climbed a tree for half an hour. The return leg was twice as quick. A nice trip.</p><p>In the evening we sat down to watch E.T. Well we've never seen someone cry so much through a film as our Benny. Perhaps a little premature to introduce our most sensitive offspring.</p>

		<p>We woke late and mummy got a cup of tea in bed and at least Ben's present, which was a load of chocolate, which were demolished within about 10 minutes.</p><p>Mummy went to church with Ben, whilst Daddy went to wish Farmor a happy mothers day.</p><p>In the afternoon we went to Frmiley Lodge Park and met up with the Fars, Ma Ma, Pop Pop, The Elders, Phil and Emma, Grandma and Peter. We played in the playground, went on the steam train, then went around the trim trail before ending up in the cafe grabbing an ice cream!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_04-55-FrimleyLodgePark.jpg</src><caption>Hanging around</caption></image>

    <title>Ben's Football Tournament, Paula's BBQ</title>
    <info>
		<p>On this fine summery day we first cleaned the inside of the car, and boy it was grotty. Loads of crumbs and food in all nooks and crannies.</p><p>Daddy took Jessica on the back of his bike and joined Katie who cycled the scenic route to Frimley Green to pick up Daddy and Great Grandmas perscription. We delivered it to Great Grandma had a banana and fixed her hoover, before moving on back home, late!</p><p>Ben had a 5 a-side football tournament with his Saturday morning lot, all in aid of one of the committee members who died earlier in the year. He played four games, and is really starting to improve his enjoyment and contribution to the game. I think he likes the team aspect as well as being competitive and physical, more than the skills of the game. After 4 games he picked up his trophy for taking part and he and Daddy joined the rest at Paula's BBQ.</p><p>We felt honoured to be invited as the other guests all had known Paula and Simon for 15+ years it seemed. Daddy turned up to see Mummy sloshing the Rose back! Oh no this was only heading one way. The children all played very nicely with each other. Muumy and Daddy could relax! By the end Mummy managed to finish off a bottle of wine and even had room for a bottle of beer. Mummy asleep by 9pm. Kaaabooom.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_09-27-BenFootballTournament.jpg</src><caption>Ben picking up his first football trophy</caption></image>

		<p>No Sunday school this week, Ben was the only dedicated disciple who wanted to join Mummy at church. In the afternoon we went over to the Fars for our previously postponed Sunday lunch. The weather was glorious so we were able to sit out in the back garden and enjoy our delicious roast Lamb. We had bits of a whole Lamb that Farmor bought. It has got to be the best lamb I've ever tasted. Mmmm. We made our customary mess in the back garden and played polo and please Mr. Crocodile.</p><p>We returned home in the late afternoon, and prepared for our Licolnshire holiday tomorrow.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_10-09-FarsSundayLunch.jpg</src><caption>Sunday lunch at the fars</caption></image>

    <title>Lincolnshire Holiday: Walk 14: Children Of Green Knowe walk, travel to Mablethorpe</title>
    <info>
		<p>It must be experience, but we must have been the most prepared we've ever been on a 4 night stay away. It was all pretty calm on the morning of us leaving. We'd booked a holiday via the newspaper, supposidly being extremely cheap, but really still costing over £100 just in accommodation. Still it managed to win Mummy over and she'd selected Licolnshire as our destination, well known for it's good April climate! We popped over to the Fars to pick up the National Trust cards, then got on the M3 and was welcomed by the Monday morning London bound traffic! It wasn't too bad after a bit and we sailed our way up to Cambridgeshire, where we planned to do another of our walks from 'the book'. On the way we stopped to stretch our legs and have a go on the swing park at Papworth Everard.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_11-06-LincolnshireHoliday-HemingfordWalk.jpg</src><caption>Playing at the swing park</caption></image><p>Our walk started at Hemingford Abbot, and we stopped by the river bank immediately for a picnic. It was all very picturesque and serene, well as much as it can be with us lot. The 3.5 mile walk took around the Great River Oose and some of it's contributies. We walked passed an old water mill, went over some bridges. Ben ran off to play on a tree which was ladened with stinging nettles. Well you know what is going to hapen next.... well a little boy did fall into the nettles but it wasn't Ben! Still we helped collect dock leaves for the boy who was screaming in pain. We then hit a field of cows which we had to walk through. Mummy's hackles were up and any little attempt of humour such as Moo or 'quick the cows are coming', Mummy got in a mood and quickened her step away from the animals. We all laughed at her. We completed the scenic walk, our best for a while.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_11-10-LincolnshireHoliday-HemingfordWalk.jpg</src><caption>Picnicing around</caption></image><p>We jumped in the car headed north, past Peterborough and Boston. We eventually found our Haven park, Golden Sands, Maplethorpe, got our caravan and settled in. We could not however get the oven to work and we had bought pizzas for tea. In the end it was getting late and the kids wanted to go to the disco so Mummy took them hoping the pizzas would be cooked when we got back. However, they weren't so Daddy and Katie went to get Fish and Chips.</p>

    <title>Lincolnshire Holiday: Pleasure Island Theme Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy decided that we should go Pleasure Island, a theme park 30 miles away up the coast towards Cleethorpes. We arrived to find it shut! After some phaffing around in shops and stuff, Daddy wanted to take the opportunity to go to Grimsby and see tbe fishing markets and docks. However, there was no market to speak of, but went around the dock area which was very interesting. Quite industrial and obviously it had seen better days, with half the units being empty. However what had survived was great. Walking around the back of the units you saw crates of fish heads. There was loads of rubbish. Anyway the other four were fast becoming bored so we had to leave and head back to camp. On the way home we stopped off for lunch in a playground at Grainthorpe.</p><p>We went to use the camp facilities in the afternoon. First the softplay, then adventure playground, the swimming pool and the crazy golf, before ending up in the ballroom for the Rory and the Dragon stage production. All the children enjoyed it, and now we feel Jessica is old enough to enjoy a pantomime. We quickly headed back to the static to have pizza (we got the gas cooker working), then Mummy, Katie and Ben returned to the ballroom to see a magic show. This show was slightly different in that they showed how to do the tricks. When we returned home to Daddy we tried some tricks on him. We got everyone wrong! Oh well. Daddy stayed back to listen to the Man Utd vs Chelsea game.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_12-11-LincolnshireHoliday-MabelthorpeBeach.jpg</src><caption>Mablethorpe Beach</caption></image>

    <title>Lincolnshire Holiday: Pleasure Island</title>
    <info>
		<p>We returned to Cleethorpes in search of an open theme park. We got there before the gates opened so there was a bit of a queue. Although it was sunny, and we even managed to catch the sun, the North Sea winds were cutting through the 10 degrees temperature. Entrance price of £66 was reasonably good value. It is hard to describe the position which Pleasure Island stands in the ladder of theme parks. It is not quite as well established as the southern efforts or Drayton Manor, however it had a lot more to offer than Paulton's Park or Alice In Wonderland. More importantly it had something to offer all of us, more than expected for Jessica. Not sure if it was because it was the first day of opening for the year or because of the cool temperature, but there weren't lots of people inside the park. We didn't have to queue more than 15 minutes for any of the rides. Jessica enjoyed the catapillar rollercoaster and big slide the best, Katie the Gravitron and Ben everything that was fast and G-Force intensive! We spent the whole day on rides. Daddy now feeling old as his yurning for thrill rides has been overtaken by the effects on his stomach! We had a really great family day, many of the rides we could all do together. There were rides which the bigger parks wouldn't be able to cope with due to the number of  people. e.g. Both Katie and Ben went on the water walkers. Brilliant. We stopped when the gates closed at 5pm. We returned back to the camp and went off to watch a Cinderella pantomime in the ballroom. Another full day.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_13-31-LincolnshireHoliday-PleasureIsland.jpg</src><caption>Grit And Determination</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_13-48-LincolnshireHoliday-PleasureIsland.jpg</src><caption>Slide Race</caption></image>

    <title>Lincolnshire Holiday: Castles and Skeggy</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Daddy took all three of us swimming in a packed pool. We played a good game of sharks where Daddy was only allowed to catch us on the knee and had to drag us half way down the pool. He never managed it!</p><p>Mummy overruled Daddy on the destination of today. Today we headed off to Tattershall Castle. We went the scenic route through the Licolnshire contryside. We passed just one car in 30 minutes of driving. We eventually got there only to find it shut. If only we kept to the original itinary which had checked this out. We stayed in the grounds for a spot of lunch. Mummy had a nice pear!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_14-08-LincolnshireHoliday-TatershallBollingwoodCastleSkegness.jpg</src><caption>Tatershall Castle</caption></image><p>We then headed east to Bolingwood castle, a former royal castle, however, now ruined we played a few games of 40/40. We had a great laugh.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_14-22-LincolnshireHoliday-TatershallBollingwoodCastleSkegness.jpg</src><caption>Katie Horsing Around</caption></image><p>Whilst we were up here we had to go and see the ol' so embrassing Skegness. Our thoughts of another seaside town that was tacky, rundown and had seen better days. We were pleasantly surprised, as it was pretty popular, the town looked pretty respectable, the fairground bit had been given a fresh lick of paint and had some decent rides and it was quite tacky. Great Grandma had given each of us £3.30 spending money. Jessica spent it in the arcade on sit on rides and sweets, Ben bought a Bow and Arrow set, then asked 30 minutes later if we had the receipt to take it back, and Katie spent it on sweets and the arcades as well. There was a nice park next to the seafront which we went in, before returning back to the car via the pier and swings. Plenty for us to see there.</p><p>We hurried home and Daddy stoked up the BBQ before going over for the evening entertainments, Another show, a fancydress competition and a science show. Ben's dancing in the intervening breaks was something to witness. Had Mummy and Daddy in stitches. That boy!</p>

		<p>We started the day packing for home. Before leaving we had another cheeky hours worth in the swimming pool and adventure playground. Our long journey home was split up with a stop in a housing estate in Peterborough where there was a nice swing park. We stopped there for lunch also. We eventually made it home via the Friday rushhour (the M1 was shut). Luckily mummy had ordered the shopping online before we left. For once we can say good thinking mummy.</p><p>Overall we had a lovely time. The children really enjoyed themselves and it was nice to go somewhere differnt.</p>

		<p>We all went off to watch Katie do her 3rd lesson today. All three of us helped groom Bess at the start. Katie was trusted to not be led, this may have been a mistake as the horse wouldn't do what Katie wanted and naughty Bess cantered off down the track and felled poor Katie. Thankfully Katie was not hurt and still wants to carry on.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_16-02-HorseKayak.jpg</src><caption>Bess Being Groomed</caption></image><p>In the afternoon we went off to Datchet to drop Daddy off who Kayaked down to the Sprayground, 4 miles away. He really needs to sort out some back support. It was nice to see all the posh houses backing on to the Thames. Meanwhile the rest of drove to the Sprayground and played. Ben managed to tred in the hugest dogs muck ever with just his sandals on!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_16-07-HorseKayak.jpg</src><caption>Ben sunbathing on the Gay cruise liner</caption></image>

    <title>London Marathon</title>
    <info>
		<p>We left mid morning to go up to London again, parking at Clapham South and tubing and DLR'ing it up to Canary Wharf. There were massive crowds again and we got there early enough such that we got a front row position and watched the men's leaders go by. They ran at a high pace. I think quicker than mummy and daddy could sprint! As we were watching the leaders go by, there were not many fancy dressers, which was the bit we were interested in. However, there was so much admiration for the runners who went past, and the support was phenominal.</p><p>We stayed at Canary Wharf for an hour or so, the 20 mile marker, before moving on south to Crossharbour where we had a bit more space and watched some of the fancy dressers and backmarkers. By now half the participants were walking and half slow jogging. We saw rhinos, Elvises, a rubiks cube, a policeman, superheros, children's cartoon characters and our favourite a london bus!</p><p>We were on the look out for Katie's headmaster, Mr Peace, and Steve Laidlaw. However, unfortunately we did not see either.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_17-11-LondonMarathon.jpg</src><caption>Canary runners</caption></image>

    <title>Rainham Marshes</title>
    <info>
		<p>Written by Ma Ma</p><p>Ma Ma and Great Grandma arrived at The Gay's house at about 10.00am and had a nice cup of coffee before setting off on our long journey. Ma Ma had a SAT Nav so we typed in the postcode and set off. Katie and Jess were travelling in Mama 's car and Ben in Laura's. The weather was scorching and we very quickly had the windows wide open. Mama's only clue to the day was that the place we were going to was in Essex. Unfortunately the two cars soon got parted and when the SAT NAV told Mama to turn off at the Swanley Junction she didn't dare for fear that Laura would not know what to do once she reached the Dartford Tunnel! Katie and Jess were fantastic and did not whinge or whine once - even though it was hot and boring in the traffic jam. In fact Jessie slept nearly all the way with her little head tipping upwards. Anyway eventually the two cars met again and after a short discussion it was decided that they would find the first available place for a picnic. Apparantently they should have been heading for the Ada Cole Hourse Sanctuary. A few hundred yards up the road they came to Rainham Marshes. What an amazing place. After a luscious picnic prepared by the most wonderful girl in the world (except for Ellie and Charlotte should they be reading this) we decided to go pond dipping. Unfortunately it was rather a long walk and poor Grandma's legs got a bit achey, but it was worth it. Ben even caught a fish it his net!</p><p>After a play on the super swings and an ice cream we set off for home. Lucky old Mama was nearly there but the rest set off for Surrey tired but happy and Ma Ma would like to say a huge THANK YOU to her darling family who make life so wonderful for her!</p>

    <title>Easter Workshop, Kayaking, Horton Country Park, Katie Sleepover</title>
    <info>
		<p>Good Friday and Mummy, Katie and Ben went to church for the Easter workshop where we made various crafty bits and pieces, including an Easter card, some buscuits, hot cross buns, some egg nest thing, and an easter bunny mask.</p><p>Meanwhile Daddy and Jessica Kayaked up the Basingstoke Canal from Mytchett to Ash Vale and back again. We saw Duncan jogging which was a nice surprise. Jessica even had a go at paddling. The weather was glorious.</p><p>After lunch, We left Daddy at home whilst the rest of us went to meet up with Karen, Summer and Alice at Horton Country park. It was quite a stressful trip with a long walk in the hot weather as well as a broken down car to sort out.</p><p>Katie went back with Summer to stay the night. They played and played and Katie did not go to bed until 4:10am!!</p>

    <title>Katie at Ma Ma's, Daddy watch Chertsey, Heatherside Swings, West BBQ, Ben and Jess and the Fars</title>
    <info>
		<p>Karen, Summer and Katie took a bike ride to the sweet shop in the morning, before handing Katie over to Ma Ma and Pop Pop. In the afternoon they went to Gravesend shopping, then had lunch in the back garden. Pop Pop bet Katie that she wouldn't last out on a long bike ride through some country lanes towards Cobham. Both Ma Ma and Pop Pop were impressed on how Katie managed to complete the 5 mile circuit of course stopping to wait for Ma Ma to get up the hills and a swift refuel at the Leather Bottle public house! In the evening they all watched Fantastic Mr Fox.</p><p>Daddy went to watch Cove V Chertsey in an important league game. Chertsey needed to win to have any hope of becoming champions. They drew in a disapointing game.</p><p>Mummy, Ben and Jessica went to the new swing park at Heatherside. We were quite impressed although a little sad to see the old one go.</p><p>In the evening Mummy and Daddy had a rare evening out together over at the West's for a BBQ. Ben and Jessica went to the Fars to stay the night. Unfortunately they both wet the bed.... Ben and Jess that is!</p>

    <title>Easter Lunch and Peter's in the Afternoon</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy went to get Jessica and Ben early so we could decorate our eggs which we then didn't eat!</p><p>We'd invited the Weston and Elder family for an Easter lunch. A lovely beef meal prepared by Mummy. The weather was glorious which allowed us to eat out in the back garden. The Easter eggs steadily came in.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_24-07-EasterDay.jpg</src><caption>Easter lunch</caption></image><p>In the afternoon we went over to Uncle Peter's where the rest of the Barnett family were congregating. It was not long before water pistols turned into a paddling pool, which turned into Ben controlling check point Charlie with a hose pipe. Ben revelled in this power. It was not long before Jessica and Katie got involved and eveyone got a smattering of water, including Great Grandma!</p><p>On one occassion Auntie Sue thought she'd made it through as Ben was not looking. Pop Pop gave Ben the hint, Ben immediately swooshed around with the hose pipe and splashed his poor victim. In retaliation, Auntie Sue chased Pop Pop around the garden and through a glass of white wine over him. It was very funny.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_24-32-EasterDay.jpg</src><caption>Easter lunch</caption></image>

    <title>The Vyne</title>
    <info>
		<p>Another glorious day awaited outside. In the morning we popped into Camberley for a spot of shopping.</p><p>It was nice for the five of us to have an afternoon together just ourselves. I think for the past 5 or 6 years we've gone off to a National Trust place to do the Easter Egg trail. This year we continued the tradition and went to The Vyne just outside Basingstoke.</p><p>Ben has a tendency to wait to the very last moment before he realises he needs the toilet... and normally when we are out and about we have to find the nearest bush so he can releve himself. Embarrassingly there was urgency at one point and Ben sprinkled the bush right by the first clue. That meant everyone doing the Easter Egg trail would be right by Ben's wee.</p><p>Anyway we circled the lake, toured the house and got our face painted.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_25-05-TheVyne.jpg</src><caption>Butterflies at The Vyne</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_25-33-TheVyne.jpg</src><caption>2 Rabbits, 1 chicken</caption></image>

    <title>Royal Wedding: Kate and William. Thames Kayaking: Staines - Laleham</title>
    <info>
		<p>There was alot of expectation and good will towards the wedding of Kate Middleton and Prince William. We settled down to watch the coverage a little after 8am. Great Grandma came over as well so we could all share it together. Katie was well into the fashion, the dresses and who was who. Ben and Jessica were not interested at all and were climbing all over Mummy, Daddy and the furniture. Not the most relaxing of atmospheres to enjoy the occassion.</p><p>Still it all went very well and it put a smile on our faces. We did think for a bit whether we should have gone up to London, but thought better of it, and glad we decided to stay at home.</p><p>The wedding finished a little after midday, and our neighbours behind us had kindly organised a mini street party. Bring your own meat and you can stick it on their BBQ's.</p><p>It was good to see many people you only said hi to in the mornings. A successful event.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_29-01-KateWilliamStreetParty.jpg</src><caption>Swordsmans Road Street Party</caption></image><p>Katie and Ben made a couple of friends. The boys who live behind us. Katie was rather smitten by one of the boys, and has since longed for him to come and play. Again since then, she's being putting on make up and turning into a teenager! Daddy does not like this! Is this what the next 15 years are going to be about? When Muumy returned to the house at 6pm, there were 7 children in the house all playing. There was a lot of tidying up to be done.</p><p>Whilst Mummy was enjoying the Lebanonese Rose Wine, Daddy went out with his friend Micheal to go Kayaking for the next leg down the Thames. This was going to be the first time with two adults paddling. Were we going to turbo? Well no. In fact they both got back aches sitting at the front, until they finally moved the back rest forwards. Other than that they enjoyed paddling from just east on Penton Lock up to the Sprayground in Staines and back again.</p><p>On the way back they had to operate the locks themselves, which was quite ammusing to see them try and work it out. A good two or three hour trip.</p>

    <title>Horse Riding, Surrey Heath Show</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Katie went horse riding. This week she was back in the sand pit and looked very competent going around the arena and doing a narrow path maneuver.</p><p>After her lesson we rushed home for a spot of lunch before heading out again to the Surrey Heath show. Mummy had a 2 hour stint on the playgroup stall selling toys. We brought Grandma down with us and sat and enjoyed the sunshine.</p><p>We had a nice time and went on some of the fair rides, decorated some cakes, and played the golf game and trap the rat.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_30-01-SandPitSurreyHeathShow.jpg</src><caption>Katie showing off her horse riding skills</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_30-14-SandPitSurreyHeathShow.jpg</src><caption>Jessica loves the fairground rides</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_04_30-25-SandPitSurreyHeathShow.jpg</src><caption>Jessica WWII Jeep Driver</caption></image>

		<p>Daddy embarked on cooking a Sunday lunch for us and the Fars. He tried the Beef Roast pot, with a lemon surprise pudding. It went ok.</p><p>Later in the afternoon finally Katie's new 'friend' came over to play, a relief for us all, as all she has been going on about is for Michael to come and play. They played nicely for 4 hours. A very nice boy.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_01-01-SundayLunch.jpg</src><caption>Beefy Meal</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 15: The Ridgeway Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>Another walk from the book this time over in Oxfordshire. We were planning on doing this one a few weeks back, but dead bodies were found in a farmers field so we didn't fancy it then.</p><p>We trekked over to the Ridgeway, a national trail lasting over 80 miles. We tackled just 5 miles (2.5 miles each way). We were retracing steps relating to George and the Dragon. We parked on top of a hill in the middle of no where and headed east along The Ridgeway. It was nice easy path for the pushchair and the weather was glorious if a little windy.</p><p>First landmark was Wayland's Smithy, a burial site from 3000 years ago. There were a couple of small rooms that we could play in. We didn't grasp the historical significance of what 3000 years ago meant really. Anyway we continued eastwards and climbed the path and hit Uffington Castle. Laura was most disapointed that there was nothing to show for the castle other than a ditch surrounding the site. Still the views were amazing on this clear day. It was exceptionally windy up there and we loved running down and climbing up the banks of the ditches. We stopped here for our picnic.</p><p>We continued steeply down the hill towards Dragon Hill and past what we think was the White Horse. It wasn't much of one. There were some wierd pagen type people performing some ritual on top of Dragon Hill. They left quickly and again we had nice views of the surrounding area. The kiddies loved it as they could climb, run off, roll, whatever. We had reached the halfway point. The only disapointing thing about this walk was the fact we had to retrace our steps back to the car. We prefer circular walks where we can see different scenary. Anyway Katie and Daddy took a slightly differnt route back and beat the rest of us back to the otherside of the castle.</p><p>We also found a secret, wooded pathway which ran parallel to the main track which made the return journey a little more interesting. We wanted to go back into Wayland's Smithy again, this time we played a few games of 'forty forty'. We had a great time.</p><p>We eventually got back to the car and drove home exhausted. Another good walk.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_02-03-TheRidgewayWalk.jpg</src><caption>The Gay's</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_02-34-TheRidgewayWalk.jpg</src><caption>Dragon Hill</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_02-56-TheRidgewayWalk.jpg</src><caption>Ben lost in a rapeseed field</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_02-77-TheRidgewayWalk.jpg</src><caption>Tree Climbers</caption></image>

    <title>Skate Jam, Charlotte's Birthday BBQ</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had some vouchers for Skate Jam at Tomslinscote so we went there for the first time in a long while. Whilst Katie and Ben rollerskated, Jessica played in the new toddler area. She's got a wicked laugh.</p><p>Charolotte turned 25 today and as such invited the Weston's, Elder's, Steve Barnett and family, and the Greathead's to a BBQ at her house in Cheltenham. We got there for 1 o'clock and there was plenty of lovely food. It's the first time we saw the Greathead's. Old friends of Ma Ma and Pop Pop.</p><p>Later in the afternoon we got the sprinkler out, stripped off and ran up and down the garden getting completely soaked. It's amazing how such a simple, cheap thing provides so much fun.</p><p>Us kids had a whale of a time playing on Luke's wheelchairs. We were wheeling about all over the house and garden.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_07-22-Charlottes25thBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Sprinkles</caption></image>

    <title>Birthday Party and Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy worked in the morning, whilst we went off to church where we also had church parade.</p><p>In the afternoon Jessica and mummy went to Mia's birthday party which was brilliant. Lots of games and a BBQ.</p><p>Meanwhile the rest of us went over to Watchet's park, layed tennis for a bit, then made up a game in the playground. It was 'crocodiles' where if we were on an aparatus we were safe, otherwise Daddy would dump us outside the play area for about 5 minutes. It got interesting later on when Daddy fired a football at us. Fortunately he was such a bad shot he never hit us! Daddy did have a bit of a hypo which slowed him down a bit. We had a great time.</p>

		<p>The Elders stayed the night and Uncle Michael came over in the morning to pick us up. Before they returned to Alton we first went to the Heatherside to the new swing park and had a great time on the swing. After was the annual fete and maypole skip! Ben did not disapoint. He still reckoned he could skip easy. Ermm. Well he can't!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_14-01-Maypole.jpg</src><caption>Maypole Skip</caption></image><p>After the skipping Katie went to Frimley Lodge Park for a Brownie day. She was amongst all other Brownies in the Surrey Heath area. Meanwhile Mummy, Ben and Jessica ran the teddy tombola at the fete after the maypole. It was a great success, if a little manic.</p><p>Daddy went off with Farfar to Wembley for the FA Cup final. This year they were supporting the underdogs, Stoke City against Manchester City. There was a corking atmosphere, much noisier than last year. Not sure if this is because we turned up a little later, or becaues it was teams who hadn't been to the FA Cup final for 30 years or so.</p><p>We had seats in the corner in the Stoke end. The game wasn't up too much really, but enjoyed it more than last year. The game ended with a 1-0 victory to Man City.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_14-09-FACupFinal.jpg</src><caption>Wembley - FA Cup Final</caption></image><p>In the evening Leah came for a sleepover. We barely see her nowadays since she has moved schools. Fortunately they went to bed the right side of midnight!</p>

		<p>We headed for the curch fair, mid morning. We were running the tombola and as a group managed to raise over a thousand pounds. The main objective for us children was to spend our modest allocated money. Jessica spent it on some second hand toys. Ben bought himself, Daddy and Farfar steam train books, whilst Katie bought both Mummy and Daddy a present ready for their birthday's. We've got lovely generous children.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_21-02-ChurchFair.jpg</src><caption>Jessica face painted and roaring to go</caption></image><p>In the afternoon we went off to Uncle Peter's who was hosting a BBQ as a substitute to Peter and Norma's cancelled wedding aniversary party. Todd and Olly made it over and joined the Weston's, Matt's family, the Elders, Jude and Charlotte. We had a great time. Ben made ice cream from his new ice cream maker. We also all played football in the field behind Peter's house. A mention to Joey who was an expert at Hula Hooping!</p>

    <title>Walk 16: Alice In Wonderland Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy worked in the morning and the rest of us went off to church. We helped ring the bells which was good fun. Mummy was on sidesmans duty.</p><p>After Sunday lunch we went off to the other side of Oxford to a little place called Wolvercote which was on the Thames. This was the Alice In Wonderland walk as some of the story was based on the setting here.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_22-37-WolvercoteWalk.jpg</src><caption>Walkers</caption></image><p>We started the 3.5 mile walk and headed south along the east side of the river. It was open meadow land. Katie and Ben were playing 'reindeers'. We saw a number of geese and duck families with their very young. A mile and a half down the river we crossed a bridge where we saw some teenage girls jumping into the cold river. They were mad.</p><p>Our return leg saw Daddy get a bit of a hypo. This time he felt pins and needles all over both legs. Still he was alright to make a fool of himself on an old, dead tree trunk which went in to the river. We wished for him to lose his balance and fall... well all except from Katie who of course was very concerned. Alas he managed to keep his balance.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_22-77-WolvercoteWalk.jpg</src><caption>We all begging that he'd fall in</caption></image><p>We finally made it back to the car, and made our return journey home.</p>

    <title>Rugby Premiership Final</title>
    <info>
		<p>Last night we had Natasha Kelly stay over for a sleepover.</p><p>In the morning we had to drop the motorbike off for its MOT, this was followed by Mummy helping out at Cross Farm School and the rest of us going to Farfars to play with his new train set.</p><p>Daddy managed to get some free tickets for the Rugby Premiership final at Twickenham. So Daddy and Ben trooped off and parked up in Whitton and walked with the rest of the crowds to the stadium. I don't know what Ben was expecting. He'd been to Reading 18 months ago, but he was alot older and could appreciate the event a little more, plus there were over 80,000 people in attendance.</p><p>We arrived and there were tents with freebies and rugby related activities. We even managed to get on the TV in the background whilst Martin Johnson was being interviewed on ESPN.</p><p>We showed our tickets and headed for a pitchside photo. Ben was getting quite excited to see how big the stadium was on the inside.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_28-06-RugbyPremiershipFinal.jpg</src><caption>Twickers</caption></image><p>We then climbed to the top of the North Stand up by the roof and looked over Twickenham. We loved the views.</p><p>To the game, we sat next to Daddy's boss and his wife who were rugby fans. They were rooting for Leicester Tigers, we went for Saracens. Ben was getting into it, especially the scoring. He cottoned onto the points awarded for tries, conversions and penalties. He got off his seat and cheered when Saracens did well, and we put the thumbs down when they did not.</p><p>The game ended on a fantastic ruck and maul climax. Saracens fotunately held out and won the game. We left soon after the final whistle and marched back to the car. Ben was asking loads of questions and commenting on the game. He loved it and even at one point said he prefered rugby to football!</p><p>All the girls stayed at home, Katie deciding that she wanted to swap bedrooms with Jessica. So now Katie sleeps on her own in the front bedroom, leaving Ben on the top bunk and Jessica on the bottom bunk in the back bedroom.</p><p>In the evening Daddy rushed off to Reading to watch a disappointing Champions League final with Steve and Phil.</p>

    <title>PGA European Golf Championships, Ben over to Ma Ma and Pop Pops</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy went with Farfar to the golf over at Wentworth. Now all the top players seem to be European, it was good to see what felt like a top golf event.</p><p>They decided to try a different set of holes this year, well to start with anyway. They walked the driving range, the first tee where they saw the likes of Colin Montgomerie tee off, and followed some of the midfield up to the 3rd hole.</p><p>The scoring was not fantastic, probably due to the gusty conditions. Rory McIlroy had a big following, the Fisher - Yang partnership were so slow. We couldn't understand why so much time had to be taken between shots, we were both getting a bit impatient.</p><p>We decided to follow the Dane Anders Anderson who wasn't playing particularly well. He partnered a Scotsman called Whiteford. We were amazed to see him smoking as he walked down the fairway. Cheeky. On our way round we were stopped by someone who Farfar knew from football of course. He's been coming to watch for years for free by walking over some woods onto the course. Music to Daddy's ears. We'll have to try that one in a future year.</p><p>They ended on the popular 14th hole, seeing Anders par another hole. Both getting a bit tired (poor them), they decided to head back home. A nice day at the golf finalizing a good few weeks of top sport for Daddy.</p><p>In the evening Auntie Ellie took Joey and Ben over to Ma Ma and Pop Pops for a sleepover. Ben insisted on watching the rugby highlights from the day before and was reported to be a bit of a know it all at a quiz that they played! Is he turning into a bit of a big head? He stayed the night.</p><p>Account from Auntie Ellie:</p><p>I met Auntie Ellie at the Farnham roundabout and travelled to Ma Ma's in her car with Joey. We listened to Horrid Henry all the way as Auntie Ellie does not like to talk when on the motorway! When we got to Ma Ma and Pop Pops it was about 7 so we played some games with Ma Ma and watched a bit of Garfield but I didn't like it. At about 8, Auntie Ellie supposedly went home so we all said our goodbyes. Just before bed, Ma Ma read some Where's Wally with us - big mistake: when Pop Pops lifted Joey in the night for a wee poor Joey got upset and said he was having nightmares about Wheres Wally. Ma Ma did some of her special Ma Ma magic and managed to make Auntie Ellie appear from upstairs. Joey was very happy and snuggled up with his Mummy. The next day it was decided Auntie Ellie could join Joey and Me on our boys trip to the Grandparents.</p>

    <title>Walk 17: George Bernard Shaw - Ayot. St Lawerence, Ben to Rainham Marshes</title>
    <info>
		<p>Our first walk as only a four as Ben was enjoying himself over at Ma Ma and Pop Pop's. We went up to Hertfordshire for a countryside walk in a small village called Ayot St. Lawerence.</p><p>There was a beautiful pub and even more beautiful poppy field as our opening 100 metres.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_30-01-AyotStLawerence.jpg</src><caption>Poppy field</caption></image><p>We stopped off to have a picnic overseeing some lovely Hertfordshire countryside. We played by the stream halfway through our walk.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_30-09a-AyotStLawerence.jpg</src><caption>Poppy field</caption></image><p>We had to cross a field soon after which had a horse in it. The crew got predictably nervous. Daddy's advice was to stick together, not to run or shout else it might startle the horse. Daddy and Katie headed calmly towards to horse in a straight line. Mummy for some reason headed in an arc direction sort of away from the horse at a fast, nervous pace which quickened when the horse set it's eyes on them and started to walk towards them. Laura then ran, which made the horse run, which inturn made Jessica scream. Real panic set in. The horse slowed to a walk as it got closer to Mummy and Jessica. Daddy and Katie who were behind just calmly walked past the horse to the otherside of the field. The horse did give some heavy snorts as if he was not pleased that we crossed his field.</p><p>At the other end of the field there was a stream with a bridge, so we played Pooh sticks. I think we must play Pooh sticks more than anyone else as it is a game we play everytime we cross a stream! Mummy spotted some watercress growing in the middle of the stream and remarked how that was on this weeks shopping list. Daddy smelt a potential saving of some money so rolled up his trouser legs and waded in and picked a healthy bunch!</p><p>Nearing the end of our walk we saw the new church.....</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_30-30-AyotStLawerence.jpg</src><caption>Poppy field</caption></image><p>.. and the old church!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_05_30-32-AyotStLawerence.jpg</src><caption>Poppy field</caption></image><p>Account from Auntie Ellie:</p><p>First stop of the day was to Toys r Us as Ma Ma said we could pick a toy. We scoured the whole Toys R Us - amazing fun - we could have stayed all day. Finally we both decided on some Star Wars Lego. We popped into Asda to get a picnic then set off to Rainham Marshes for the day. We had great fun. Naturally first thing we did was have a coffee and a muffin - just juice for Joey and I. Then we went into the marshes which according to Mummy is 'totally free and you won't spend a penny', however cost Pop Pop £12.50. Joey and I played for ages in the adventure playground with our lego men. After our picnic I very very very relunctantly with a  big scowl on my face went pond dipping. It was actually quite fun in the end and we caught lots of tiny fishes and weird bugs.</p><p>At about 4 we headed home to play in the garden. Pop Pops and Auntie Ellie went for a bike ride but we just wanted to play. We had yummy burgers for tea and then went to bed. We had a lovely time and so did Auntie Ellie.</p>

    <title>Meet with the Burrows, Stay at Ma Ma and Pop Pops</title>
    <info>
		<p>During this half term week we had booked ourselves up to the max. Today we went over to Swanley Park on this boiling hot day and met up with Fi, Thomas and Natasha. We had a great time playing the water park bit. Ben managed to scrape his nose, so had a big scab there for a week! Ben had a go on the go-karts, Jessica on the bouncey castle, and Katie had a huge, double 99 ice cream!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_01-02-SwanleyPark.jpg</src><caption>Thomas and Ben</caption></image><p>We stayed at Ma Ma and Pop Pop's for the next 2 nights.</p>

    <title>Elder Sleep Over - New Forest Bike Ride</title>
    <info>
		<p>Last night Summer came over to stay the night. Katie and Ben played so well with Summer. Out of all her friends, Summer has a great imagination and brings out the best in the kiddies, pretend this and pretend that. Fantastico.</p><p>In the morning Daddy left early for a bike ride with the Weston's / Elder's crew. There were 8 of them in total partaking in a two day cycling bonanza! There was to be some serious, hard riding.</p><p>They reached Stockley car park, pumped up our tyres ready for the off, Daddy waiting like a coiled spring, but Uncle Peter had a problem. The valve had snapped on his wheel! After a replacement inner tube they headed west along the road to Brokenhurst.</p><p>They stopped periodically so they all bunched up again and took on refreshments. Uncle Peter went one step further and retrieve a can of beer from his water bottle holder! Uncle Michael would then spend half an hour tippy tapping on his computer to find out they need to turn left at the next junction.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_04-10-NewForestBikeRideBucklersHard.jpg</src><caption>Pete takes on performance enhancing fluids</caption></image><p>To brighten everyones day, Daddy played some nice little innocent tricks, by rubbing his tyres against Uncle Michael's. How they all laughed and Uncle Michael took it in good humour. Well that's what Daddy thought. Five minutes later, naughty Uncle Michael soaked Daddy with his water bottle, then later in the middle of a busy Lymington quayside, pulled Daddy's shorts down. Some uncles take things too far! Auntie Ellie reckons Daddy had lots of holes in his pants and vows to get him some for his birthday! Still it's better than a pebble dashed shower curtain.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_04-08-NewForestBikeRideBucklersHard.jpg</src><caption>What a load of pony, riding up another hill</caption></image><p>At the quaint town of Lymington they also stopped for a small bite to eat and bask in the sunshine. Uncle Peter had a sleep. They continued east, past a 'Costa' which almost gave Pop Pop the shakes, and into the wilderness. It was nice to ride along roads which did not have much traffic on.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_04-47-NewForestBikeRideBucklersHard.jpg</src><caption>Sitting down at Lymington before someone pulls my shorts down</caption></image><p>They headed to Bucklers Hard. With five miles to go, both Daddy and Auntie Ellie decided to try and complete this in the quickest time they could. Auntie Ellie was in training for a triathlon in a months time. Anyway it was tiring, but Daddy completed it in a touch over 20 minutes. Ellie did well and peddled in a couple of minute later. They were exhausted but found the energy to find the pub. The Yauchstman overlooked a tributary to the Solent. It was beautiful with old, red brick, worker cottages lining the grass driveway. Everyone piled in behind and took a BBQ lunch, except for Daddy who made his own sandwiches!</p><p>Time was pressing, so reluctantly they decided to part ways with Bucklers Hard and shift north along the country roads. For the last mile of the journey back to the carpark, Daddy and Uncle Michael raced. It was a close run affair.</p><p>Still mid afternoon, some of us wanted to continue cycling and some were quite happy to flake out and recover on a blanket in the wilderness. Uncle Michael found a couple of Geo-Caches that they could find, so headed off road into the woods. They eventually navigated our way to the first geo-cache in a spooky wood, Auntie Ellie signed her name in the book, then moved off towards Hatchet Pond where they stopped off for an ice cream. They were quite expensive, some costing £10! Unfortunately another chap was also geo-caching so gave the second spot away a bit. Still as they say in the geo-caching game; 'a geo-cache is a geo-cache. Doesn't matter how you get them'. Well that's what I imagine them saying.</p><p>They returned back to the van, went to the hotel where they freshened up, watched England perform abismally against Switzerland and then had the saga of getting to a pub for the evening's entertainments and food. Some bright spark thought that if the youngsters cycle it would mean one less car driver on the road. They picked a pub just a few miles away only to find it was shut for renovation! They asked a local for the next nearest pub, but was unable to find an interpreter to convert the New Forest accent to Estuary English! Michael tippy tapped again and the computer said the New Forest Inn, Emery Down. They ordered food, decided that Uncle Howard wasn't keen on pear cider, Martin got an insight to his Asian friend and Uncle Peter was defending the vegetarian sausage!</p><p>Hometime, and it was pitch black which was a bit of a problem when you don't have lights for your bike and you are travelling down country lanes! Fortunately Uncle Michael tippy tapped again and managed to get the light on his computer to work. Hooray. Auntie Ellie described that 3 mile journey as scarey. Daddy slept in with the Elders.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_04-49-NewForestBikeRideBucklersHard.jpg</src><caption>Knight Rider</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_04-01-NewForestBikeRideBucklersHard.jpg</src><caption>Today's route</caption></image>

    <title>Joshua's Christening, New Forest Bike Ride - Burley Circular</title>
    <info>
		<p>They were all awoken early on Sunday morning by a load of French tourists. They were not best pleased. Martin Cherry also had to contend with the wildlife noises in his room known as Uncle Peter and Pop Pop. Daddy and Auntie Ellie were not going to get back to sleep again so Daddy suggested that they should go for a run, not thinking that Ellie would reply positively. Anyway the 5km jog saw them go back into Minstead and return up all the hills. It nearly killed poor Daddy.</p><p>They met up and went into the adjoining Little Chef for breakfast. They were all surprised at the menu changes. Less cooked breakfasts, more options. Daddy had tea cakes! They then set off towards Burley for the start point of our off road adventure. The weather was just about holding out, a lot cooler and there were a few spots in the air, not enough to put us off though. Susan, the only sensible one, decided to stay in Burley and have a mooch about.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_05-03-NewForestBikeRideBurley.jpg</src><caption>Uncle Michael's wheely good</caption></image><p>They headed north into the woods of the New Forest. Daddy loved going down the hills super fast and pulling skids so everyone else had to go through the dust created! Uncle Howard was getting rather tired of all the up hills. They eventually ended up at the top of a big hill at Bolderwood. They passed some really scenic woodland and the ride down Ornamental drive was fantastic. They stopped off to see a youngling New Forest pony sprint around in circles, no other horses seemed to batter an eyelid and join in.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_05-20-NewForestBikeRideBurley.jpg</src><caption>The biking crew</caption></image><p>They cruised back into Burley, stopped off at the pub in the middle of the village for a spot of lunch before parting our ways and returning home. Everyone enjoyed themselves, some foolish enough to suggest they should do it again next year.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_05-00-NewForestBikeRideBurley.jpg</src><caption>Today's route</caption></image><p>Thanks to everyone for a great weekend, especially Pop Pop for driving and the Elders for organising the route and letting me stay in their room.</p><p>Whilst Daddy was off cruising about, we awoke to a mad house, with Ma Ma, Joey and Lily in attendance. They returned back home in the morning, whilst us lot went to Joshua's christening. Mummy is Godmother to cutie Joshua. We were back in the same church as Evie's christening on Elvetham Heath. At the reception afterwards we played nicely with Evie.</p>

    <title>Over to the Dixons</title>
    <info>
		<p>Early in the morning Daddy and Ben made a rock CD. Songs chosen, by the free minded Ben, with a little encouragement from Daddy. On went Queen, Kaiser Chiefs, White Stripes and his now favourite The Prodigy, Omen.</p><p>We headed upto Herfordshire to visit the Dixons for the first time at their new abode. We arrived a bit too early, but before you could say hello, Yasmin, Ben and Katie were hand in hand skipping down the road. No getting used to each other, they were straight in there. It was lovely to see.</p><p>On the way over we were trying to work out how the Dixons were related to us, simply put our Great Grandfather and Yasmin's and Reuben's Great Grandmother were brother and sister. Pretty distant in one respect, but they are one of the closest relative's we have on Daddy's side of the family.</p><p>We needn't have worried about the weather, it was nice and sunny which allowed us to go in the long back garden which was great for the kiddies. There were plenty of things to play with. David stoked up the BBQ and we had a nice cup of tea. It was treat time as David had been down the butchers to select our feast!!</p><p>The children played very nicely with one another. The dressing up box got raided, thankfully Ben stayed away from this, he favoured playing with the train track. We were treated to some dancing from our Pop Princess'.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_11-04-DixonsApsley.jpg</src><caption>Pop Princess'</caption></image><p>We headed out to the 70's playground just over the railway bridge and of course played crocodiles, a game introduced to younf Yasmin. After the adults all ate us we went 'Super High' on the swings and happily pushed people down the big mound. The weather closed in so we quickly scootered back for another cuppa before setting our sights on home.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_11-15-DixonsApsley.jpg</src><caption>Slide Away</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_11-17-DixonsApsley.jpg</src><caption>Reuben flying high</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_11-20-DixonsApsley.jpg</src><caption>Reuben flying high</caption></image><p>A lovely day out with the Dixons had by all. The return leg to be held later in the summer.</p>

    <title>Daddy At School Day</title>
    <info>
		<p>Two bookings for Daddy today. First Daddy took us to school in a big round trip which started and ended at playschool. A 3 hour session at Frimley Green Pre School was first up. No other dad's in, and not many in during the whole of 'Fathers Week'. Still Jessica was very pleased to have a shadow. First up was some drawing and colouring. Very soon we had attracted a whole table of drawerers all very eager to show off their talents to Daddy. Daddy ended up going around helping all the children on the table and telling them what to draw.</p><p>Jessica had a very good friend in Ammie Huggarts, well thats what Jessica calls her. She is quiet, but very nice. She joined us on all our travels around the differnt activities. We played inside and out, we counted on the abacus, played on the computer, spun the hula hoop, played with the blocks. There was story time, snack time and excercise time. Jessica is certainly a little timid, being one of the younger ones, well behaved and such a cutie. She makes Daddy laugh constantly and he is very proud of her.</p><p>Daddy quickly dropped Jessica off to Mummy who had a lovely morning off, before returning back into Frimley Green for an afternoon of Cross Farm. This was far better attended by the Dads. Ben was in Miss Sollers class, who was quite strict with the children.... and she was fairly young. There was a lot of sitting on the mat and listening and answering question. It was first about recycling which involved some art work. Daddy and Ben had to fill in the recycle symbol with various materials that can be recycled: fabric, newspaper and foil. It involved gluing and scisor work. Some more mat sessions before it was hometime.</p><p>A lovely day for Daddy to spend some time with the children in their schools.</p>

    <title>Surrey Youth Games</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie was selected to play for Surrey Heath's B Team in the Surrey Youth Games at Surrey University. Fantastic. She has been having lessons at the local tennis club and was selected to play.</p><p>We arrived at the university sports campus at 9am and headed straight for the tennis courts. There were a dozen or so boroughs been represented in sports from Netball, Football, Badminton, Hockey, Squash, Tennis and even Boxing.</p><p>Katie played a couple of doubles matches and a couple of singles. Unfortunately the scoring didn't quite go her way, however, she really enjoyed playing and it was good to see her part of a team. She wants to continue with more tennis lessons and will drop the horse riding for it.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_18-40-SurreyYouthGames.jpg</src><caption>Katie smashes a two handed back and forehanded shot down the line.</caption></image>

    <title>Fathers' Day - Kayaking</title>
    <info>
		<p>We woke early and gave Daddy his presents in bed. Katie help build a bird box, Ben gave a screwdriver set because apparently Daddy has to do a lot of DIY, and Jessica got Daddy a fruit compote which he really likes. Daddy also got 5 cards in total, made from school and Sunday school.</p><p>Daddy then went off to give Farfar his Fathers' day treat, which was a day on the Kayak doing a circular tour along the Abbey River in Chertsey, upto Penton Lock and back down the Thames to Chertsey Bridge. Abbey River was quite overgrown in places with reeds and lily pads. At one point a tree trunk had fallen across the river and both Daddy and Farfar were balanced on the trunk lifting the kayak over. Daddy lost his balance and fell in! Soaked up to the waist.</p><p>Anyway they stopped a couple of times and met up with Farmor for some food. I think Farfar sort of enjoyed it even though it was not the most comfortable ride he's ever had.</p><p>Later in the afternoon Ma Ma and Pop Pop came over for some tea and cake.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_19-07-FathersDayKayak.jpg</src><caption>Abbey River</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_19-20-FathersDayKayak.jpg</src><caption>Waiting at Chertsey Lock</caption></image>

    <title>Mummy's 35th Birthday - School Fete - Army Show - BBQ</title>
    <info>
		<p>We awoke early with Daddy helping Katie put banners she made all around the house. The banners were a mixture of 'Your 35 today' to song lyrics she made up. It was a very sweet gesture.</p><p>Anyway we all landed in Mummy and Daddy's bed helping Mummy open her cards and presents. Her favuorite was the sequel to the walks book around London that we have. This time the Walks book were all in London; good choice Jessica.</p><p>Katie gave a big hot chocolate mug and spoon that she picked up at the church fair, whilst Ben got Mummy a big Galaxy bar, which I think he got just so Mummy could share it with him. Daddy got her a pair of nice Jeans and some brown casual trousers. Other presents included a notepad set from Ma Ma and Pop Pop, a black dress from Charlotte, some shoes from Ellie, a vase from Fi, some smellies from the Fars and Susan.</p><p>Farmor popped in and gave her present. After a trip to the supermarket we briefly went to the excellent Cross Farm Fete where we went on the bouncey castle, the teddy tombola, the pick a bag of sweet stall, beat the goalie and Katie and Jessica got there hair sprayed pink and black! We caught up with Ma Ma and Pop Pop for a bit there as well.</p><p>After lunch our guests arrived: The Elders, Auntie Charlotte, The Burrows and Fi's sister and husband, Jo and Bert. Auntie Susan popped in for a bit to drop off a present for the birthday girl.</p><p>We went over to the army show which is one of our favourite shows of the year, right slap bang on our door step. All the usuals were there. Ben was well into his guns.</p><p>We returned for some BBQ action and finished up with a water fight on the field opposite. A great day with our friends</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_25-00-Lau35thBirthday-ArmyShow.jpg</src><caption>The guys</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_06_25-76-Lau35thBirthday-ArmyShow.jpg</src><caption>The guys</caption></image>

    <title>Thames Kayaking, Elders over</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy, Ben and Jessica went off to church leaving Daddy and Katie going on the next leg down the Thames. Farfar kindly gave us a lift to Chertsey bridge and pushed us off and waved us goodbye. It was the hottest day of the year, a scorcher. We headed east up past Shepperton to Walton. Katie had a good few go's at paddling along... and well we saw some nature close up. To be fair Katie paddled the final 250 metres no problem. Tempted to get paddles that befit her size.</p><p>We ended at the Anglers pub where Katie had a screwball from the ice cream van. We went home where Daddy, Uncle Michael, and Daddy's other friend Michael were all supposed to go karting. There was a cock up in the bookings which meant they ddin't go in the end. Instead they all came back to the house for some more mayhem in the back garden. We had the paddling pool out and there was plenty of water being chucked about. Pop Pop popped in for 10 minutes as well.</p>

    <title>Walk 18: Greenwich</title>
    <info>
		<p>A bright, sunny day and we headed off early up to Greenwich for the next installment of the Gay's walking bonanza. Today's guest appearance was Pop Pop. Daddy parked the car in Blackheath and joined us by the Cutt Sark. Well I'd call it a boarded up town. Everywhere it seemed was preparing for the olympic games.</p><p>Our shortish walk took in the Painted Hall, the college chapel, the statue of Nelson at the Trafalgar public house, the swings in the park, the Queen's house, the maritime museum where we saw the bullet hole in Nelson's outfit, the observatory, 0 degrees longitude, the deer park, Greenwich market and the tunnel under to Island Gardens.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_07_02-17-Greenwich.jpg</src><caption>Maritime College</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_07_02-43-Greenwich.jpg</src><caption>Greenwich Tunnel</caption></image><p>We certainly packed a lot in and were exhausted by the time we got home. Daddy then went over to Reading to watch the Haye v Klitschco fight. A late night!</p>

    <title>Fars Danish Buffet</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy worked in the morning in his new office, aka Katie's bedroom, whilst the rest of us went to church.</p><p>At lunchtime we went over to the Fars for the now annual Danish Buffet. Ben had worked out that if we had children, that a half of a quatre was an eigth! He also said he wasn't going to have breakfast so he could leave more room for frikidellar!</p><p>Auntie Susan and Graham came as well as Uncle Ron who we have not seen for five years perhaps. So it was good to see him. He was in good spirits and it was nice to see him comfortable in the surroundings. Ah, the surroundings grew ever more boisterous after we drew and outline of ourselves and painted. Aimee and Emma, George and Georgia came over to play, so 7 kiddies in all. It became somehow a little manic. We seem to attract 'manicness'.</p><p>We of course had an excellent lunch all of Danish related foods, well perhaps except the sausages. We had a egg cake, fish cake, herrings, frikidellar, pickled cucumber, danish salami, the lot. We were all stuffed.</p><p>We played lots of games, first up football with Graham and Daddy. It was great first passing and then Katie and Ben trying to get the ball of Graham and Daddy. Farfar had made a 'Where's Wally' game, where we had to find the characters in the back garden, amongst the phonies and folliage! Later Mummy made loads of games for us to play.</p><p>A good time had by all, luckily the weather was good.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_07_03-14-FarsDanishBuffet.jpg</src><caption>Prizes for the Where's Wally handed out</caption></image>

    <title>Jessica Hospital Check Up</title>
    <info>
		<p>On a couple of occassions Jessica has gone into a fit where she's gone unconcious for a period of a minute or two. Today we finally found that there is nothing to worry about, this can happen to children and she will probably grow out of it. Anyway she was such a star. She had an ECG stuck onto her. She took it all in her stride. Good girl Jessica.</p>

    <title>Walk 19: Dick Whittington Walk, Elders for dinner</title>
    <info>
		<p>We picked Katie from a sleep over at Natasha Kelley's house. She had stayed up past midnight and got up early to play the Wii. Today we have a long walk planned so looking forward to Katie's mood later on!</p><p>We drove to South Wimbledon tube and got the Northern line up to Bank where we Mummy decided we would try and do the walk backwards! It didn't work too well, so we started at Canon Street station and took in the sites of the church where Dick Whittington is buried, the Guildhall, Mansion House, the Bank Of England, the Royal Exchange, Ledenhall Market, the Gurkin, the Lloyds building and Tower 42. There were some quaint, narrow olde worldy type streets which we enjoyed discovering. There is just so much to London that we never see. Mummy and Daddy enjoyed it, us children were just going along. At Bank we stopped for a bit to marval at the buildings. There happened to be a piano there which we played and entertained people with. Quite quirky really.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_07_09-02-DickWhittington.jpg</src><caption>Inside Out</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_07_09-28-DickWhittington.jpg</src><caption>Bank</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_07_09-29-DickWhittington.jpg</src><caption>Leadenhall Market</caption></image><p>Going from one of the richest and nicest parts of London to other end of the spectrum and Hoxton, where the Gay family lived 150 years ago. Daddy really wanted to go to a pie and mash shop. Well it wasn't for the tourists that is for sure, the lady running the place was proper east end, the cafe had sawdust all over the floor, the tables had salt all over them, we think just because they hadn't been cleaned. There were quite a few locals and they all seemed authentic east london. Only Daddy, Ben and Mummy were brave enough to sample the pie and mash. The mash scraped onto the edge of the plate, the pie nothing special. A bit disapointing really.</p><p>After leaving we got Jess and Katie their lunch and walked up Hoxton high street which had a low-end market running. We headed east towards Victoria Park, another haunt Daddy wanted to visit, just because again alot of old addresses were from that area. Walking there we saw a lot of boarded up flats. Seemed quite a poor area. An old black gentleman sitting on a bench high fived us all as we walked passed. The children were not scared, which we expected. Members of our party were begining to flag. We walked up Broadway Market which was a pocket of class in an otherwise impoverished area. A recommendation to the Fars for this place. We went slighlty out of our way as we hit London Fields. Patience was running thin. We eventually made it to Victora Park only to find the playground was shut for maintenance!</p><p>Ben decided he needed another wee didn't hide to well when tiddling up a tree. That boy! We continued walking to Bethnal Green tube where there was the biggest police presense we've ever seen. There must have been 20+ police vans and seemingly 100's of officers all surrounding the pub. Apparently they were there to prevent some gang fight. A lot of poilce!</p><p>A welcome relief to be off our feet we returned on the tube back to South Wimbledon. Mummy and Ben stopped at Stockwell as Benny needed the toilet again!</p><p>The Elders came around later in the evening for some din dins with us.</p>

    <title>Daddy's 36th Birthday - Frimley Green Carnival</title>
    <info>
		<p>Woo Hoo, Daddy is 36 today! We started in the traditional way by opening presents in mummy and daddy's bed. Daddy got some chocolate, a patio light set, bike lights, crisps, bike pump, bike gloves, a piece of rainbow trout, a belt and Asda vouchers.</p><p>The Fars came around early to give some more presents and stayed for a quick cup of tea. Mummy and the rest of us went down to 'the Green' to help setup the stall for the playschool. Meanwhile Daddy took Katie and Ben off to Frimley Lodge Park where we mainly played on the zipwire. Because it is new it did indeed zip along. Luckily mummy wasn't there as Daddy was fizzing us down, sending us upside down when we hit the end. We loved it.</p><p>We then had the ridiculous wait of 2 hours between the time we got on our floats to the time we actually set off. It is Jessica's first year on a float. She dressed up as a dalmation for the themed 101 Dalmations. Mummy was on the stall and Daddy couldn't really go on with her as he was dressed in the wrong outfit. Still she sat next to Aimee Huggitts, her best friend. She had a mixture of a serious face and a laughing outlook.  We wondered what is going on in that mind of hers when she has a serious face on. I think she was surveying the situation. Something was werring away in that brain of hers. Ben's float was themed with Alice and Wonderland, Ben going as the King of Hearts.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_07_10-09-FrimleyGreenCarnival.jpg</src><caption>Jessica the Dalmation with best friend Aimee</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_07_10-03-FrimleyGreenCarnival.jpg</src><caption>Ben and Oliver</caption></image><p>2pm arrived and we all set off from the playschool and moved slowly down to Frimley Green. Farmor, Ma Ma, Pop Pop, Uncle Peter and the Sanders saw us go past. We threw sweets out to the people watching.</p><p>It took about an hour to reach the finish at Lakeside Country Club. We headed back to the Green to get a much needed ice cream and cup of tea, served by Katie who was working towards her 'Hostess' badge for Brownies.</p><p>Time was marching on so we had to dip out of Steve's BBQ which was a shame. Instead we went home, Daddy cooked a spag boul and a much needed early night.</p>

    <title>School Reports - Sanders BBQ</title>
    <info>
		<p>
        We received the school reports back from both Ben and Katie today. Katie's looks very average on the face of it. All marks are middle of the road. Could do with some improvement on writing, but a very good girl in class and popular.

        </a></p><p>
        Ben's was a good report. We know he excels in maths, but also doing very well at reading. Ben needs to slow down and keeping things neat, but nothing we are worried about. To be honest we couldn't have asked for a better report.

		<p>Ben told us today that they all had to sing a song in assembly. When finished he put his hand up and told the headmistress that he knew a different version, one from church. He was asked if he'd like to sing it, so stood up at the front of the assembly and sang the church version to the school. How sweet.</p>

    <title>Katie's Birthday Party</title>

		<p>School finished today and we organised a Hula Girl party for Katie. She had a dozen or so friends invited around to our house which was a bit manic and Mummy was in charge of party games, Daddy was on BBQ duty. We also had the paddling pool out, the weather just about allowed us this luxury. The wearther has been pretty bad over the past week, so grateful for anything that allows us outside. It was good to see Leah Sumner who we haven't seen much of as well as the Teale's who had to battle through Friday M25 glory!</p><p>Anyway we played the corner game, pass the hot coconut (like pass the bomb), pass the parcel with forefeits, hula girl bingo, limbo, the paddling pool ball game and who stole hula from the hula girl. Mummy dad ever so well controlling lots of excitable girls. The party ended with birthday cake and party bags, which this year included a hula hoop.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_07_22-00-Katies8thBirthdayParty.jpg</src><caption>Invitation</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_07_22-06-Katies8thBirthdayParty.jpg</src><caption>The party go-ers</caption></image>

    <title>Katie's 8th Birthday - Wicksteed Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>We brought the presents into Mummy and Daddy's room and Katie sensibly went through them in a nice manner. She had a great haul. From Mummy and Daddy she got a brand new 20 inch bike, lots of clothing, barbies.</p><p>We didn't hang around too long and ventured to Kettering where we were going to a small theme park and playground area called Wicksteed Park. We parked up at Uncle Philips house who was unfortunately out, but saved us paying £6 car parking fee! It boasted the largest / best playground in Europe. I wouldn't have said that, quite big, but I would say Longleat and Druscilla's had better. After a go on the aforementioned playground, Katie and Mummy went on the pirate ship. Daddy said it looked liked it went very high, Katie came off the ride saying it didn't go high enough! We meandered through the park taking it in turns to have a go on rides. Daddy and Ben went on the dodgems, Jessica on the tug boat ride. We were limited in the number of rides we could go on, and it was a little more restrictive than Pleasure Island in Cleethorpes. i.e. Many rides had to be accompanied by an adult.</p><p>Wicksteed Park has lots of park land. Plenty enough for us to sit down have a picnic overseeing the rest of the park that we hadn't been to yet. We headed over to the umbrella ride. We calculated that we did not have enough to go on the log flume and racing cars. It was getting quite hot, and we all caught the sun abit.</p><p>We headed over to the far end of the park where Daddy had a go on the flying log which is hard to describe and nothing like it at anything park. Basically you are but in a one man toboggan, on rails, raised about 25 feet, then let go, racing down the rails, with a mini ski slope bit at the end meaning you jump in the air and land in a lake of water. Wicked!</p><p>Katie kindly treeted us children to an ice cream each with her own birthday money which was very kind of her. We went on boat ride from 1923, the car ride from the 60's and finally on the train around the park. We were all getting quite tired by now. We had another sneaky go on the playground before walking back the mile long course to the car. Uncle Philip was busy wit a photo shoot, so returned home via some bad M1 traffic and a chip shop. 3.5 hour return journey!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_07_24-30-Katie8thBirthdayWicksteedPark.jpg</src><caption>Our 8 year old</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_07_24-13-Katie8thBirthdayWicksteedPark.jpg</src><caption>Mummy and Jessica ladybirding it up</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_07_24-23-Katie8thBirthdayWicksteedPark.jpg</src><caption>Mummy and Jessica ladybirding it up</caption></image>

She took it all very well, proud she had them, called them tickles rather than itches and even had them in her mough. 'I've got a tickle in my mouth daddy'.  By the end of the week she looked like she had slept on a bed of nails.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_07_27-01-JessicaChickenPox.jpg</src><caption>Jessica's Tickles</caption></image>

    <title>First Week of school hols</title>
    <info>
		<p>During the week we stayed at home a lot. We baby sat Freya and Harrison on Tuesday and Wednesday. We also went on a number of bike rides. Katie is well pleased with her a new bike. Maybe a 'tinsy' bit big. 'Tinsy is Jessica's word of the moment. Ben had also been dressing in girls clothes again and putting on make up!</p><woops woopstitle="Roof bar dumped on M25" rating="4"><p>On the way home from Kent one day, getting on the M25 at Swanley, mummy heard a clunk and something fly off the back of the car. She thought it was the car aerial. It was infact one of the roof bars! How that has not killed someone or caused an accident I don't know.</p></woops>

    <title>Skate Jam, Birthday party, Bike Ride Disaster</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went Skate Jamming down at Tomlinscote School and met up with Nina. In the afternoon Ben went to the Camberley Gym for one of his classmates birthday's. The rest of us went into Camberley to spend Katie's birhtday money on some more Barbies.</p><woops woopstitle="A 10 minute bike ride, so many disasters" rating="7"><p>Daddy had planned to take us out on a bike ride down by the Canal at Frimley Lodge Park, cycle to the Mytchett Centre, go on the swings then return. What possibly could go wrong?</p><p>Enter, Laura Joy Gay, aka Mummy. As we were about to set off Mummy comes running out in her pyjamas saying she wants to come as well. We can't fit her bike onto the car so Daddy said he'd ride her bike down there, whilst Mummy drives down with all the other bikes on the rack. Daddy impressed on Mummy to be really careful because the bikes on the rack only just fit on, and Ben's bike is basically balancing preariously.</p><p>Daddy last 2 yards down the road when he fell off because Mummy had forgot to mention that her handle bars were loose, so that it did not affect the direction you travelled in. It was funny to see Daddy on the fllor. Anyway Daddy managed to tighten up the steering column and off he went. We soon caught up with him on Deepcut road. First speed hump approached, Mummy did not heed Daddy's warnings (apparently she forgot!) and the bikes all jumped in the air, how Ben's did not fall off I do not know! A lucky escape. Daddy couldn not believe his eyes.</p><p>When Daddy trundelled into Frimley Lodge park he saw a pile of bikes on the floor in the middle of the road leading into the car park. Mummy hadn't 'appreciated' the 2 metre height limit and the bike came crashing down! Fortunately there was not much other traffic about and not too many scratches. However, Katie's front wheel wouldn't go around anymore! Daddy re-attached the brakes and we were all good again.</p><p>We started heading towards Mytchett, Jessica was on the baby seat on the back of Daddy's bike and they followed Ben down some mountain bike trails as Ben called them. However, he stopped seemingly for no reason down a cutting leading daddy to stop abruptly, loosing his balance, causing Jessica to fall sideways into a prickle bush. With all those spots on her face anyway you could almost see the comic value of it all. She howled, Daddy unpricked all the prickles from her hands.</p><p>Stress levels also rose when ever we passed a dog off it's lead. Hysterics from Katie and Jessica, as Ben blindly went on up the Canal path, quite close the edge at times! We eventually got to Mytchett only to find the swivel bridge over to the playground had been turned so you couldn't cross. Instead we decided to head back to Frimley Lodge Park and go on their swings. This surprisingly went withough incident.</p><p>It was getting late and because of the rack capacity issue, Mummy was going to cycle home. Katie and Ben both also wanted to cycle back with her. Katie didn't want Ben cycling for some reason so tantrums ensued. Daddy and Jessica drove him and got talking to next door. Un be known to them, Katie's peddle had now fallen off her bike causing her to fall off, tears, the lot. Katie, Ben and Mummy walked to Grandma's and phoned for Daddy to pick them up. Daddy was fixing next door's strimmer at this point. It was going past 8pm now. Eventually Daddy got the call to come and collect us! What a trauma.</p></woops>

    <info>
		<p>Karen and Richard kindly spoilt Katie with a night out down at Pizza Express and a sleepover. Katie stunned everyone by ordering the biggest size pizza they did. No one else knows she is just an eating machine. She even took what she didn't eat home in a doggy bag! Thanks Karen and Richard.</p>

    <title>Evie 2nd Birthday Party, Work Nightmare</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went to church as normal. It was a special service celebrating 100 years of the church. As such both Katie and Ben had short paragraphs to read to the congregation about the history of the curch. They both did very well.</p><woops woopstitle="Work lockout" rating="5"><p>Daddy had to go to work as his machine had locked up. Having to show his security card he forgot to put it back in his wallet. Anyway after an hour or so he went to the toilet taking his wallet so he could get back in, so he thought. Oh dear. He was locked out of his office. Daddy could see his security card and motorbike keys through the window. There was nothing he could do other than jog the 7 miles home. Well jogging the whole way was a bit optimistic with jeans on in this heat. 5 miles down the line he began to feel pins and needles in his head and legs. Anyway thankfully he made it home just in time to go to Evie's birthday party.</p></woops><p>However, mummy thought it was a bit Crookham village hall, sorry guessed it was there. Noone there. Noone at Church Crookham Village hall either, or at the local church. We almost gave up. Fortunately we saw Barrie at the Tesco's borrowed his phone and contacted Rich to find out it was at Crondall!</p><p>The weather was perfect and the village hall was in such a perfect setting. Crondall is lovely in the summer. Situated right next to the village cricket pitch. There were lots of people there include Helen who we haven't seen for a long while. The children were playing by the toilets. Unfortunately they were trying to open the door whilst Ben was sitting on the toilet. Anyway, there were a lot of tears and poo trodden into the floor. Yuk. We were not pleased with Katie fir sticking up for Ben. Anyway, we had to return so that Daddy could lock up his work.</p>

    <title>Ben's 6th Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>We camped in Mummy and Daddy's room for a spot of present opening. He got countless Lego sets, a wallet which he was most pleased about, some Star Wars socks, a huggle buddy, dive sticks, sun glasses, a transformer, Beast Quest books, t-shirts, a watch and a Bin Wevil subscription.. Ben was so sweet inviting Katie and Jessica to open a present eacg for him.</p><p>Fortunately the weather was good and Mummy had arranged a Beast Quest (an adventure book) party for Ben between 11 and 1 o'clock. Auntie Ellie came over to help us play Pass The Bomb, the corner game, </p><p>We had Michael Cox, Joey Harris and his cousin, Oliver, Charlie Borg, Amy Tyas, Joey and Lily . Quite a few, not many he plays with regularly outside of school unfortunately. Mummy had made a semi-disaterous volcano cake which somehow she got away with. All the mummy's then came to pick their children up.</p><p>After Daddy got home for work we all went over to the Arena for a swim and a play with Ben's new sticks.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_05-08-Ben6thBirthday.jpg</src><caption>The Birthday Beast Quest Guests</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_05-17-Ben6thBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Cake time</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_05-20-Ben6thBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Beautiful Party Organizer</caption></image>

    <title>Bushey Park - Kayak Walton to Kingston - Kelley's for BBQ</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we were rushed. Daddy actually bought a mobile phone which cost him a whole £30. £25 more than he's ever spent on a phone before.</p><p>We split in two teams: Mummy, Ben and Jessica went to Bushy park to play on the swings whilst Daddy decided to kayak on the next leg of the Thames journey. Armed with an extra seat and some new gloves they set off down the Thames stopping off at Hampton for a spot of lunch. Katie had a few goes at paddling and now has got the hang of it and quite proficient.</p><p>We waited so long at both locks that Daddy found an alternative at Molesey. We slid down some rollers especially made for small craft like ours. The last 3 miles of our 8 mile journey was a bit of a rush as we needed to meet Mummy by 2pm. Finally we met at Kingston bridge.</p><p>Later in the afternoon we had the Kelley's over for a BBQ and play. Daddy had got some meat from the butchers. Mmmm.</p>

    <title>Walk 20: London Spies Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>Continuing with our London walks book we drove and parked by Notting Hill Gate to begin our 4 mile adventure. First up was a detour to Hyde Park and a go on the Pirate Ship playground and a picnic.</p><p>We then walked down the very impressive Kensington Palace Gardens, a little gem of a street. It mostly houses embasses. We tried to spot all the different countries and their flags. We then cut across Hyde Park to the Albert memorial which we always think looks pretty impressive.</p><p>Next the Royal Albert Hall and a cut through to the Science Museum. There were some pretty heavy showers around so decided to spend half an hour in the basement playing in the kids zone.</p><p>We continued south past the impressive Michelen building on the Fulham Road before missing the James Bond's residence behind the Kings Road. We ended up at Sloane Square where our walk ended and our bus trip back to Notting Hill began. We love our walks. So nice to see all the different architecture and posh places.</p><p>Daddy dropped the car off for its MOT before jogging home through the woods. It passed, costing only £130. Auntie Charlotte has come to stay for a few days.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_07-03-LondonSpiesWalk.jpg</src><caption>Beauts at Hyde Park</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_07-21-LondonSpiesWalk.jpg</src><caption>Barclays Bikes</caption></image>

    <title>CNL Fun Day</title>
    <info>
		<p>Early in the morning Farfar popped over to say hello and drop off some goodies for our holiday tomorrow. Daddy had his works do at the exotic Frimley Lodge Park. Thankfully the weather held out and we were able to cycle down. A bit nerve racking, will the children behave themselves in front of the CEO and family. We started off playing with Dane and his family before embarking on a full on game of rounders. Ben was very keen to play and endeered everyone with his enthusasm. Katie was a little shy, and although wanted to participate in her heart, her head said no. Mummy also joined in. After being thrashed, we started a game of football. Ben again very enthusiastic. Meanwhile, Lena, the CEO's wife, took Katie and Jessica and made up some jewelery bags which was very kind of her. BBQ up next then a hard fought match of tug of war. Boys only. That was a lot of fun. We said our goodbyes mid-afternoon, went over to the playground for a bit before cycling home and having an early night for our adventure tomorrow.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_13-15-CNLBBQ.jpg</src><caption>Tug Of War</caption></image>

    <title>Wales Holiday - Chester Zoo</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy said that a holiday isn't a holiday without an early start. The alarm clock rang at 5:15am. It had just turned light outside. We left at 6:15 relatively calm and headed up north. Mummy liked these early starts so she could go to sleep 15 minutes into the journey. Well that's what Bracknell would do to me at 6:30 on a Sunday morning!</p><p>We made good progress and stopped just a couple of times and reached Chester zoo at 10:15. Believed to be the largest zoo in the country. We got stuck at the kiosk as the man said that the online tickets we had purchased were used the day before. He finally let us in and straight away we saw a family of 5 elephants. There were two real young'uns playing with each other up and down a slope. Another of the older elephants was demolishing a large branch of leaves. Fascinating seeing it snap and chomp at the wood. The weight of their excrement exceeds the weight of Daddy and Katie but together on a daily basis!</p><p>We next saw some amazing monkies which were swinging about, playing around, preening one another and generally very absorbing to watch. We all thought that Ben was most like a monkey. He agreed. We went anti-clockwise around the park, seeing all sorts of animals from rhinos to bats to fat old snakes. Katie was braver than mummy in going into the Bat'ery. We saw a pelican, a zebra, a lion which was roaring pretty loud later on, a beautiful jaguar, a cheetah, orangutans, baboons, serval and meerkats. The tigers were hidden which was a bit of a disapointment, but overall we rated the zoo highly and stayed till the end, 6pm.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_14-67-WalesHoliday-ChesterZoo.jpg</src><caption>Spot the Gorilla</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_14-47-WalesHoliday-ChesterZoo.jpg</src><caption>Mummy and Daddy</caption></image><p>Our hotel was a short drive away and overlooked the amputheatre in Chester city centre.

    <title>Wales Holiday - Chester, Rhos On Sea, Gypsy Wood, Caenarfon</title>
    <info>
		<p>We have a nice cup of tea when we wake up. Jessica asked Ben if she could have one and Ben obliged and decided to get the kettle which had boiled and pour a tea for her. Unfortunately he missed the cup and poured the hot, scalding water over Jessica's hand. Oh how she wailed! No long lasting damage thank goodness.</p><p>Before setting off Daddy had noticed the lovely river Dee and nearby gardens close to where he had parked the car. Therefore he rallied the troop and set off for a walkabout Chester. First the amputheatre where Katie and Ben put on a little performance. Then we went passed the city walls, and old, old church, through the gardens and down to a suspension bridge spanning the Dee. We posed for some photos before walking along the lovely promenade back to the car. We had forgotten the pushchair in that unmentionable restaurant and funnily enough none of the staff could help us. So our pushchair was stolen! Brilliant!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_15-26-WalesHoliday-RhosOnSeaGypsyWoodCaernarfon.jpg</src><caption>Ben walking by the River Dee</caption></image><p>The promise of rain did not arrive, so we headed west to Colwyn Bay about an hour away. Mummy had read some more Famous Five, Adventure Island. Where we had parked up in Rhos On Sea, there was a little man made island to protect the beach. Ben was overjoyed. Let's swim across to our own adventure island! Katie a little more wise was a reluctant participant as she and Daddy could see how cold the water was going to be, and how rocky that man made island looked. We tip toed up to our chest before Ben could take it no more and returned to shore, leaving Daddy being encouraged by Katie to get in the water and swim across to the island. It was flipping cold but they both made it across. Katie was extremely sweet taking care of Daddy making sure he was OK. They reached the sumit of the rocks waved, played for a bit and then struggled against the current to get back on to the mainland!</p><p>Just across the road was a nice park with a paddling pool and swings so we went there for half an hour. Jessica being particularly cheeky with her bottom wiggles. That was fun.</p><p>We then had another hours journey west to Gypsy Wood. This place was hard to describe. It was in the same atmosphere as Black Gang Chine with its tacky ornaments spread through out the park. It was on a much smaller scale, and something a bit different for us to do. There was a model railway where you could control the speed and direction of the trains, a romany caravan which we loved playing in, plenty of small farm animals where Jessica actually stroked a goat and of course a play area. We went on the wetlands walk and finally saw the fairy godmother who painted a small tatoo on our arms. Mummy loved the place as much as we did. Again we stayed till closing time at 5pm.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_15-58-WalesHoliday-RhosOnSeaGypsyWoodCaernarfon.jpg</src><caption>Meeting the Fairy Godfather</caption></image><p>We headed 3 miles north to Caenarfon, dropped the bags off at the hotel and walked about the town. It was another lovely, walled town, with a huge castle next to the sea. Picture postcard. Lovely. Ben managed to trap his fingers under a heavy, massive dock ring. Ohh he cried. It started to rain so we decided to have our fish and chips in a restaurant. We tried to have an early night in preparation for tomorrows mountain expedition.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_15-66-WalesHoliday-RhosOnSeaGypsyWoodCaernarfon.jpg</src><caption>Meeting the Fairy Godfather</caption></image>

    <title>Wales Holiday - Snowdon, Aberystwyth, Cardigan, Pembroke Dock</title>
    <info>
		<p>It rained quite a bit overnight and into this morning. We had our cereal in our room and made a hasty exit to get to Llanbaris station by 9am. We have a suitcase and about 10 small bags to transport between car and hotel room so it's always a bit of a mission to get out in the morning. Daddy stupidly left Mummy in charge of booking the train tcikets. She bought the expensive tickets so cost us £69! It was only a 5 mile journey. Daddy said it was far too long for us to walk back and said that's why the plan said a return ticket! Anyway the evocitive smell of steam trains made Daddy forget about the expense and fall in love with steam again. It was a quaint station, red paint everywhere. We got into compartment B and we were steadily pushed up the mountain by a dirty diesel. We saw a gushing river beside us which turned into a spectacular waterfall a little higher up. There were sheep grazing in the most dangerous of places. At the edge of cliff faces it seemed. One false move and it was 'baaaah splat'. We shared seats with a daddy and a 5 year old who very kindly shared his sweets. We got chatting and the children played. I don't they were particularly interested after 10 minutes of the hour long climb, especially as the visibility was so poor and misty.</p><p>We eventually reached the end stop. We spent 15 minutes eating some food in the cafe and deliberating whether to take the train down. Experienced climbers cme to us and basically laughed at the fact that we were going to attempt to walk down the mountain. A couple of blokes said our passage down would be extremely windy, coupled with the rain it would be a miserable descent. What swung it for Daddy was the fact that those who had climbed the mountain were soaked through even though they wore all the best gear. Daddy was still reluctant as it had cost close to £70 to get up and the thought of a total spend of £140 was killing him. Even though he was only wearing shorts he was prepared to walk down to save money. The station master took pity and only charged us half price for the five of us to go down.</p><p>Having sorted all that out we ventured out, climbed the steps to the top, saw nothing but mist, cold rain and wind before swivelling 180 degrees to return to the cafe and the train.</p><p>It was an expensive disapointment due to the poor weather. One day we will be back to do it properly.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_16-09-WalesHoliday-SnowdinAberwyswyth.jpg</src><caption>Llanberis Station</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_16-00-WalesHoliday-SnowdinAberwyswyth.jpg</src><caption>Snowdownia</caption></image><p>Midday arrived so decided to hot foot it east past Snowdon and the picturesque pass before heading south west. Pembroke Dock our overnight stay. We drove quite a bit before stopping at Aberystwyth. We sat on the beach, had a cuppa, then did some rock-pooling. We caught a crab. Daddy is learning how to pick them up. He's still not sure on the best technique without being pinsered. The beach was quite shingley so was unable to make any sandcastles. Still we collected plenty of stones which ew of course now had to take on our travels.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_16-26-WalesHoliday-SnowdinAberwyswyth.jpg</src><caption>Jessica at Aberystwyth</caption></image><p>All this driving meant that we finsihed our first Famous Five book and moved onto 'Five Meet Again'. We stopped off again at Cardigan. This was not such an impressive place as Aberystwyth. We played on the swings by the river bank, made a welsh friend, but didn;t stay too long before making the final leg down to Pembroke Dock. Arriving at about 5:30pm, the place was a bit of a has-been place. Past glories and all that. After checking in, we walked down the high street for food and the place was pretty deserted. We were after pizza, there was only Chinese or Fish and Chips. We bought chipies and took them to a park which overlooked the bay. We got in at about 8:30 for lights out.</p>

    <title>Wales Holiday - Folly Farm, Tenby</title>
    <info>
		<p>We woke latish and got our picnic supplies for the day, before exiting the slightly disapointing Pembroke Dock and arriving at Folly Farm. The weather was fine and the kiddies were on fire with excitement. First up was a mobbing of the Peppa Pig characters. I think it was Jessica's dream moment to give Peppa a kiss! There was so much to do in the park. I think 'Farm' understated what actually was on offer. There were plenty of adventure playgrounds and ride on tractors. I think that alone could have consumed our day. We went in the indoor barn where Katie and Ben had a go at milking a goat. Katie said it was like Ben's winky!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_17-34-WalesHoliday-FollyFarmTenby.jpg</src><caption>George Pig with Jessica Pig</caption></image><p>Next up was the tractor ride which took us around fields of pigs, horses, donkies, lamas, deer and goats. It was quite loud and plenty of laughter, although I am not sure why. We then went to the giraffes. Mummy was fascinated at the obvious courtship between two of them. We saw zebras, red river boars, a monkey, reindeer, tortoise, osterich and a bongo. We went into the animal magic show.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_17-24-WalesHoliday-FollyFarmTenby.jpg</src><caption>Daddy Pig</caption></image><p>Last up was the soft play, again they could spend a fair few hours on that alone, and the old time fairground which was fantastic. We had goes on the helter scelter and the waltzer. We could have spent two days there I reckon, but we had an agenda to stick to so had to leave in the late afternoon.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_17-42-WalesHoliday-FollyFarmTenby.jpg</src><caption>Waltzer</caption></image><p>Tenby was not far away and we had rave reviews from everyone we spoke to about it and it didn't disapoint. We dumped the car and walked down to the harbour. The tide was on the turn and coming in fast. This time Mummy said she would brave the sea and Daddy was on tide and Jessica watch. True to form Ben exited early complaing of the cold, Katie stayed right out there for a bit with the roly polying Mummy!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_17-50-WalesHoliday-FollyFarmTenby.jpg</src><caption>The Tenby Team</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_17-00-WalesHoliday-FollyFarmTenby.jpg</src><caption>The Tenby Threesome</caption></image><p>There was a huge rock in the middle of the beach that daddy decided to climb. He got half way up before a lifeguard came across and to go no higher as someone fell down it last week. Tenby town was very nice and certainly had the atmosphere of a hot holiday seaside town. Not tacky or over commercialized, but full of nice cafes and boutiques. We stepped in one of the cafes which was offering free childrens food. Mummy and Daddy had lasagne, whilst Jessica and Ben had meatballs and pasta. Finally a day without chips. The weather had been fine all day. In fact we've had very little rain all holiday.</p><p>It was now 8pm and we still had an hours journey to our Travelodge near Swansea! The kiddies favourite day on the holiday so far. Folly Farm got a big thumbs up from the Gay jury.</p>

    <title>Wales Holiday - The Gower</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today was Mummy nostalgia day. The Gower was Mummy's childhood holiday destination. For about 10 years the Weston took the caravan down the Gower for their annual beach holiday. Mummy and Daddy went here over 10 years ago, but it's nice to come back to show the children around. As we left the rather disapointing Pembroke Dock, a local told us to visit a local waterfall and walk, so we did. It was called Penllergaer Valley Woods. We had a great time building a dam in the stream, although it was freezing cold.  Only Daddy saw the waterfall as the rest of us were getting peckish and went back to the car. We love a valley walk with a stream. Oh the excitement.</p><p>Finally the Gower and Llanmadoc. The tide was out and there must have been a miles worth of walking to the actually sea from the start of the beach. Anyway the beach was gorgeous, so clean, spacious and sandy. Other families were building dams on contributories to the sea. So we continued the trend and built one which was the first that was successful. Well for about 20 minutes anyway. Once the dam broke all the other downstream dams had to cope with a relative torrent! We did walk the mile to the sea where Katie and Jessica were doing some kind of sand dancing. That Jessica has got a screw lose I swear. We hooked up with a couple of families whilst there. One from Brighton who helped maintain the dams and another local who had a real broad Wlesh accent. We love it. She thought Folly Farm was expensive, when we thought it was good value. She didn't have much money, so it's all relative I supose.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_18-00-WalesHoliday-TheGower.jpg</src><caption>Tai Chi Jessa</caption></image><p>Anyway we then drove what seemed to be an eternity looking for other beaches that Mummy frequented. We went to Oxwich Bay, which wasn't the beach we were looking for. We then went to Southgate, got out for a short walk, but still not the beach we were looking for. The final Beach was Caswell Bay, which Mummy pretended to be the beach we were looking for as she was too afraid to admit it was the wrong one. We spent all afternoon driving from one cove to another. Anyway, we stopped as the beautiful Caswell Bay, played a bit of cricket, climbed some rocks, Katie went in the sea which was a brave feat seeing it was pretty cold. We had a nice time there, although Daddy's childhood cricket bat got stolen!</p><p>We travelled to the Mumbles, but time was marching on and we had to get to our hotel in the centre of Swansea as well as find a pizzeria for dinner. We eventually got to the hotel very late after driving around Swansea a bit. The hotel was right in the centre of the city and we were 5 floors up, along with a load of A-Level students. We were expecting a noisey night. To the students credit, we didn't hear a peak and we all slept soundly.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_18-38-WalesHoliday-TheGower.jpg</src><caption>Rock Climbers</caption></image>

    <title>Wales Holiday - Swansea Swim, National Show Caves, Cardiff</title>
    <info>
		<p>We got to Swansea Leisure Centre for the 9am start, thinking we can take advantage of a quiet pool. It boasts being the biggest leisure pool in the Britain. We were not too sure about that. However, there weren't many there to start off so Daddy, Katie and Ben all made hay on the flumes. First up the one where you need an inflatable. We went down.... and then up in some parts. Brilliant. We all loved it. There were two other slides as well which were very good. Jessica had plenty of things to play in as well. There was this board surfer thing as well. A seperate area to simulate a surf where gushing water was poured through and you had to balance your self on a body board. I guess you can use it to practice surfing.</p><p>We done our 2 hours and sped north out of the city, up through the valleys and stopped off somewhere very countrified for a nice little picnic. We then continued our journey to the Welsh National Show Caves or Dan Yr Ogof as the locals would say. Well we spent £50 on what amounted to a 2.5 hour stay. Not value for money. Saying that, we went in some good caves. A year ago Katie was quite scared, but she'd overcome that fear over the past year. Jessica however was a little more aware and took the 'scaredy cat' baton. Still it was all very pretty inside and Daddy mucked about with his camera settings to get a few firey looking shots.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_19-03-WalesHoliday-WalesNationalShowCaves.jpg</src><caption>Picnic</caption></image><p>Not only were there caves, but the largest collection of Dinosaurs in the world, all life sized in the woods. Ben liked this and climbed on a few. However, on one near the entrance he climbed in the mouth, posed for a photo and then lost his balance, caught the dinosaurs tooth in his mouth, piercing the inside of his mouth, a making a small hole on the outside. Yuk. Poor chap. We all felt sorry for him.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_19-15-WalesHoliday-WalesNationalShowCaves.jpg</src><caption>Captain Cavemen</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_19-21-WalesHoliday-WalesNationalShowCaves.jpg</src><caption>Eaten by a dinosaur</caption></image><p>Uncle Barrie and Laura gave Ben £10 for his birthday. That money has been burning a hole in his pocket all holiday. Everyday he's wanted to spend it. He's finally spent the final £2 on some gems. This cheered him up no end. We visited the farm, the shire horses et al, before we have had enough and ventured our way to Cardiff with a mixture of the second of the Famous Five books and Test Match Special!</p><p>We stopped at a pub about a mile from the city centre and had a relaxing meal and pint. Mummy played board games with the kiddies whilst Daddy was in seventh heaven watching the England Test Match on a big tele.</p><p>We quickly went past Cardiff Castle before taking our city centre hotel location. Daddy continued with his tightness on the parking front and parked out a bit. We've not had to pay for any parking on the whole holiday. It did mean we had to leave by 8am next morning! Daddy went out in the city centre for a wonder and saw the Millenium Stadium. It was all dark and locked up unfortunately. Overnight there was trouble in the room next to us. They were having trouble evicting the party and eventually called the police. Anyway we didn't have the best night's sleep.</p>

    <title>Wales Holiday - Swindon, Barnett Visitors</title>
    <info>
		<p>We left by 8am and headed home. We stopped off at Swindon Outlet centre to get Katie some shoes for school. We eventually got home by about 1pm. It then started the rain. We were pretty lucky with the weather all week. I think the boys wore shorts all week.</p><p>Later in the afternoon Steve, Joyce and Eva all popped over for a cuppa and to give Ben his birthday present which was very nice.</p>

    <title>Farfar's 65th Birthday, Watercress Line</title>
    <info>
		<p>Tomorrow is Farfar's birthday, however, today was the day we went to the Watercress line with the Tremears as well. We set off from Alton on a steam train, stopped off at Ropley for lunch and a play. Farfar mentioned it was 50 years today that he started on the railway at Woking station. We went to Alresford and back on a dirty diesel, before exploring the engine shed and had a go on the playground back at Ropley. Farfar received odd socks from us and of course our lovely cards and a nice wristwatch from his children. We trundled into Alton station with the adults reminissing the old rolling stock, the slidey windows and old style seating arrangements. You can't beat the smell of a steam train. Happy 65th Birthday Farfar.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_21-05-Watercress.jpg</src><caption>Farfar explaining to Ben about steam engines</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 21: Hampstead Heath Walk, Leah Sleepover</title>
    <info>
		<p>Another of our walks in London today took us around the perimeter of Hampstead Heath. We caught the overground train from Gunnersbury and alighted at Gospel Oak and began our circular walk. The weather was changable, but only once did we have to decamp to the trees. We were a little surprised as we were expecting Parliament Hill and not a lot else. However our 3 mile walk took in some great trees to climb, some woods, a stately home and some views which would make you think you were in the countryside, especially towards Highgate. We topped Parliament Hill pointing out all the landmarks. Great views.</p><p>We did briefly go in Kenwood House, but the end of walk highlight was a go in one of the best playgrounds around and eventually the paddling pool. We were planning to go in the impressive Lido but it was a little cold and we were running out of time. However, it looked quite inviting so we'll have to come back another day.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_27-00-HampsteadHeath.jpg</src><caption>Hampstead Heath</caption></image><p>We got back late afternoon and dropped Katie off at Leah's for a sleepover. She went down the pub and stayed up until 12:30am!!!!</p>

    <title>Wellington Country Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had a change of venue this morning for church. For the whole of last week we went to church club at Frimley C of E and enjoyed ourselves. Highlight was the daily play which evolved into a thriller. To end, we had a special service at Frimley Baptist church.</p><p>We then headed over to the Barnett's at Spencers Wood and hooked up with little Eva and parents for an afternoon at Wellington Country Park. Unfortunately the weather was not the kindest, still the picnic prepared by Steve and Joyce made up for that disapointment. Eva was certainly a hungry lady and was quite happy with the attention that Jessica was giving her. We had a go on the playground and another playground and then a jolly train driver took us around the Wellington loop.</p><p>We visited the farm where your courage was tested. Who dared feed the animals? Ben was straight in there followed by Katie, Jessica and Steven. I'm sure that's a first for Jessica. Another trip in the playground and zip slide before the weather won and we aborted. Thanks to Steve, Joyce and Eva for a lovely afternoon.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_28-01-WellingtonCountryPark.jpg</src><caption>Picnic'ers</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_08_28-10-WellingtonCountryPark.jpg</src><caption>Feed the goat</caption></image><p>In the evening we packed for our camping holiday next week.</p>

		<p>Finally Daddy had his work review. The salary increase promised 3 years ago was finally agreed to go ahead with the backpay. That coupled with the inheritance money from Aunt Olive, a distant relative, means things are a little easier in the good ship Gay.</p>

We even caught Uncle Richard playing on his own for about 5 minutes before Auntie Karen asked what was going on.</p><p>Paula was at a wedding today, so we looked after Natasha and decided we would try and go for one of our walks in Richmond. However, the rugby was on which we got caught in the Twickenham traffic for over an hour. We decided to turn back and go to Staines and our old stomping ground, Lammas Park. We playground'ed, scootered in the skate park and got wet in the sprayground. In the evening we watched Ma Mia and stayed up late together. Natasha slept in Katie's bed.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_09_03-04-StainesLammas.jpg</src><caption>Ben skater dude</caption></image>

    <title>Jessicas 4th Birthday Party - Kayak Kingston to Mortlake - Joey and Lily stay over</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today saw Daddy and Ben leave early for the Thames in the next chapter of the Eastward journey along the Thames. It was a major logistical operation with Daddy only wanting to paddle one way. So here goes the complicated bits:</p><p>They drove to Kingston bridge, locked the Kayak up to a post, jumped in the car and drove to Mortlake and parked the car near the river. Walked to Mortlake railway station, caught the train to Hampton Wick, with paddles, seats, lunch, etc. Walked to the Kayak and set sail towards Teddington at 9:35. Only 8 more miles to go.</p><p>Daddy started at quite a leisurely pace thinking that 8 miles in 3 hours was quite achievable. I mean it was supposed to be enjoyable and leisurely. However, it turned into a bit of a challenge and a race against the tide and time.</p><p>Ben was most helpful. In fact he commented that Daddy wouldn't have made it if it wasn't for him. True he did provide paddling assistance, even though it might not always have propelled us forward. He did also pass the sandwiches back, he made the kayak lighter when we stopped for the toilet 3 times and dropped the map into the river twice! However, it is questionable whether playing Sudoku on the phone or dropping his paddle into the river was gaining us time. The sweetest thing was near the end when Daddy was exerting a lot of effort and grunting away, Ben just started chanting 'Come On Daddy, come on. Come on Daddy come on'. Daddy could have given him the biggest cuddle.</p><p>We had some lunch which we ate onboard. We saw some nice wildlife, birds with big beaks, some nice houses, not many boats and lots of rowers. Ben was following the written plan. Interested in the train timetable and following ourselves on the map along the river. I think it did go on quite a time for the both of them. Ben wouldn't admit he was bored and always gave a positive outlook, however, Daddy suspects he would have been happy to stop after a couple of hours.</p><p>We eventually pulled the kayak out at 1:30pm and rushed home just about in time for Jessica's birthday.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_09_10-03-KingstonMortlakeKayak.jpg</src><caption>Ben kayaking</caption></image><p>This year Jessica's birthday party was going to be held at Tomlinscote School's sport hall, with inflatables, mats, toys, etc. Jessica has been so excited about her party. We think a 4 year old is probably the best age for this. For the past month Jeissca asks 'is it my party tomorrow?'</p><p>We had a mix of family, playschool friends and other friends coming along, which was really nice to see. Jessica was connected by an invisible magnetic force to her best friend Amy Huggits. They are so sweet together giving each other cuddles and generally looking out for each other.</p><p>After an hour of playtime we had party food around the back and a nice hedgehog cake. I think everyone enjoyed themselves, we certainly did.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_09_10-26-Jessicas4thBirthdayParty.jpg</src><caption>Jessa's birthday</caption></image><p>We returned home with the Elders. Before we could sit around and watch Jessica open her presents she had naughtily opened them!! Anyway she got so many nice presents.</p><p>In the evening we watched the first episode of Strictly Come Dancing before going to bed.</p>

    <title>Jessica 4th Birthday - Paulton's Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>We awoke early and Jessica opened some more presents from us lot. We left early for Paulton's Park. We needed to get there for when the gates opened so we could get a full day's worth of entertainment. We first headed off to Jessica's favourite, Peppa Pig world. She loved it in there and went on many rides. The older children enjoyed it, but were itching for something a little more thrill seeking. The queues were relatively short, something to do with the end of season and inclemtent weather. We met up with the Elders, Westons, Mr Peter Barnett and later the Fars.</p><p>We kept together as much as possible. Top rides for the older children were the Pirate Ship, The Edge (boat slide ride) and the Cobra rollercoaster. Auntie Sue and Richard also came along with Felicity and Fraser. We had another cake and another happy birthday for Jessica who really did enjoy her day. We stayed until 5:30 when the rides all shut. Expensive, but a good day had by all.</p><p>Jessica is 99.5cm in height. Which is a bit of luck as little-uns over a 1 metre have o pay £20!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_09_11-16-PaultonsPark.jpg</src><caption>Oh Me hartys</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_09_11-22-PaultonsPark.jpg</src><caption>Mikey and Benny on the boat</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_09_11-32-PaultonsPark.jpg</src><caption>On the Jumping Jack</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_09_11-65-PaultonsPark.jpg</src><caption>Another cake</caption></image>

    <title>Dixons Over</title>
    <info>
		<p>The Dixons came over to visit for a spot of food and some playtime. The weather was not particularly kind for our walk to the swingpark. Yasmin and Reuben were on good form, Mr Dixon was doing his best to mess the house as much as the kiddies. He squeezed some toy frog which spurted out a load of yellow jelly which ended up all over the floor, sofa and wall. It was very funny to see David's reaction, the surprise on his face.</p><p>It was really nice to see Yasmin playing with everyone. Reuben was well pleased with a particularly noisey helicopter.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_09_17-06-DixonsOver.jpg</src><caption>Reuben-ator</caption></image>

    <title>Basingstoke Canal Kayak</title>
    <info>
		<p>After church Daddy went to the Basingstoke Canal centre where he met up with Gerry, Howard, Susan and the Elders where they planned a trip up to the Swan pub in Ash Vale. We all got a bit wet mainly due to the paddle splashing. Gerry almost fell in when disembarking from the Kayak which would have been funny. Both he and Michael sat at the pub with their trousers off! A little strange. Differernt crew on the return journey. Near the end it began to rain so we quickly packed up and came back home for a cup of tea.</p>

    <title>Walk 22: Coram Boy London Walk, British Museum - Elders for Dinner</title>
    <info>
		<p>We headed to Wimbledon and parked fro our tube journey upto King Cross. We headed south through the back streets down to Coram's Field, an area dedicated to children. We all had something nice their. Ben had a light sabre made for him out of a baloon, Jessica had a go on a fire hose, Katie went on the playground and Mummy saw a fireman she fancied!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_09_24-31-CoramBoyLondonWalk.jpg</src><caption>Coram Boy walk</caption></image><p>After having a spot of lunch their we continued south and eventually hit the British Museum and made our way to the Mummies. Katie is currently doing a school project on the Egyptians so she was interested in this. It's the first time any of us had been in the museum. Daddy liked the architecture of the main area with its glass roof.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_09_24-37-CoramBoyLondonWalk.jpg</src><caption>Mummies</caption></image><p>We hit the busy streets through Convent Garden where we stopped to watch a magic man. Well a magic boy. You could tell he was not very expereinced and we felt sorry for him a bit as his audience slowly lost interest and flittered away. He kept dropping the balls on the floor which were supposed to be hidden under the cups. A couple more playground stops down Drury Lane.</p><p>We bussed our way back to Waterloo and tubed it back to Wimbledon and then straight to Alton to have dinner at the Elders with the Glidewells. The Elders done a racklets dinner and Mummy got quite drunk!</p>

    <title>Boat Race Bike Ride</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy carefully balanced the bikes on the back of the car as we headed to outskirts of the capital. We began our bike ride following our walks book, doing the boat race route. Confused. We headed along the south bank, westwards, hitting a playground very early on. A millionaires playground. The parents of each child were well heeled, then there was us. Ben of course made us nervous cycling along hitting almost everybody it seemed! He certainly hit a rowing boat which was parked up along the side. We crossed Hammersmith bridge onto the north bank and stopped for our picnic, before continuing through Grove Park and to the turning point of Chiswick Bridge.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_09_25-01-BoatRaceBikeRide.jpg</src><caption>Preparing for the Boat Race Bike Ride</caption></image>

    <title>Swimming - Chiswick to Battersea Kayak</title>
    <info>
		<p>Muumy went to church to help clean the kitchen whilst the rest of us played at home. Daddy beat us at Stratego. After lunch we popped down to Farnborough Leisue centre for a swim. It wasn't too busy and Daddy threw us about and ate us in a game of sharks. We had our dive sticks with us. Katie swum the length of the pool, even though some of it was backstroke.</p><p>Later Daddy went for another of his Kayak trips. Setting off from Chiswick Bridge were he got annoyed with some pushy, women rowers and got disheartened with the tough tidal conditions. Although it was only a bit off high tide it took over 45 minutes just to do a mile. Having struggled all the way to Hammersmith bridge he stopped for some refreshments and a rest. Just two miles down in 2 hours! However, the tide changed and it was a far more restful paddling up past Fulham FC and the Michael Jackson statue. Kayaking under the trees by Bishop's Park watching the sun setting behind made the trip all the worth while. There was the hubub of the Putney pubs and various groups of people waving to Daddy. Past the intended stopping point Daddy was cooking on the tide scooting under Wandsworth Bridge. There were some posh looking flats now and a feeling of really hitting the edge of London. The light was drawing in fast and 8.75 miles down, Daddy decide to make his way into the side at Battersea Bridge. He dragged his boat up some steps, locked it up then needed to get back to the car back at Chiswick Bridge. A 2.5 hour round trip with a walk to Clapham Juncton, a train ride a bus trip and returning car journey. At 9pm in the evening Daddy was dragging the Kayak down Battersea Bridge Road to the car. Daddy finally got home 10:15pm.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_10_01-06-PutneyKayak.jpg</src><caption>Battersea Bridge At Night</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 23: Hyde Park Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>After church we headed again up to London. We were told about a Disney Princess horse drawn parade through Hyde Park.... and we've got a walk for Hyde Park as well Mummy reminded us. We parked close to Queensway on what we thought was a valid parking spot. More of that later. It was a baking hot day, a barmy 28 degrees. We entered over by Kensington Gardens and wait a good long while for the 10 Disney princesses to parade through in their horse drawn carriages. Ben was not bothered at all but the girls loved it.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_10_02-03-HydeParkWalk.jpg</src><caption>Jeesica and Princess Aerial</caption></image><p>The procession didn't take too long and we started our circular walk down Flower Walk. We got a bit lost heading to the little pond, but found the Diana Memorial Fountain well enough. It was absolutely packed. It was a bit different and we had fun going around it.... twice. Of course we all got soaked! Us kiddies were on bikes for this one which helped with the pace. The Italian fountains were disapointingly fenced off and the Pirate Ship playground was full to capacity, so we headed back to the car, which unfortunately was not parked in a valid spot. We looked at the wrong sign. £65 marred the afternoon a little.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_10_02-29-HydeParkWalk.jpg</src><caption>Princess Diana Memorial</caption></image>

We stopped there for an hour or so, just enough time to get the railway track, the  farm, and the tea trolley out, as well as raid the Cream Cracker tin! We then dropped Mummy off at Cross Farm school as she kindly volunteered to help do work around the place, like sweep leaves.</p><p>Meanwhile, Daddy took us over to Hatch Warren Community Centre for Fraser and Felicity's birthday party. Joey and Lily also came. There was a magic man who we absolutely loved. Lily won a prize at the limbo and Jessica for best girl dancer.</p><p>In the afternoon we made ice cream whilst Daddy went to see Chertsey lose 5-2 at Uxbridge.

    <title>Walk 24: Roman London Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>After church we headed for another of our London's walks. Today we started at the Tower Of London where we picniced. Ben was quite interested in it. Mummy and Daddy vowed to go in there with us one day when they were a bit richer! There were lots of tourists milling about. Anyway the sergeant major ordered the troops along a well troden path. Well troden as we've done some of this route before. Cannon Street station to the Guildhall, then on to London Wall and finally ending up at the 70's architecture of the Barbican. We had a right old laugh playing games along the way with Daddy. He would eat us if we trod on the cracks. Later, if we laughed then also this would result in tickles to the ribs. Jessica meanwhile hitched a lift on Mummy's shoulders. We caught the number 100 bus back to Tower Hill and drove home for Sunday lunch.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_10_16-11-LondonRomanWalk.jpg</src><caption>Tower Of London Escapees</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_10_16-22-LondonRomanWalk.jpg</src><caption>Crazzzzyy Kids</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_10_16-39-LondonRomanWalk.jpg</src><caption>Targetted</caption></image>

    <title>Ben's first football match - Daddy at Everton v Manchester United</title>
    <first name="benjamin">Played competitive football match</first>
    <info>
		<p>Ben had his first competitive match for Frimley. He was really looking forward to it. For some reason he'd been left out of the loop for the first part of the season. It took Daddy to have a word with the manager so he could join in. He donned his Chertsey Town'esque strip which meant you could barely see his legs. So sweet. The Elders came along for support. We lost 4-1 with Ben putting a lot of effort on chasing after the ball. Ben was well chuffed at winning the man of the match trophy for the week. Well done Ben.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_10_29-03-BenFirstFootball.jpg</src><caption>Ben with his Man Of The Match Trophy</caption></image><p>In the afternoon we went to Frimley Lodge Park to do some pumpkin carving. However they had run out of pumpkins so just played for a bit there.</p><p>Daddy went up with Steven and two friends from work to Liverpool last night in preparation for the Everton v Manchester United match. Things did not start well when Jason's car was clamped at Michael's house. £125 for the 30 minute priviledge!</p><woops woopstitle="Spinout at 75mph" rating="5"><p>Things did not get better when on the M4. We heard a car with a rythmic thumping noise overtake us in the fast lane. The rythmic thump was due to the puncture that the car had incurred but which the occupants did not have full knowledge of. Just as they passed, the car swerved violently in front of us, one way then the other, eventually ending up facing the wrong way on the hard shoulder. Goodness knows how they didn't hit anyone or even damage the car. Oh how we laughed.</p></woops><p>Five and a half hours later we arrived in Liverpool via the Wirral. After a bit of fun with no GPS signal, we parked at the hotel in the centre of town, decamped, everyone laughing at Katie's Mickey Mouse suitcase. I was sharing a room with Steve.</p><p>We headed back out for some drinking. Within 5 minutes of being on the streets I was offered to buy some cocaine!! Where have we come to? We respectively declined, then hit a number of bars and clubs - the chaps admiring my skills on the dance floor!! It was a 4:30am finish time!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_10_29-01-EvertonTrip.jpg</src><caption>Daddy giving it some on the dance floor</caption></image><p>We woke in the morning with two hours to spare; a bit of a rush to Goodison Park. The weather was slightly chilly, dull but dry. With such an early kick off the atmosphere was a little muted, not much chanting at all. Michael had got great tickets, front row, allbeit in the Everton end.</p><p>Manchester United had scored in the 19th minute, after which they pretty much sat back an invited Everton on to them. Fortunately they did not find a route through. A draw would have been a fair result. It was good to see the likes of Rooney close up. He was a class apart. He seemed to have so much time on the ball and played cultured little chips here and there. I was quite surprised how much bickering there was between players. Vidic was the instigator of most of that.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_10_29-05-EvertonTrip.jpg</src><caption>Wayne Rooney at Goodison</caption></image><p>Once the game finished we made the four hour journey back home.... without incident.</p>

		<p>In the evening, after work, Mummy and Daddy went to an Italian restuarant in Gravesend town centre.</p><woops woopstitle="Laura crashes car into Daddy's motorbike" rating="7"><p>Laura was following Martin who was on his motorbike to Pop Pop's 65th birthday meal. It was dark and raining. In Ripley, Martin stopped at a T-Junction a car was coming so waited. However, Laura had other ideas. She pounced and hadn't realized Martin was still waiting at the junction. She went straight into the back of the motorbike, hitting the exhaust quite hard. Fortunately Martin was only pushed into the side of the road and not into the oncoming car. The exhaust stayed firm. The car's body work did not. The exhaust went straight through where the fog lights go. As they parked 10 yards up the road, the car was making an almighty sound. It was the sound of the plastic housing for the fog light scraping along the road under the car. The wheel arch inners was also rubbing against the front wheel. Martin didn't even shout at Laura, instead had to fix the problems. After a bit of jiggery pokery they were off on their merry way again.</p></woops><p>We rarely see the Weston half of the family so it was nice to see everyone, and on top form as well. We saw Young and the boyfriends of Jo and Hannah.</p>

    <title>Football, Ballet, Grandma's 86th Birthday, Fireworks</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning the Girls walked to Ballet in Frimley Green, whilst the boys biked to football at Marconi's. This week Ben played the full match and Daddy turned up in his Frimley Panthers kit! Ben did really well in midfield continously running. He had one good chance that he carved himself out, however, he dragged his shot just wide. Otherwise the team did suffer from a lack of options and a goalkeeper who walked off after it went 2-0. From a scoreline of 0-0 at half time we capitulated to a 5-0 defeat.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_11_05-02-FrimleyVMychettFootball.jpg</src><caption>Commanding Midfielder</caption></image><p>In the afternoon we took Great Grandma out to the garden centre in Badshot Lea where we met up with the Elders and Pete. We perused around the shop, minding the china and immitating the parrot. We had a nice cup of tea in the cafe and a little much about in the playground. We bumped into Auntie Lindey surprisingly as well.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_11_05-02-GardenCenterElders.jpg</src><caption>Jessica in playground</caption></image><p>In the evening we went down to Grove school for their bonfire and firework display. The Fars joined us right at the front, which meant we felt the heat from the fire. The fireworks went off well. No crying or being scared and it was very mild no moaning about being cold. This fact needs recording because it'll be the first time ever!!</p><p>We popped home afterwards for our traditional baked potato, tomato soup and sparklers.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_11_05-16-GardenCenterElders.jpg</src><caption>Katie the sparkler</caption></image>

    <title>Banger Racing, Jakes Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>After church the girls stayed at home to do lots of homework, then went out in the afternoon to a birthday party at Jakes.</p><p>Meanwhile the boys joined the Fars, Pop Pop, Auntie Susan and Graham, Uncle Howard and Susan and Uncle Pete at the annual Firecracker Banger racing event in Essex. Again the mildish and dry weather meant it was not hard to watch.</p><p>There were about 9 races with a mixture of 'normal' cars and Reliant Robin races. Ben had been looking forward to this for ages after last year’s experience. We got there for the first race which after 2 minutes stopped with the ambulance coming out!</p><p>Our favourites where the Robins which provided a lot of entertainment with some big impacts, taking into account their fibre glass shell. It was so funny to see the cars wobbling their way back onto their three wheels once they had been toppled onto their side.</p><p>We made a few excursions into the pits to see the cars. There were loads of Jags, some 1970s American cars, limos, hearses and even a Rolls Royce. On the Robin side there was a stretch limo robin; brilliant! Ben sat in a couple of the cars which was bit of an experience for him.</p><p>The final two destruction derby's supplied the best action with cars going in all directions. The track was on fire at one point which was funny to see. The final last DD had 48 cars competing. The stretched limo blocked one end of the track.</p><p>Ben loved it and wants to go again soon. He also wants the DVD.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_11_06-00a-FirecrackerBangerRacing.jpg</src><caption>Ben in the hot seat</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_11_06-00b-FirecrackerBangerRacing.jpg</src><caption>Banger action</caption></image>

    <title>Football, Ballet, Rushforths, Fars Overnight Stay</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy and Jessica went for a an extended ballet session in preparation for the upcoming show. Meanwhile the rest of us went over to Grayshott for the next installment of Frimley Green Cheetahs. The Elders came for support and of course to play on the swings. Unfortunately Ben started off as substitute and he waited patiently for his chance. He got on just before half time and had a couple of chances to score himself. He played in midfield and kind of goes into a trance and chases 2 yards away from the ball. He does try hard. The team played very well and won their first match 5-2.</p><p>Later in the afternoon we got dropped off at the Fars where we made camps and christmas presents. Katie went to the Rushforths for a couple of hours where she made a lovely Christmas Advent Calander which she can hang from her bed. We all had late nights. Jessica and Ben slept downstairs in their den!</p><p>Meanwhile Daddy and Mummy went over to the Surrey Cricketers for Pop Pop and Auntie Sue's 60th birthday celebration. We saw many of the Allen family.</p>

    <info>
		<p>We awoke at the Fars and snuck into their bed. Mummy collected us for church parade. Katie had Megan's birthday party immediately afterwards at Tomlinscote. Daddy worked and went for a 4.5 mile jog.</p><p>In the afternoon we went for a bike ride down to Heatherside swings. We saw the Bandoz crew and someone Daddy knew from football. We of course played crocodiles which the Bandoz's loved as well as a super high push on the basket!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_11_13-03-HeathersideSwings.jpg</src><caption>Swing high sweet Katie</caption></image>

		<p>We had the usual round of ballet in the morning, with Daddy, Ben and Katie going off to Watchetts to for the local derby, Frimley Green v Camberley. Ben got just half a game again this week. He said that he was the worst player on the team. We could have cried for him. Still the team drew 1-1. Still Ben does enjoy the social side of the team.</p><p>In the afternoon we done some homework and other jobs around the house. Daddy cooked a nice spaghetti bolognese. We got ready for tonight's Strictly Come Dancing. Mummy went out for her Vampire film night and didn't get home till gone 1am!</p><p>A list of the clubs currently</p><ul><li><i>Katie</i>Brownies

    <title>Battersea To St Katherines Dock Kayak, Joey H's birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went along with Mummy to church as normal whilst Daddy got everything ready for his next leg of the Thames tour by kayak.</p><p>Ben had Joey Harris's birthday party down at Runabout. He loved going down in Joey Dad's van with the rest of the boys.</p><p>Katie was well up for going with Daddy on probably the most exciting leg of his Kayaking tour, the Central London bit. We parked up and Katie helped Daddy carry the kayak up the road which was full of traffic. One person unwound their window and asked what we were doing. He was most impressed. We eventually found a place in which to cast off. The tide was on it's way down which meant there was a lot of rubbish lying on the river bed in which we could see. Katie saw an old shoe and there was plenty of broken glass.</p><p>We set off and fortunately Daddy had got the tide times right so it wasn't too much effort to glide past the bridges. We went passed one lot of Kayak from a club, but we were free to go where we liked and at what pace. It was really to see some really modern flats along with some derilicted buildings. In the early stages we were counting the bridges that we went under. Eventually we got as far Westminster and cruised past Big Ben and saw the London Eye. By now we had to contend with the various tourist boats from the Duck to speed boats and the big crusiers whizzing down the river. It was becomming rather choppy and we were on wet bottom alert. Katie was helping a bit on the paddling but to be honest we didn't need to work very hard. It was nice to see the sights from a different angle on seemingly on our own.</p><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/TC8wSZ5cpK4&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/TC8wSZ5cpK4&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object><p>Katie's stomach was telling us that it was time for lunch and rather head towards the river bank we decided to moor up against a tug, climbed up aboard and started our sunday lunch, well it was a picnic really. We managed to attract quite a bit of attention from Waterloo bridge with a dozen or so people taking pictures of us for some reason. Katie was running up and down and letting her imagine run away with her. Still it was time to move on so we continued eastwards. Unknowningly we got blasted on the horn from one of the big boats, 30 seconds later the captain of the boat got on the megaphone and told us and London it seemed for us to move out of the way!! We also got shouted at by a worker to not go down one of the arches under Southwark bridge.</p><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/x2J1kqUtpJw&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/x2J1kqUtpJw&amp;hl=en_GB&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="480" height="385"></embed></object><p>We went right down the centre of Tower Bridge which was the initial aim. Katie was begining to get cold due to the wet bottom so we pulled in at the next available spot which was just past St. Katherine's Dock. As we were getting out a lot of wash came our way and absolutely soaked us. We locked up the kayak and walked through the posh bit of the dock, and splodged our way to the Tower Of London and caught a bus to Trafalgar Square where we waited ages. We got talking to a lady at the bus stop who told us the best way back to the car. She even walked us to the bus stop! It took ages for us to get back. Having got to the car we had to drive across London to St Katherine's Dock to pick up the kayak and then drive home. This last big of logistics took 5 hours! A great adventure.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_11_20-00-CentralLondonKayak.jpg</src><caption>Kayaking Central London</caption></image>

    <title>Ballet, Football, Liam's Birthday, Bike Ride, Leah Sleepover</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had Leah Sumner stay over last night which was nice for Katie. Those two played Nintendo DS all the time! They watched Mama Mia last night as well downstairs. We could hear them singing to all the songs!</p><p>Jessica is in the final throws of rehersals for her show next week. Mummy took her here, whilst the rest of us went to Marconi's for a home game against Churt. Ben again only got about half a game and touched the ball twice. Daddy changed tactics and tried being a bit more vocal and help him get in the right position and gee him up to get stuck in. Predictably Ben didn't take too kindly to this and got a bit upset so Daddy toned it down. At the end of the day he's there because he enjoys it, so Daddy's not going to push him. Daddy's just trying to help.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_11_26-03-FrimleyGreenVChurt.jpg</src><caption>Ben celebrating win</caption></image><p>Daddy and Ben then had Liam's birthday to go to down at Jakes in Bagshot.</p><p>In the afternoon Mummy went off with Auntie Charlotte to watch the Vampire film at Bracknell Cinema. The rest of us went on a bike ride down through the woods and through to a swing park near Richard and Sue's. We had some good games. It was a long way back up the massive hill! We watched 'Home Alone 2' and 'Strictly' off course.</p>

		<p>We went to church in the morning whilst Daddy worked at home. In the afternoon we had a three way split. Ben went to Thomas's birthday at Tomlinscote, Jessica had a marathon 3 hour rehersal of the Aspects Of Dance production that she is performing for real next week. Mummy, Daddy and Katie went to the Pine Ridge Open Day where Katie had her hair braided, a visit to Father Christmas, although Katie said it was one of his helpers and not the real one! Daddy had a go at the putting competition and failed!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_11_27-03-PineRidgeOpenDay.jpg</src><caption>Daddy and Katie just before visiting FC</caption></image>

    <title>Ben's Nativity As Joseph</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ben was the star turn in the school Nativity play. In his 4th and final performance both Mummy and Daddy were sat proud to see Ben walk down the centre aisle with his arm around Mary, taking care of his pregnant wife. He had 8 lines to deliver. Very clear, no fluffs. He did ever so well. Good work Ben. Later he said he was a little scared, but he's now sad that he's not carrying it on.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_12_01-01-BenNativityAsJoseph.jpg</src><caption>Mary and Joseph</caption></image><p>Karen and Evie popped in later in the afternoon for a cup of tea.

    <title>Ben Football, Xmas Fair, Jessica Ballet Performance, Katie 'Star Of The Week'</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had Katie parents evening during the week with Mrs Farage, a young, enthusiastic teacher. Anyway she reported that Katie was popular in class, behaves well and her work is getting much better. She is in top set for Maths, reading group and swimming. Just literacy she is in the second stream. However, she was very positive about Katie. We also were positive about the teacher. Never tries to get out of school or anything like that and we've noticed she got much better from last year. Just shows how much a teacher plays in the development of a child.</p><p>To cap a good week for her, she was awarded 'Star Of The Week' for smiling and cheering the teacher up in the mornings. Well done Katie.</p><p>Daddy went out with his old Formscape chums in Guildford. So nice to catch up after a year! Didn't get in until gone 1am!!!</p><p>Whilst Mummy, Katie and Ben cycled down to the Frimley C of E Christmas fair and helped run a stall, Daddy took Jessica to the 'Apects of Dance' bi-annual production. Jessica has been in rehersals for the past month. Anyway they went to a college in Farnborough where there was a proper stage and about 400 people in the audience. In the 2.5 show, with a mixture of different types of dances and age groups, Jessica was on stage for about 5 minutes. It was hard to pick her out amongst the 15 other youngsters on stage. She enjoyed herself and was in reflective mood on the way home. She had to do it all again in the evening with Mummy watching this time. She did ever so well. She was pretty proud that she went to bed later than Katie and Ben!!</p><p>We had the playgroup teddy to look after the weekend which Jessica was particularly protective over. We had to get photos.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_12_03-05-BalletJessica.jpg</src><caption>Jessica half in her soilder outfit</caption></image>

    <title>Fars Over</title>
    <info>
		<p>Relatively quiet day today. Daddy was again working. The rest of us went to church and Sunday school. We also picked up Daddy's motorbike which is always a terrifying experience as Daddy gets told off for the dangerous state of the bike. The main mechanic said that he had never seen a tyre in a worst condition than that. Beading going, 10psi of pressure and tread below legal standards. Also the chain was extremely slack! The other terrifying thing was the price. £267! Ouch.</p><p>In the afternoon the Fars came across for a little playtime.</p>

		<p>It was the playschool's Nativity play. The last we'll see here. We've seen the previous 6! Jessica was selected to be Mary the lead girl's role. Well she only had one line, "This is Jesus, the son of God." It was very sweet to see. Karen and Evie came along to watch as well.</p><p>Later Daddy went with Steven to Costco and acquired £200 worth of food and stuff for the party tomorrow.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_12_16-13-JessicaNativityAsMary.jpg</src><caption>Jessica 'Mary' Gay</caption></image>

    <title>Christmas Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>This year we had a couple of additions to the lineup this year. Barrie and Laura joined Jon, Rachel, Ellie, Michael, Helen, Nigel, Karen and Richard and an assortment of kids who by and large kept themselves to themselves. A total of 17 in the Gay household. We had the usual array of games plus a few new ones. The Mr and Mrs proved a bit personal in bits and embarrassing for some! The usual cheating in Titles, Michael surpassed his reputation with a guess  the year music quiz. Game of the year has got to go the marble game. Very simple, similar to musical chairs, however, a marble and the last person to grab a marble gets taken away after each round. It got competitive!! In between the games Daddy did his customary BBQ'ed pork! Good fun had by all, even Nigel who was supposed to go out with his mates.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_12_17-08-ChristmasParty.jpg</src><caption>E'ster thinking "What Am I Doing Here"</caption></image>

    <title>Christmas Eve</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had Joey and Lily to stay overnight so we played with them in the morning until Auntie Ellie came to pick them up and take them home. We had to do jobs during the day including getting the motorbike and computer fixed! For the first time in ages Daddy didn't have to go to work on Christmas Eve so we were able to go over to the Fars a little earlier than usual, 3pm. We started playing games wanting to make a mess! Auntie Susan and Graham came over as well. We tucked in to the traditional Roast Pork, although we stuck to the usual sausages. We're not got into the Danish Chrsitmas food yet. It was scrummy. Farfar won the risemange prize!</p><p>We then played the dice game which is similar to the chinese auction other than you have to roll a 6, rather than get your card called out.</p><p>6:15 and it was 'present time'. The first lot for this Christmas. It seems to be getting more and more liberal each year now. Rather than open one present at a time, there is a lot going on. Katie got a hooded top, Ben got Domino Rally and Jessica got a hat and glove set. It was nice the children are a year older therefore we adults could enjoy ourselves a little more without having to worry about high chairs, nappies and feeding the children. It was really nice to see Katie chatting away to Auntie Susan and Ben boring the pants off Graham about Star Wars. That boy must have been going on for about 30 minutes without much pause for breath!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_12_24-23-ChristmasEve.jpg</src><caption>Present time at the Fars</caption></image>

    <title>Christmas Day</title>
    <info>
		<p>We awoke at 5:45am, having had a poor nights sleep as we saw that Father Christmas had arrived sometime during the night and was to excited to sleep properly. Mummy and Daddy capitulated to the pressure and got up and started opening presents at 6am! First into Jessica and Ben's room where each of us had between 15 and 17 presents to open from the Red Man. Highlight presents:</p><p>Ben's Presents</p><ul><li>An Imaginex Rocket</li><li>Lego</li><li>Man United Scooter</li><li>Beast Quest annual</li></ul><p>Katie's Presents:</p><ul><li>Barbie House</li><li>MP3 player</li><li>Reading Light</li><li>Cool Kards</li><li>Repunzal Barbie Doll</li></ul><p>Jessica's Presents:</p><ul><li>Scooter</li><li>Kitchen</li><li>Horrid Henry Annual</li></ul><p>Katie was the most excited and happy with her haul, followed closely by Ben. Jessica reacted similar to the others at the age of 4, a little grumpy and overwhelmed by it all we think and hope. Still she will get out of that stage next Christmas I hope. She did not get a dolly with a dummy, which she was upset about, although she owns about a million dollies and dummies!</p><p>We moved into Mummy and Daddy's bedroom and they opened their presents. Mummy got: Kath Kitson Welly Boots, Next Jeans, 1881 perfume. Daddy got: Two Adidas T-Shirts, Bobby Robson auto biography and a smart grey shirt.</p><p>To the third tranche, the present from friends under the tree. The Sanders were embarrassingly generous again. Jessica got a V-Tech computer, Katie a lovely boots and jumper, Ben a Star Wars lego set. A good haul.</p><p>We popped over to the Fars for a danish breakfast and to finish off opening some more presents, whilst Mummy went to church. We saw Auntie Susan who came over for the guinea fowl Christmas Lunch. We moved onto Ma Ma and Pop Pop's around midday.</p><p>A tinkering in the format this year again a little more. Basically all the kids stuff will be done first, then after the children have gone to bed it was time for the adults to eat their meal and open presents.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_12_25-00-ChristmasDayWestons.jpg</src><caption>Christmas at Ma Ma and Pop Pop's</caption></image>

    <title>Boxing Day at the Elders</title>
    <info>
		<p>We awoke in our various bedroom with Lily giving us a lovely, switch the lights on and saying "Time To Get Up"! Fortunately it was not too early. We played some more of our games and tried to tidy a little before leaving Ma Ma's and returning through the traffic back home!</p><p>Later in the afternoon we travelled to Alton for the Elders Boxing Day Bash with the Barnett side of the family. A traditional event now with the familiar format of games, auction, buffet and having a laugh. This year Katie was allowed to stay up with the adults and join in with the games.</p><p>Ben and Joey got on very well again. They're good little mates.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_12_26-43-BoxingDayElders.jpg</src><caption>Katie playing Give Us A Clue</caption></image>

    <title>Kayaking: Sonning to Shiplake</title>
    <info>
		<p>We spent a day in playing with all our toys and games from Christmas. Meanwhile the Fars came over to pick Daddy up and took him Kayaking. The trip up to London for the next leg was a little too far, so decided to attack the western side of the Thames. Perhaps Daddy's challenge can be extended from Reading to Gravesend now. A few miles east of Reading is the picturesque village of Sonning. Daddy set off from here downstream. It was very peaceful and the weather quite mild. Daddy just wore a pair of shorts! The Fars went for a cross country drive around the surrounding area and met up at Shiplake Lock where they met up and had a cup of coffee. Next step was to navigate around the lock without the lock keeper noticing as Daddy does not have a license to paddle on the Thames. First attempt was met by a home owner who shoed Daddy off as he was trespassing. Instead, he went across the other side of the river, dragged his boat across the mini island which the lock keeper's house was on and got back on the water. A final mile stretch to Shiplake (just south of Henley) ended this peaceful and enjoyable trip. There are some right posh drums backing on to the river in this neck of the woods.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2011/2011_12_27-01-SonningKayak.jpg</src><caption>Sonning Bridge</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 25: River Orwell Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>We headed to Suffolk for the next of our Walks. The furthest one from our house, so decided to stay overnight at a Travelodge as well! We got to Pin Mill in good time, about 2:30 hours. We parked up, put our boots and gloves on and made our way along the Orwell. Mummy decided we should do the extended walk which took us on a record breaking 5.6 miles circuit around Woolverstone and Chelmondiston. Us children survived quite well not moaning really at all.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_01_02-04-OrwellWalk.jpg</src><caption>Katie edging the Orwell</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_01_02-48-OrwellWalk.jpg</src><caption>Ben through the puddles</caption></image><p>We celebrated the walk with a trip to Pizza Hut and made our way back into Capel St Mary for a little play on the swings before an early bed time.</p><p>We got up the day after at 5:45am so we could get Daddy to work for a 9am start.</p>

    <title>Birthday Party, Swimming</title>
    <info>
		<p>A bits and pieces day. Ben had football which Mummy and the Fars went to see. Daddy stayed home with the girls and lost 4 games of 'Teego' or 'Stratego'. We then went to get Daddy's motorbike fixed, and looked at some new sofas in Farnham. Next we rushed over to the Old Dean to drop Mummy and Jessica off at Lily's birthday party. Meanwhile the 'crocodile' and two bits of meat went swimming at the Arena. Ben's swimming has really come on. He can swim the length of the baby pool, a bit of a struggle, but still he's come on so much since moving swimming lessons.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_01_07-06-Family.jpg</src><caption>Jessica playing 'Teego'</caption></image>

		<p>After church  we went up to London and started off at Hyde Park near the Italian fountains. We took our scooters and caught the tube from Lancaster gate to Notting Hill Gate where the walk officially starts.</p><p>The first half of the walk was down Portabello Road. Daddy made us go slowly as he went in record and shoe shops! We also went in the occasional tourist boutique.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_01_08-24-PaddingtonWalk.jpg</src><caption>Portabello Road</caption></image><p>The second half of the walk was along the Grand Union canal. We stopped off at Trellick Towers playground and a cool skate park at Westbourne Terrace. We scooted past Little Venice and into Paddington Station. We couldn't find the Paddington Bear statue unfortunately. A good walk.</p>

		<p>A busy day, first up was ballet where Jessica was taken Daddy who waited in a cramped waiting area. It was the coldest day of the winter so far. Daddy managed to peek through and watch Jessica with a smile on her face constantly attempting to follow the leader, sometimes slipping onto the floor and getting back up laughing. Daddy was very proud of watching his happy little girl.</p><p>Next up was a quick excursion to the Fars, then a trip for all of us to see Hart Jets versus Frimley Green Cheetahs. The Sanders came over to watch Ben play 20 minutes in a ding dong game which ended in a 4-4 draw.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_01_14-01-FrimleyGreenVHartJets.jpg</src><caption>Ben on the subs bench</caption></image><p>Farnborough shopping next to buy a sofa and a new router! £1200 lighter in the wallet.</p><p>The afternoon was spent at a couple of birthday parties, one at Tonlinscote with Jessica, the other Leah Sumners at Cross Farm School.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_01_14-19-AvaBirthdayParty.jpg</src><caption>Jessica and her best friend Amy Huggets</caption></image><p>The Elders came around in the evening for some playtime.

    <title>3 Parties at 3pm</title>
    <info>
		<p>Another busy Saturday, first up Jessica to ballet, then Ben to football which was a bit of a mission. He needed some encouragement as his confidence was running a little low. Returning home, Daddy had to help Katie out with her 'Chunk Division' homework as Mummy hadn't a clue. This actually this was a bit unfair as Katie could do it without Daddy's help really. Just need to work on the addition and subtraction of small numbers. Daddy expects Katie to answer quickly, rather than using her fingers to calculate.</p><p>In the afternoon we had three concurrent parties. Jessica was at the lavish Jermimah's house, Ben went to Jake's football party, and Katie was lucky enough to go to Leah Rushforth's party which was a trip to the Polka Theatre, Wimbledon to see the Charlotte's Web production. They are a great family always hosting and putting on great events. Daddy thinks they're wonderful.</p><p>We had a treat and went to the fish and chip shop for tea.</p>

    <title>Hampton Court Palace Bike Ride</title>
    <info>
		<p>Church and work in the morning as usual. It was quite a chilly day, this week we braved going for our bike ride starting off at Hampton Court Palace. We were impressed with 'toparied' gardens. Unfortunately Daddy still has not fixed Katie's bike which meant her pedal kept coming off. Still we had lots of freedom and didn't need to worry about Ben continually falling off his bike. We're not sure what he's doing half the time, he seems a little out of control and therefore constantly fighting the bike to stay upright. Is he drunk? We made our way out of one of the gates into Home Park which led us past the deer and playing logs up to Kingston bridge. </p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_01_22-06-HamptonCourtBikeRide.jpg</src><caption>Formal Gardens, Hampton Court Palace</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_01_22-20-HamptonCourtBikeRide.jpg</src><caption>The gang in Home Park, Hampton Court</caption></image>

    <title>Duke Meet</title>
    <info>
		<p>After taking Jessica to ballet and picking up Daddy's perscription we headed west to Gloustershire to see Auntie Charlotte, Luke and of course the new Duke. Duke being a new addition to the family, a Staffordshire Pit Bull puppy. We were all pretty anxious about how sharp it's teeth might be.</p><p>Ben was the first to brave going in the garden to see him. Duke lept up at Ben, but Ben stood his ground although pretty nervous. Ben also ran away from him a couple of times being a bit scared. However, Duke was well behaved and only caught Ben the once with a scratch.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_01_28-02-DukeMeet.jpg</src><caption>Ben meet Duke</caption></image><p>Eventually the rest of us were integrated to Duke gradually and he came into the huse. Katie and Jessica were still quite nervous of him and managed to just about stroke him. We are a funny lot really being scared of a puppy.</p><p>After some lunch we went to the park by the Cheltenham Pump Rooms so we all could have a run around. Having a young puppy really turns you into a mecca for other gossiping dog owners. We walked around the huge lake and played on the swings and went on the adventure trails.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_01_28-27-DukeMeet.jpg</src><caption>Ben meet Duke</caption></image><p>Returning to Charlotte and Luke's house we were graced with the Elder's presence who were visitng friends locally. We stopped off for pizzas before a petrol hungry journey home!</p><p>By the end of the day we all had a go at feeding Duke from our hand, a big step up from where we were at the start of the day. </p>

		<p>In the morning we went off to church as usual. As we were not able to make Joey's midweek birthday party we went to the Monkey pool in Woking to celebrate. Katie dared to go on the super fast slide all by her slef. We also managed to workout that if you stretched your arms behind you, then you slide quicker. We ended with a drink and some birthday cake in the cafe.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_01_29-08-JoeyWokingSwim.jpg</src><caption>Katie sharing her Slush Puppy with Joey</caption></image><p>Meanwhile, Jessica had her best friends party, Amee Huggets, down at Tomlinscote school which Mummy walked her to.</p><p>Later in the afternoon, Daddy returned to work, whilst the rest of us went to the church party.

    <title>Daddy only!</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy went off to her cousin Kerry's Hen Night last night and didn't return until Sunday. Therefore we had the Dark Side Daddy to look after us and threatened to send us to bed at 5:30pm. Well first off we all played rough and tumble in bed for 45 minutes in the morning. Daddy tried to trap us. We eventualy got up and took Jessica to her ballet lesson. Whilst Jessica was again smiling and laughing in her lesson, Katie beat us at a game of Whist! There was an announcement being made so Daddy rushed out of the kitchen into the main hall way, as Ben followed he pushed his way through, pushing so much he made Daddy lose his balance and make a right old racket in trying to avoid little baby Lucy. He eventually fell out of the fire escape doors! He never did find out what the announcement was.</p><p>We went off to the shops to get some hot dog sausages which we had for lunch and of course some sweeties. Ben felt a little unwell when we returned home. I think he was the next in line to contract 'Slapped Cheek' which has being doing the rounds. Anyway we snuggled him up to bed for a little sleep. Katie and Jessica made him little 'Get Well Soon' pictures. Very sweet.</p><p>The first part of the afternoon was spent doing homework. Katie had to make a map and plot co-ordinates as well as reading. Ben had reading and sentences to write. I am still trying to get Jessica to consistently count to 20. This is proving a hard task. She misses out seven, then gets stuck at thirteen. Frustrating. Later we went to Aldershot Ski for Adam's birthday party. We went snow tubing down the ski slope. Daddy and Jessica managed to go down as well, which was a surprise as we thought it might be a bit too fast for Jessica to go down. At the end just the four of us had a race down. Katie won!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_02_04-01-Snow.jpg</src><caption>Katie on the slide</caption></image><p>Funnily enough as we left the ski slope it started snowing for the first time this winter. Woo Hoo. We quickly popped in to see the West's and drop Freya's birthday present off. However, only Barrie was at home. We had a drink and a play with the Star Wars figures before returning home.</p><p>Daddy missed his 5:30pm by a couple of hours. We still had time for some stories.</p><p>Meanwhile Mummy went to Colchester with her mum and sisters for a spa day then a trip on the party bus down to London, then onto the party boat, then back up to Colchester. All we heard about was the amazing party bus and the lack of food. This spelt trouble in terms of alcohol! The journey was a little frought with the snow blizzard conditions. The party bus tried to drop off 15 half cut women 7 miles short at 2am in the morning! Erm NO. They eventually got home but it was snowing hard.</p>

    <title>Fars and Mummy returns</title>

		<p>We awoke to loads of snow. So much that it had weighed down the bush at the side of house and made it fall over the path. Another job for Daddy to get on with.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_02_05-02-Fars.jpg</src><caption>Woods Snowy Walk</caption></image><p>We wrapped up warm got the wooden sleigh out and treked through the woods to Richmond Close. It was tough pulling two children up the hills. The snow was fast thawing making out heads all wet and cold.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_02_05-03-Fars.jpg</src><caption>The cattle feeding</caption></image><p>We had breakfast at the Fars, played with the electric train set and completed the treasure hunt the fars set us. We made some hamma bead mats which we were going to give to Mummy as a welcome home present. Fortunately Farfar gave us a lift back home. The roads were not that bad.</p><p>We went off to Farnham to collect Mummy who eventually returned! We had a relaxing afternoon, making a snowman and clearing up!</p>

		<p>We fortunately went to Jessica's ballet as this week they let parents come in and watch. It was one of the funniest things ever as a parent. Jessica was constantly smiling and showing off her skills, always looking over to make sure we were watching her. She was brilliant</p><p>In the afternoon Katie went over to Poppy's for a play and a sleepover. Auntie Charlotte took Ben to the circus in Basingstoke which was fantastic.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_02_11-13-JessicaBallet.jpg</src><caption>Jessica's ballet</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 27: Richmond Thames Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Mummy went to church, she was on sidesmans duties. Katie and Ben was being looked after by a sleeping Daddy. After a quick lunch we left at midday for the next walk out of the book: Richmond Marshes. Both Mummy and Daddy were sporting their new walking boots, although 99% of the walk was on gravel or tarmac!</p><p>We started off at Richmond station in the town centre and quickly moved towards the river past some nice looking parks and buildings, through Richmond palace and onto the river. It was a pretty chilly, but bright day. There were plenty of others walking along the Thames. Daddy had not been well for most of the week, and was starting to feel effects. However, we marched on and hit the midpoint at the river boat crossing by Ham House. We crossed and went on the swings on the north side of the river.</p><p>We went passed the impressive looking Marble House on our return leg, went on some more swings, back over Richmond bridge and to the car.</p><p></p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_02_19-34-RichmondWalk.jpg</src><caption>Petersham Wall</caption></image>

		<p>Daddy's boss, Paul Matthews got the sack yesterday which was very sad. He hates it when that kind of thing happens.</p><p>Jessica was preparing for her ballet exam next month. Ben came on as sub for his football team against Rushmoor in a 2-2 draw. The sofas also arrived which excited Mummy very much, but Daddy not so much as he spent the day deconstructing and dumping the old sofas!</p><p>In the evening Ellie and Lily came over and babysay us whilst Mummy and Daddy went to Berkhamsted Centenary Hall to see David perform in Strictly Learn Dancing. He did ever so well dancing both the Waltz and the Jive. They sat next to Linda and Alan which was nice so they could catch up.

    <title>Walk 28: Festival Of Britain</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the next installment of our walks book we drove up to Lambeth and began our trek by the extermely busy London Eye and walked along South Bank, stopping to watch some of the entertainers. There were more acts than ever before. The whole park area was being improved so was fenced off to us which was a shame. We had a hug with the Queen, watched a magic man and some street dancing.</p><p>It was a glorious sunny day, good for a stroll. We moved on passed Festival Hall and to the skate park which was good for us as we all had our scooters with us. We were mixing it with the cool dudes. A boy tried to teach us how to go down the steep banks. However, we were a bit unsure and not confident enough to follow his lead. Daddy and Katie told the rest of us how they had lunch on 'Katie Island' which we saw out on the river between Waterloo and the Jubilee bridges. We were rather tired of hearing about it after a while!</p><p>We were stopped off by a few students who were doing a Tv piece for their university project. They asked a few questions to Mummy about her first ever kiss. She agreed but was very embarrassed and nervous. Still it made Daddy laugh.</p><p>We continued and stopped off at Gabrielle's Wharf for a little play on the wooden animals before passing the music man come sand sculturer. Jessica was the only person to manage to throw the money into the buckets on the small beach! We skirted the Tate Modern and crossed the wibbly-wobbly bridge before hitting the end point of St Paul's cathedral.</p><p>By this point we were all flagging a little and kind of not caring about St Paul's, which was a shame. We found a food shop and shoved a load of sweets, chocolates and crisps down our throats. We walked all the way back to the car in Lambeth and drove home. It takes about 1.25 / 1.5 hours to commute to London for us lot which is not too bad.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_02_26-00-SouthBank.jpg</src><caption>Let's Entertain You</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_02_26-29-SouthBank.jpg</src><caption>Angelic Jecmunda</caption></image>

		<p>We headed Kent bound for Alices 5th birthday party. The car was not feeling too good so we were a bit worried if we going to make it or not. Alas we arrived albeit 10 minutes late at Monkey Biz, a soft play. Daddy came in to eat us all up and did actually catch us sometimes.</p><p>It was nice to see the Teale's. Karen is working hard a mum and working 5 days a week in London. The girl must be tired out.</p><p>Jessica had sausage and chips, we sang happy birthday. A nice time had by all.</p><p>Later in the afternoon Jessica had a final practice for her ballet exam. We also went over to the Army swings and popped into see Farmor.</p><object width="560" height="315"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Dl2Rvi13vWw?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Dl2Rvi13vWw?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="560" height="315" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

    <title>Natasha 4th birthday party, Dilley meet</title>
    <info>
		<p>We missed church, instead going to Natasha Burrows 4th birthday party held in the leisure centre in Redhill. As Katie and Ben were not really invited Daddy took them for a swim. Ben put so much effort into his 20 metre swim. The longest he's ever swum. They also went in the deep end and tried to sink to the bottom of the pool. Ben found this difficult as he was too bouyent.</p><p>It poured down outside and it even turned to sleet on occassions. We next stopped off at the Elders in Alton to meet their new dog, Dilley for the first time. The girls were not brave enough to go beyound the stair gate at first, but it was Dilley who was more nervous of the Gay's. A sweet doggy which was doted upon by the male Elders.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_03_04-03-Natashas3rdBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Musical Bumps</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_03_04-07-DilleyMeet.jpg</src><caption>Doggy Dilley</caption></image>

		<p>Jessie had ballet in the morning, then we split. Mummy, like last year, agreed to collect for Marie Curie in memory of her Grandad. So we dropped her off at Longacre garden centre. The rest of us went to Crookham Memorial Hall for Joshua's first birthday party.</p><p>There were loads of toys set out for us to play with. Joey and Lily came along too which was nice.</p><p>After the party we returned to pick Mummy up in her funny costume.</p><p>Ben was really looking forward to the afternoon as he went on his first Beaver camp held just at the scout hut in Frimley Green. He took some old clothes which he cut up for his castaway outfit. They had a map and had to do a treasure hunt. He stayed over night, which we were a little worried about just in case he wet himself. We sent him off with two sleeping bags just in case.</p><p>Pop Pop, popped over for a quick cup of tea.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_03_10-06-Joshua1stBirthday.jpg</src><caption>The young'uns crew</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_03_10-19-Joshua1stBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Mummy The Marie Curie Girl</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 29 - Mother's Day - 101 Dalmations Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ben woke daddy up at 5:45 informing him he had to get up and help make Mummy's breakfast in bed and to put the meat on for a Sunday lunch! Great. Well Mummy certainly got some nice home made gifts. After a double church service. </p><p>In the afternoon we drove up to London, parked right by Regents Park and started our 3 mile walk. First was the house where the 101 Dalmations lived. That was the first and last reference to those muts!</p><p>Although we have been to Regents Park before, it was a while ago and we explored different areas this time. We traversed our way through, visiting the lake, rose garden, an island where we played 'it' and walked across the Regent's Canal right next to London Zoo. We got to Primrose Hill and climbed to the top, well Jessica was of course pushed there, the lazy madam. Good views over London. </p><p>We ended the walk going through the high street in Primrose Hill then over the railway bridge to Chalk Farm.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_03_18-35-RegentsParkWalk.jpg</src><caption>Katie with wooden animals in Regents Park</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_03_18-44-RegentsParkWalk.jpg</src><caption>Beaut Ben</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_03_18-46-RegentsParkWalk.jpg</src><caption>Jessica on the run down Primrose Hill</caption></image>

    <title>Football, Over to Auntie Ellie's</title>
    <info>
		<p>Over the past two weeks we had both Katie and Ben's parents evening. The reports were that Ben is very enthusiastic in class and inquisitive enough to ask questions. Excels in Maths, but is a little sloppy on quality in terms of rushing things. Not because he is lazy, but because he wants to get on to the next thing. He's basically doing very well and we couldn't ask for more from him. Katie on the other hand.... no Katie is also doing well. Having Mrs Farage as a teacher has made such a difference as Katie loves her. As such she is progressing so much better than she was last year. All round she is a lot more confident in class. She is doing well in reading.</p><p>To this weekend. Daddy was away (see Sunday's account). Ben had football in the morning which the team lost 2-0. Again he played about half the match, watching the ball go past him mostly. Harsh but true.</p><p>In the afternoon we went over to Auntie Ellie's to stay the night. we played with Joey and Lily as usual. However, we were very, very naughty. We finished dinner early and asked to go out and play. We were told only to play on the grass at the back of the house, instead we went across two roads to the playground. After a bit, Mummy and Auntie Ellie could not find us. After 20 minute they had called the police. Fortunately before they came out we found them again and gave them a good telling off. Ben and Katie were very sorry.</p>

    <title>Airsoft Weekend</title>
    <info>
		<p>I, Daddy, spent the weekend away with Michael and a group called the Madhatters who are an Airsoft team. For the uninitiated Airsoft is like paintball on steroids. Ball bearings are the bullets, but there is also grenades of various sorts (stun, smoke, frag), tracer or glow in the dark ball bearings, competitors with 3rd generation night vision which cost into the thousands of pounds. There are various weapons from pistols, sniper rifles and the million variants of machine gun. There were lots of other 'pyros' which were exploded to signify air strikes and mortar fire all of which were very loud, especially when you are in a building which bounces the sound.</p><p>Anyway I prepared in customary style. He had no kit, no gun, no ammo, no place to sleep, little food and no idea on the rules of the game, even that it was a 24 hour non-stop game! Instead, rolling up on the motorbike with a sleeping bad half falling out of the top box. 'You are joking!!' Thankfully Michael and the Madhatters provided the rest. First night, Friday, was spent in the tent on uncomfortable ground. Having being told to man-up and not bring two sleeping bags and balaclava, Michael had two of everything and an airbed! Last time I'll listen to that advice!!</p><p>Over 300 competitors, 80 odd buildings at Copehill, Salisbury plain, a military training location. The shouty, swear mongering sergent major figure outlining the rules at the equivilent of the FA Cup final event, barked out if everyone had done Airsofting before. Clearly everyone had... other than Myself and Michael, but we were no way going to admit that. We started at 11am as reserves, clearing houses where enemy stragglers were situated. In our Madhatters section there were seven of us, lead by Rich. To begin with communications were good. The platoon leader would give, Rich orders and he'd relay them on and we all stuck together. Nearer the end it was a case of get together if you can. Still it did not ruin the experience. Some other teams were like well oiled machines. The 'Tigers' section were the in-house, home team. It was a slick operation watching them perform house clearences.</p><p>After our initial task, we got bogged down in a group of 4 houses in a fire fight on the front line for about 3 hours. One of the idiosyncrasies of us fighting men was to stop for tea break back at the campsite. We had the finest leaf tea money could buy served with the china tea set that Alex had bought for 25 pounds! We all agreed it was a spiffing brew and decided to go and give the hun a jolly good boff on head for not playing with a straight bat!!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_03_25-02-AirsoftWithTheMadhatters.jpg</src><caption>Daddy in the army</caption></image><p>After a slow start with the gun, I managed to kind of get hang of it. By the end of the game I was getting frustrated at how quick the ammo was going I was firing so much. After the tea break we had lost a lot of ground and so a new environment and set of problems to overcome. As night fell we were tasked to defend the ammo compound. Not one of us fired a weapon for about an hour. Humiliatingly one of the 'tans' (the opposition) walked up to our building said 'how are you?', to which we replied, then he shot me with a pistol from close range and knife killed Brett and then took our 'intel'. Our excuse was that we couldn't tell in the dark which side he was on, the truth was, we were embarrassingly caught off guard. It was pitch black in the building, but some of the enemy had "night vision", effectively being able to see in the dark! I couldn't even see to the end of the room I was in. To add to this was the fact that most competitors had tracer rounds and I did not, so even if I did shoot I would not be able to see where I was aiming at. These disadvantages and a cracking headache I decided to make use of Michal's airbed and turn in early with the thought of getting up at first light.</p><p>At 5:45 I got up, scraped the frost from my gun and kit and went into battle leaving others in bed. I felt very refreshed and got a second wind of enthusiasm. It all seemed to click in to place now. Movement, tactics, gun usage. I had a lot of fun. My highlight was being the last survisor on the top flight of Bangalore School. I had enemy firing at me from all angles. No one else in the building. My allies all on one side of the building firing at the enemy on the other side of the building. I killed two by just reaching out of the window and firing below me. It was such a buzz. Alas I ran out of ammo and had to go back and re-stock.</p><p>The game ended 11am on the Sunday morning, a full 23 hours, with the clocks moving forward. I wanted more, but my feet did not! We lost narrowly and after the results, a debrief and packing up the tents we all parted ways back to civilazation. A cracking weekend.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_03_25-AirsoftWithTheMadhatters.jpg</src><caption>Airsoft, Section 3, aka The Madhatters</caption></image>

    <title>Day 1 - Katie's New Barn School Trip</title>
    <info>
		<p>We got to school, did the register and lined up with a partner. My partner was Catilin who I sat next to on the coach down to Dorset. When we got there we had our packed lunch and had a tour around the site at New Barn. We explored the barn, the quiet area and the playground.</p><p>Then we got to know who we slept with. I was sleeping on the top bunk in the Hayloft and Caitlin slept below on Wednesday night and Megan on the Thursday. Others in my dormitory were: Phoebe, Mezlie, Tolu, Natasha, Georgia, Megan, Poppy and Caitlin. The activity we did first was orienteering and I partnered with Nina. We had to find all the places marked on the map. We then went back to our dormitories and we were a bit smelly so we had a shower. Then we went to have our dinner in the cafe which was chips, chicken nuggets and baked beans. For pudding we had ice cream with kind of bread around it. Then we went back to our dormitory, got into our pyjamas and chatted for a bit. Our leader, Mrs G, read us the story, The Grufalo, and another story called 'Ridiculous'. She then gave us a glowstick each. We took about 5 minutes to get into bed and another 5 minutes to fall fast asleep.</p>

    <title>Day 2 - Katie's New Barn School Trip</title>
    <info>
		<p>I was the first one to wake up in the morning. We got dressed and went to the cafe to have our breakfast which was Frosties and an apple and you could have a yoghurt, but I didn't because they had bits in it. We went back to our dormitory to chill out for a bit. I was in group B which meant I played in the playground. Me Caitlin played horses for an hour. After that we made pottery. I made a duck pond with ducks and a snake in the middle. Then Mrs G then had a turn on the potters wheel and made a vase which turned out quite good. Next up was lunch which comprised of a packet of salt and vinegar crisps, a ham sandwich, and two apples. I had apple juice to wash it all down.</p><p>After that we went to the 'Living History' part and went in lots of roundhouses. We made flour and butter.</p><p>After our roast dinner we went into the barn and had a pirate party. We danced the Conga and played a game of musical statues which I came joint first in. We went back to our dormitories and had another story read to us and were given glowsticks to help us in the night.</p>

    <title>Day 3 - Katie's New Barn School Trip</title>
    <info>
		<p>I was the first to wake up again. We then got dressed and went back to the cafe for breakfast. For breakfast I had toast which was made from the flour and butter that we produced yesterday. It was yummy. We had a little chat about what we could buy for our family. I bought a clay cobra for Ben, a penguin made from clay for Jessica, for Daddy I got a New Barn cup and for Mummy I got a teddy key ring.</p><p>We returned back to the dormitory and brushed our teeth. Our next activity was making a Celtic Roundhouse out of straw and wood. It was complicated and took us a very long time but it turned out well-ish.</p><p>Then we had lunch and I had the same thing as yesterday. We then back to our dormitories and played board games with the teachers. I came second in Snakes and Ladders and won Frustration. After games we went to see the animals and saw a baby lamb being born.</p><p>We packed our stuff together ready for going home. We had our lunch, the same as the day before and began our journey home. We stopped off at Maiden Castle which was an Iron Age hill fort. We had to walk a mile long! It was good as we could see for about 20 miles.</p><p>We got back on the coach and returned back to school at about 4:30. Mummy was so excited to meet me, she was jumping up and down. Overall I had a brilliant time and loved it.</p>

		<p>We churched in the morning as usual. After Sunday lunch the girls went to church for the Baptism party, whilst the boys enjoyed a leisurely stroll down the Thames in the Kayak. They started in Old Windsor and paddled to the swings at Runymede where they stopped for a play. Ben was helpful as ever in the boat. They returned back to the car in quick time. They chatted all the way back about World War II and the computer game, Civilization III.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_04_01-16-ThamesRunnymedeKayak.jpg</src><caption>Alternative paddling style</caption></image>

It has been a delight to have Summer over she is very well behaved and plays very well with Katie. They are good friends.</p><p>In the afternoon we went over to Reigate where we met up with Karen and Alice. We went on the excellent playground. It was a very sunny day. After spending a couple of hours there, we climbed up Reigate hill where we went exploring down the bottom of the hill.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_04_06-02-ReigatePark.jpg</src><caption>Mummy chatting away to Karen</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 30 - Tower Hill to Canary Wharf Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>We started at a reasonable time on Saturday morning and travelled through London and parked up by Tower Hill. Before starting the walk we went to an excellent playground just by the tube station. There were funny springy aparatus and a fast roundabout which Daddy spun us off! After the obligatory toilet trips we ventured down to St Katherines dock where we passed all the posh yachts.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_04_07-01-WappingLimehouseWalk.jpg</src><caption>To the tower</caption></image><p>We largely followed the Thames path and soon passed the steps where Daddy and Katie ended the London kayak expedition back last year. Mummy was getting fed up listening to this constant story! We soon stopped for lunch overlooking Tower Bridge. Ben scooted along as we headed upon virgin territory, well for us anyway. Wapping, the home of the newspapers, had many luxury flats overlooking the river. So close to the hustle and bustle of Tower Hill and the City, however, very quiet. Hardly any traffic and the occassional jogger and dog walker. We stopped at a playground and continued along our 5 mile journey, eventually reaching the financial district. We reached Cabbot Square and West India Dock where we ended our walk, one which the children seemed to enjoy, or at least they've got used to the routine now!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_04_07-24-WappingLimehouseWalk.jpg</src><caption>Tower Bridge</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_04_07-46-WappingLimehouseWalk.jpg</src><caption>Daddy with the crew at West India dock</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_04_07-51-WappingLimehouseWalk.jpg</src><caption>Lovers</caption></image><p>We caught the Docklands Light Railway ad Tube back to the car and made home via the weekly food shop at Shannons Corner.</p>

    <title>Sanders Over For Lunch, Milly Molly returns</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ben played football next to the Arena in Camberley and done quite well this week. He got a shot off at goal which was marvellous. However, he took a smack to the face which at first it looked if he had absorbed, but 5 seconds later he began to feel the affects and balled out crying. He was substituted, which was a shame as I say as he played very well.</p><p>When Ben and Daddy returned the Sanders had just turned up for a feast of Gay entertainment. Evie met the hamster, Milly Molly who was on her two week vacation here much to our delight, but not quite Daddy's. In the two weeks she has kept us awake by going on her wheel during the night, poo'ed over the carpet and generally we've found hamster food all over the house. Ben got his revenge by painting nail varnish on it yesterday!</p><p>After lunch we went to the Garden Of Eden swings where Daddy set out an obsticle course. Ben and Katie went around and around trying to beat each others time. Even each of the adults had a go. On the way back we stopped off at the Royal Logistics Museum which had a Jeep and a Land Rover which we played in for quite a time. An ex-army now policeman turned up and spoke about his experiences in the Land Rover when he was stationed in Northern Ireland. It sounded pretty scary stuff.</p><p>Later in the afternoon Ma Ma and Pop Pop popped around to take Milly Molly away.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_04_14-04-Sanders.jpg</src><caption>Jam Sandwiches</caption></image>

    <title>Over To The Burrows For Lunch</title>
    <info>
		<p>As there was no Sunday School we stayed at home with Daddy playing and getting the bikes ready for later in the afternoon. After Mummy returned from church we sped off to Kenley and to the Burrows household. It was the first time in a while since Daddy had seen the house after it had been done up. He liked it very much from the white theme to the period architecture. Anyway Ben and Thomas got on like a house on fire. We had a BBQ with some really nice food.</p><p>We invaded the home of Fiona's sister and then all moved on to Kenley Aerodrone where it was very windy. Daddy took a foam plane which he threw for the first time and hit Jo on the back of the head. Whoops. Meanwhile Ben had wandered off on his bike half way around the aerodrome, so Daddy raced off to find him on Katie's bike. There wasn't much time for anything else. Mummy and Jessica sheltered in the car waiting for the rest of us to finish up.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_04_15-02-Burrows.jpg</src><caption>Lounging around</caption></image>

    <title>Katie's Sleepovers, Swimming, Kerry's Wedding</title>

		<p>Katie had been on two sleepovers. The first on Thursday night was with Brownies and last night she had a fun evening at the Sanders, going for McDonalds and bowling.</p><p>Daddy and Ben went off to collect Katie and them headed straight to Headley for a 9am kickoff. Ben got a couple attempts at goal this week, which was very satisfying.</p><p>After lunch we went to Farnborough for a swim. It's been a while since we've been. We dashed home to find Charlotte and Farmor waiting for us. Farmor took us in the car to Chertsey to pick Farfar up from football. Steve Powers told us that Daddy used to be a pickle which we found ammusing. After our Fish and Chips we did a twilight Treasure Hunt, then when it got too dark we went back to watch the original Italian Job.</p><p>Meanwhile Daddy, Mummy and Auntie Charlotte went all the way to a Barn outside Colchester for a proper Essex wedding party. Mummy's cousin, Kerry married 2 weeks previous in Cuba and this was the home leg as it were. It was real nice to see that side of the family again. Mummy and Auntie Ellie did a lot of dancing. Daddy feasted on the hogg roast! A 1:30am return.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_04_21-50-KerrySimonWeddingParty.jpg</src><caption>Mummy and Daddy on there way out</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_04_21-25-KerrySimonWeddingParty.jpg</src><caption>Christine, Gerry and Heather</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_04_21-16-KerrySimonWeddingParty.jpg</src><caption>Showing us the married moves</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_04_21-30-KerrySimonWeddingParty.jpg</src><caption>More phone girls than party girls</caption></image>

    <title>Canal and River Trek to London on the Bike</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy and Auntie Susan decided they would bike from our house going along the canal and river to central London! Madness. It was pretty cold and there were a few drops of rain in the air, however, they soildered off along the roads to Knaphill where they joined the Basingstoke Canal. From there they headed north east and joined the River Wey right by the M25. A muddy path led to Weybridge and a short trip on the roads made them join up with the Thames.</p><p>Farfar waited by the burger van at Walton bridge egging them to have an all day breakfast. After his recent find of having heart trouble we thought it best to steer him away from this. We had a cup of tea and then off again up towards Hampton Court where they rode through Home Park and out to Kingston. It got a little muddy to the next town of Richmond. They again went by road up to Chiswick bridge and then joined the river again to Hammersmith and Putney. Riding on the north side of the river, they eventually hit Embankment and cycled past the busy Parliament Square, up Whitehall to Trafalgar Square where a big Vaisakhi festival was being held.</p><p>They had an entertaining walk past South Bank and all the street performers before catching a train ride to Ash Vale. A final 3 miles, made a total of about 45 miles on the day!</p><p>In the evening Joey and Lily came over to stay the night as Uncle Michael went to Thailand and Auntie Ellie worked.</p>

    <info>
		<p>In the morning we fitted a new tacky chiming doorbell and tested out our new one man tent.</p><p>We then drove to Cheltenham to celebrate Charlotte's 26th birthday with a BBQ along with the Elders and Steve, Joyce and Eva.

    <title>Day 1 - Kayaking Weekend</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy had originally arranged for 16 people to go to Ross On Wye this weekend to go camping and kayaking. To get there Mummy and Jessica took Daddy to the A34 / A303 junction where Jon and Rachel picked him up and took him the scenic route to Hoarwithy, the location of the first campsite. After dumping our kit we had to go and collect the Canadian canoe 10 miles away at Symonds Yat.</p><p>When we arrived we were presented with a slight problem as we were told the river was flowing too fast and were told to reconsider our plans. Apparently the resovoir upstream was full and the Environment Agency had opened a dam and released loads of water. Some canoe hire companies had cancelled all weekend bookings. You could see that the water level was a meter or so higher than usual. So we decided tomorrow we'd start from Hereford.</p><p>Other arrivals at the campsite were Pop Pop, Jon's brother Gerry, Charlotte, Howard and Susan. Everyone laughed at Daddy's very small one man tent! We had a BBQ and a camp fire. It got pretty cold during the night.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_17-09-RossOnWye.jpg</src><caption>Hoarwithy campsite and some very large tents!</caption></image>

    <title>Day 2 - Kayaking Weekend</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy awoke early to the sound of bird song and funny sounds emanating from the Weston tent!!! It was quite frosty as well which poses quite an issue in a compact tent. Anyway it was lovely to peer out of the tent to see swans elegantly landing in the River Wye next to us. We ferried the vessels and campers up to Hereford boat yard and met the Fars and the Elders.</p><p>Away we go. 28 miles to Ross On Wye. The river was flowing at a good pace but not enough we thought for the hire companies to cancel their bookings. The sun was blazing and weather just about perfect. Down the river we saw a mink which was very exciting. Midway through the first leg a number of parties stop off at a campsite for a coffee, leaving the other two boats to carry on. Shocking teamwork.</p><p>Daddy swapped to the Canadian Canoe for a bit which was interesting using a single paddle and kneeling down. We spotted Rachel and Michael who dotted themselves along our route. The Fars caught a glimpse of us from high up in the hills.</p><p>16 miles in and our first accident. Not realizing how close we were to our lunchtime meeting point, Ellie and Susan wanted top stop for a rest. Howard and Daddy attempted to assist in landing on the river bank. The boys rested against a pole in a fast flowing part of the river. The ladies then bumped into the boys canoe, capsizing them and spilling the contents into the river. The girls of course remained dry and Ellie had the audacity to video the aftermath rather than help get the boys and bags out of the river! Daddy's phone and diabetes gear was in the bag which was rescued under the water. Pheeww. We lost Susan's jumper however.</p><p>The 'coffee crew' caught up and we set sail once again for about half a mile to Hoarwithy campsite, our lunchtime destination. Landing here didn't go without incident either and poor old Howard went in the drink again. His partner, the honourable Susan Tilbury stood up in the boat, lost balance and made the Canadian canoe capsize for a second time in half an hour. Oh how we laughed. Howard wasn't too impressed at first, but quickly saw the funny side.</p><p>We ate our lunch..... Dilly eating other peoples lunches and prepared for our second stint. Personnel changes meant the laziest rower in the world, Mr Michael Elder, partnered Howard in the Canadian canoe. Ellie was with her Dad, Jon with brother Gerry and Daddy with 'Billy No Mates'. Boys will be boys and much of Daddy's trek involved playing silly buggers with Uncle Michael and Howard. This leg was quite hard but it was very tranquil and nice just to stop and suck in the fresh air.</p><p>At about 6pm we finally landed just past Ross On Wye by a pub in Wilton. The patch of grass between the pub and the river was our camp site. It was a glorious sunny evening. The stuck the tents up, went to the pub and have a lovely meal and a couple of sherberts. We hadn't realized how much sun we had all caught during the day. Most kayakers had a touch of sunburn. There were many tired bodies with the 28 mile trek from Hereford.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_17-17-RossOnWye.jpg</src><caption>Morning route</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_17-07-RossOnWye.jpg</src><caption>In the boat with Howard</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_17-18-RossOnWye.jpg</src><caption>Afternoon route</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_17-05-RossOnWye.jpg</src><caption>Our campsite.

    <title>Day 3 - Kayaking Weekend</title>
    <info>
		<p>Sun greeted us this morning. A tasty egg bap on the gas stove setup us nicely. Now the daring or stupid was about to happen. The 'lazy' rower along with the 'food snatcher', the 'two times dipper' and the 'titanic paddler' were boarding the most unstable vessel. Daddy was circling around like a shark waiting for it's prey to fall into the water. Michael with his weight issues sitting in the middle coupled with a nervous doggy made the canoe even more unstable. An abort request was made early on and Daddy in true 'Top Gear' type tradition laughed very hard at the panic and the remakable navigational skills of the oarsman in their desperation to find Michael and Dilly dry land. Eventually it happened half a mile down the river leaving a long walk back. Despite the idea of taking it easy, their were some serious efforts made to push the convoy along. Again Rachel and Michael were dotted along the route giving a cheery wave.</p><p>Some made the first stop, other 'canoers' didn't. It was so funny to hear the blame and counter-blame of why the boat went in the wrong direction. Thanks to Howard and Susan who kept Daddy most amused. We did eventually stop for lunch at Lower Lydbrook and a much earned rest. Daddy and Auntie Ellie who paired in a boat wondered why Charlotte and Pop Pop were quicker, so we swapped partners and we don't like to say what the results were. Needless to say Auntie Charlotte was in the stronger boat on noth occassions.</p><p>Come mid afternoon we finally reached Symonds Yat. Exit points from the river were few and far between, all charging to exit on their land! One canoe hire company was very reluctant to provide information on where we could drag the boats out. Very unfriendly. We finally made it out of the water, 42 miles since Hereford. A big well done and thank you to all who took part.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_17-19-RossOnWye.jpg</src><caption>13 miles to Symonds Yat</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 32: Dickens - Russel Square to Farringdon</title>
    <info>
		<p>Another of our London Walks, this time the Dickens walk. We caught the tube from Gunnersbury to Russel Square where our walk began. Well, a kind of a false start really as just around the corner was Corams Fields which we've visited a number of times, so we decided to stop there for our picnic and a play on the swings.</p><p>Now some walking. </p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_19-12-DickensWalk.jpg</src><caption>Down Chancery Lane, near Grays Inn</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_19-31-DickensWalk.jpg</src><caption>Nice architecture and trees at Temple</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_19-43-DickensWalk.jpg</src><caption>Monkeying around by Temple</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_19-51-DickensWalk.jpg</src><caption>Walking beside the Thames</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_19-65-DickensWalk.jpg</src><caption>Don't lose your head Ben</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_19-81-DickensWalk.jpg</src><caption>Ben waiting for the tube</caption></image>

    <title>National Rail Museum - Cross Farm Fair - Circus</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ben and Daddy took the long trip with farfar to the railway museum at York. We went by train, the first long distance express train journey made by Ben.</p><p>Farmor took us to Woking station where we took the 8.11am train to London. A bus ride on the number 59 took us to Kings Cross where we took the 9.30 train to York. It was a full of passengers but we all got a seat. The train was very fast and travelled at an average of 90 miles per hour.</p><p>The museum was very big and we saw lots of engines, carriages and other bits of railway things. Ben was very active in a short lecture on propulsion and kept volunteering for experiments and answering questions. We returned on the four o’clock train back to London which had more room and we sat at a table to ourselves. We then had some fish and chips in London before catching the train from Waterloo.</p><p>There was plenty to eat and drink all day, perhaps too much drink because Ben went the toilet three times on the train to York, once at York station, four times in the museum, four times on the train coming home and again at the fish and chip restaurant outside Waterloo station.</p><p>Meanwhile us girls went to ballet which was open for all to watch. Later we popped over to Cross Farm school where we were running two stalls the Lucky Dip and XXXX. Farmor won a day for two at a trendy spa place. Very nice.</p><p>Later in the afternoon Farmor took us to Pirbright to see the circus. We loved it. A tiring day for us all.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_26-11-YorkRailMuseum.jpg</src><caption>Ben partaking in an acceleration experiment</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_26-26-YorkRailMuseum.jpg</src><caption>Rocket Ben</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_26-44-YorkRailMuseum.jpg</src><caption>Singing off the train at Kings Cross</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_26-53-YorkRailMuseum.jpg</src><caption>Daddy and Farfar</caption></image>

    <title>PGA Golf Championship - Barnett BBQ</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went to church whilst Daddy and Farfar went to the PGA Championship at Wentworth. Farfar's car was really playing up and so they only just made it to Sunningdale. They dumped the car there and went down Onslow Road where they could cut through onto the 12th green / 13th tee. They did have tickets although they weren't needed.</p><p>They saw McGinley, Donaldson, Olazabal, Jimenez and followed Martin Kaymer a bit. They stayed for 3 hours before the struggle home in the car.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_27-17-Golf.jpg</src><caption>Martin Kaymer</caption></image><p>Daddy then joined the rest of us at Richard and Sue's as Felicity was hosting a BBQ. It was a glorious sunny day and we had water facilites in the back garden. Pretty much everyone other than Grandma was got. Auntie Sue put a bucket of water over Pop Pop, All us children got both Mummy and Daddy. Uncle Steven threw a bucket over Matt from his old bedroom. Everyone took a deep breathe and time stood still for a second. A burst of laughter from us lot, and steam coming outof Matt's ears. When Steve dared to come down the stairs he was chased around the garden, he slipped and got the customary soaking that he deserved.</p><p>A good laugh had by all. In the evening Joey and Lily stayed the evening as Uncle Michael was in Asia and Auntie Ellie at work.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_27-25-BarnettBBQ.jpg</src><caption>Auntie Ellie being pulled from the parachute</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_05_27-29-BarnettBBQ.jpg</src><caption>Uncle Peter about to get it</caption></image>

    <title>Tenby Holiday - Explore</title>
    <info>
		<p>We took just over four hours to arrive at the Haven holiday park in Tenby. First of all we unpacked and had a look around our caravan. Benjamin liked it because it had quite a bit of space and a lot of bedrooms.</p><p>Afterwards we got into our swimming trunks and went to the outdoor pool. It wasn't that busy and the water was quite warm. We played races on the slides and did some wiggly swimming. After half an hour we decided to get up and walk into town up some big hills. We overlooked the North Beach where Daddy was made to feel jealous as there was a lone kayaker about to set off into the very inviting bay. We stopped off at the cafe which overlooked the bay and had some yummy food. We walked down to the castle area and then along the beach back to the holiday camp. Along the way we played up some of the rocks and explored some of the scarey caves.</p><p>Soon we met up with Auntie Charlotte, Luke, Duke and the Elders at Bradley's Playground. We went to explore Auntie Ellie's caravan and moved some of our stuff over as Ben and Katie slept there for the night. Much later that evening Ma Ma and Pop Pop arrived having spent 6 hours on the road!!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_06_01-18-TenbyDay1-Explore.jpg</src><caption>Katie posing</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_06_01-30-TenbyDay1-Explore.jpg</src><caption>Jessica pulling a straight face</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_06_01-46-TenbyDay1-Explore.jpg</src><caption>Jessica pulling a straight face</caption></image>

    <title>Tenby Holiday - Folly Farm</title>
    <info>
		<p>Written by Ben</p><p>Had a very good night's sleep even though Mummy and snored all nght Joey slept under his bed and Katie was freezing cos Joey had the duvet. Joey opened a box but didn't want it, Lily and Jess pretended to be monkeys and made mama and poppop get up. The smoke alarm went off but it was a non-event because there was no fire but mummy looked nonchalant as she cooked breakfast. </p><p>The weather was pretty miserable, so we decided to leave another trip to the beach till tomorrow and do Folly Farm instead. Ma Ma and Pop Pop were gasping for a coffee so we stopped off in the excellent soft play area. A rare rest bite from the rain meant we could go out and enjoy the animals. The giraffes were looking very friendly with one another and the camel looked a bit of a mess with it's coat in tatters.</p><p>The troops were getting peckish and therefore demolished Mummy's picnic in double quick time. Uncle Michael made a brief appearance as he had to look after Dilley. He did join us for the farm tractor ride and subsequent trip to see the big old pigs. The words 'Farfar' were uttered in traditional fashion of course.</p><p>In the barn Jessica stroked a rat. She really has little scruples about experiencing new animals. Dog owners have even commented that she is too brave 'as some dogs might nip her'. Still we don't want to discourage her and turn her into a Katie or Mummy. The rain continued so we couldn't really play on the outside playgrounds and toys, instead we had loads of go's on the indoor, olde worldy fairground rides.</p><p>Whilst we went in the indoor swimming pool, Daddy and Pop Pop went to get loads of fish and chips and we sat in front of the TV watching the Queen's jubilee pagent. In the evening we went for the entertainment in the main hall which as ever involved some dancing and screaming. Ben was desperate to be picked and be involved in the on-stage games.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_06_03-41-TenbyDay3-FollyFarm.jpg</src><caption>Jessica stroking a rat</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_06_03-35-TenbyDay3-FollyFarm.jpg</src><caption>The 60 year olds</caption></image>

    <title>Tenby Holiday - Walk into town</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy woke at 4:30am and as it was light he decided to go on a long walk along the railway line and beach with his camera. Everyone else had quite a lie in which meant we were in a bit of a rush to have breakfast and pack up the cars. We had one final dip in the swimming pools and a go on the on-site softplay before walking into town. The boys sneaked a cornish pasty. There punishment was not to have much of the picnic!</p><p>We congrigated on the north beach for our final meet. The Elders were off on their family camping holiday for the week, whilst Charlotte and Luke were meeting friends on the Gower. Us five along with Ma Ma and Pop Pop walked up the big hill at the head of the mainland, then continued along the South beach back to the cars at the campsite. We said our goodbyes and made the long trip home!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_06_04-35-TenbyDay4-Walk.jpg</src><caption>Canon</caption></image>

    <title>Bring Daddy To School</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy took the day off work and had two stints at school. Mummy for the first time in a long time (if ever!) did not take us to school. It was big, bad, Daddy.</p><p>First up Jessica's Frimley Green Pre School. Daddy started by playing on Happy Street making a track up, then indulged in a bit of painting before overseeing the emptying of the recycling into a big lorry. We ended on snack time, excercise, jumping from the top of the climbing frame and of course storytime. Daddy had a few followers around him!</p><p>After some lunch and a £170 bill for fixing the brakes on the car, Daddy went into see Ben at Cross Farm. Ben was very proud and pleased he came in and sported a huge grin. They had to first paint some flags which were to be used at the carnival, then Ben had to write some nice things about Daddy. We had to think hard for that one!</p><p>Free play next, which Ben told his friends that he'd play whatever Daddy wanted. Daddy wanted to play anything. After deliberating on a game of Power Rangers, who being which character caused much discussion. In the end we decided to play good old 'it'. Ben was a popular chap in his class. Friends would ask him if they could play, and Ben was the chap organising the games.</p><p>Later in the afternoon we had a small quiz on countries and their flags and capital city.</p><p>Daddy then swept us all up from our schools and we went back home. Ben conscipted Daddy to play another bout of Civilization which Ben is addicted to at the moment. Daddy thinks it is good up to a point as he is learning about different wonders of the world, different civilization names and different units from back in the day.</p>

    <title>Fathers day, Frensham Ponds, Beaver Day, Wests Over, Sleepover at Elders</title>
    <info>
		<p>As Daddy was going to be away for most of tomorrow we decided to have a mini Father's Day this morning. We (well Mummy really) got Daddy a newspaper and breakfast in bed. Daddy opened an array of presents and cards which was very nice.</p><p>Ben had a day with the Beavers. They had lots of games, activities and craft to do. We couldn't be happier with Beavers. Out of all the clubs this is such a good, well structured thing for Ben to do. He enjoys it to, although he also wanted to spend the day with the rest of us.</p><p>The rest of us met up with the Elders and Pop Pop at Little Frensham Ponds and went for a walk. It was quite a windy and chilly day. This did not deter us children to go in the pond for a paddle. Even Dilzo joined in the fun. We had a great time although it was cold when we got out. We finished the walk in an hour and made our way to the Elder household where we all had lunch and a go on their new trampoline.</p><p>Later in the afternoon we drove into Alton and satisfied Pop Pop's fix for a 'Costa' as he puts it. We had a coke. Mummy and Daddy left Katie and Jessica with the Elders for a sleepover.</p><p>Ben was picked up on the way home. They then prepared for Barrie and Laura to come over. They had a nice evening. Mummy got a bit drunk and slopped red wine all over the new-ish light sofas! She also wanted to make sure that they were the Wests were their best friends and more fun than the Jacksons!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_06_09-52-LittleFrenshamPond.jpg</src><caption>Mummy and Pop and Jessica Jumping</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_06_09-82-LittleFrenshamPond.jpg</src><caption>Mummy and Pop</caption></image>

    <title>London To Brighton Bike Ride</title>
    <info>
		<p>CNL Software were doing the famous London to Brighton bike ride. Daddy kind of had done some training beforehand. It was an early start leaving Knaphill at 6:30. Ben and Mummy waved him off.</p><p>Daddy was larking about before the start of the race and managed to make Jamie crash in to him, tumbling poor Jamie to the floor which meant he sported a nice big bruise for the 54 mile encounter.</p><p>8:00am arrived and the 12 strong team set off. They stayed 12 for about 20 seconds before everyone sped off at their own pace. Most kept in groups. However, Daddy wanted to push himself and see what sort of time he'd come out with.</p><p>For the first 10 miles or so, through London, it was very much a case of stop and start through the traffic lights and fighting his way past busses and traffic. There were some in fancy dress, some even had music blaring out of their bike somehow.</p><p>Daddy was on his own, battling up the hills overtaking alot of people on far better bikes than his. He was on his 10 year old mountain bike with chunky mountain bike tyres. He stopped after about 20 miles for a quick drink and snack. Within a minute, Ryan went past on his £5k racer.</p><p>Both competitive people they said they'd ride together, however, it became quickly apparent they weren't going to wait for each other. It was a race for the final 34 miles!! Daddy did well up the hills, where as Ryan made up the time on the flat and downhill sections. It was nipp and tuck all the way.</p><p>They then came to the mighty Ditchling Beacon, where they were told you'd be lucky to only get half way up before having to walk. Apparently only 7% of riders make it! Prior to this point Ryan must have been leading by 5 or 10 minutes. However, he had got off and started to walk the hill. To Daddy's surprise he saw Ryan ahead of him, not having seen him for the previous 7 or 8 miles.</p><p>Daddy made it and didn't stop for a rest at the top for fear that Ryan would take him again. The final 6 miles were all down hill or flat and quite bitty as there were quite a few traffic light stops.</p><p>Daddy swung around the roundabout by the pier and went down the home stretch where there were loads of people cheering. He raced in at a time of 4 hours 30 minutes. He was very pleased with that time, although wondered what he would have done with a racer or even road tyres.</p><p>Ryan came in soon after. However, he had to wait another 4 and a half hours for the final group of CNL'ers to come through. A good day. Daddy had the enthusiasm to look to his next cycling feat.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_06_17-02-MartinLondon2Brighton.jpg</src><caption>On the 54 mile journey</caption></image>

    <title>Ma Ma's 60th Birthday Picnic</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ma Ma was soon to be 60 years old. To celebrate the family were invited to Llamas Park in Staines, a great venue for the children. However, sayinf that because of the hosepipe ban, the sprayground was shut for the year! Still we had plenty of other things to occupy us. First, in true Weston style we tucked into our picnic.</p><p>We had a game of cricket then Daddy took each of the children in pairs for a ride on the kayak up and down the Thames. Poor old Fraser came a cropper when he walked into the river, slipped forcing Uncle Michael to go in and fetch him.</p><p>Todd and Ollie were over in England to clear Uncle John Garratt's house as they were selling it. It's always so nice to speak with them. Such nice people. Happy birthday Ma Ma.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_06_23-11-Carol60th.jpg</src><caption>The 60 year old</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 33: Mummy's Birthday Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>For her birthday treat Mummy wanted for us to do the Hampstead Heath walk. So after church we drove to Gunnersbury and caught the overground train to Hampstead Heath. Two problems: One, the walk started in Hampstead which was a mile away up a hill. Second it was persistently raining. So we dived into the local greasy spoon which is quite to find in Hampstead and sat down for some grease and chips!</p><p>Thankfully the rain stopped and we were all filled and prepared for the so called 3 mile walk. We went past some interesting landmarks including the real Goldfinger's house, the person who inspired the James Bond villan and Keates residence. After a playground stop we entered Hampstead Heath where Katie and Mummy decided to go swimming in one of the ponds.</p><p>It was a really nice atmosphere. The pay machine failed to work so the lifegaurd let us in for nothing. It was real back to nature stuff. Open air changing rooms and an unheated pond! Katie braved it first and got in. When mummy got in she said it was so cold it took her breath away. The lifegaurd kept a close watch over Katie as it was quite deep. They played and swum around for about 20 minutes before coming back out into the rain.</p><p>The walk meandered through the heath, stopping off to play on trees, some upright some not! With all the hills and stops and extensions, time was marching on and spirits were flagging with some of the troops, not helped when we were directed a mile in the wrong direction!</p><p>We finally returned to Hampstead village where there was a large street market, mini fair rides and a band playing. The sun was out. It was a lovely way to spend a Sunday afternoon. We all slept well that night.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_06_24-17-HamsteadHeathWalk.jpg</src><caption>The tiddlers</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_06_24-59-HamsteadHeathWalk.jpg</src><caption>Da Famille</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_06_24-62-HamsteadHeathWalk.jpg</src><caption>A fallen tree provides a good playground</caption></image>

    <title>Mummy's Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy's been egging out her birthday now for this second day. We started with the customary present opening in bed at a ridiculously early time. Daddy did a marvelous job of wrapping up the presents in...... newspaper.</p><p>Daddy didn't do a good job in providing a haircut and a pair of canvas shoes. Jessica bought some sandels, Katie a cup she decorated at Brownies and a packet of Liquorice Allsorts and Ben did have a flower which died 3 days previous, but made a good recovery by giving a white vest top.</p><p>Mummy got makeup from Auntie Charlotte, perfume from Ma Ma and Pop Pop and a peg bag from the Fars!</p><p>The birthday girl spent the morning at Joshua's special needs school watching their sports day. Jessica was allowed to join in and she was awarded a medal which she was very pleased and proud about.</p>

    <info>
		<p>In the morning after ballet and baby sitting the Bandoz children, which incidently saw Oliver beat Daddy in a game of chess, we went off to Katie's school fair. Mummy volunteered to run a few stalls which allowed us children to go around and spend the five pounds we were each given. Ben hauled 8 teddy bears, one of them we had given in the first place! Jessica had her hair dyed pink and Katie bought some small stones in a plastic box!!! They saw her coming.</p><p>We dashed back home and went across to the RLC Army Show which is a must for us. This year we met up with school friends and the Fars. All the old favourites were there including the water tight rope, the inflatable assault course and fairground. We had a go in the paintball and grenade throwing practice!! Of course there was tug of war and parachutists. We had a good time and lasted till they packed up.</p>

    <title>Bike to Woking for a Swim with Ma Ma and Pop Pop</title>
    <info>
		<p>Straight after church, Daddy, Ben and Katie biked up the Basigstoke Canal to Woking Swimming Pool. About 9 miles in under 3 hours in the showery conditions. They did ever so well, especially as Ben is on his diddy bike.</p><p>We met with Ma Ma and Pop Pop and went in the Monkey Pool. It's always a hit. Afterwards we were treated to burger and chips in the cafe upstairs.</p><p>On the way home we popped into Grandma's to celebrate Ellie and Mummy's birthday with some cake.</p>

		<p>Jessica had ballet in the morning which she loves. We then were going for a walk up in London. However, the M4 was shut, so we were going to go the A3 but Guildford was backed up onto the Hoggs Back, so went all the way back to Camberley and found the M3 backed up from Bagshot. We gave up!</p><p>Instead we had a bit of at home day. Daddy made Coronation chicken and sorted the garden out, the girls went shopping and Ben initiated his Bin Weevil Tycoon account.</p>

Jessica with the pre school, Ben in Cross Farm and Katie with the Brownies.</p><p>We had all four Grandparents come to watch along with Uncle Peter. It absolutely tipped down during the procession. However, we all enjoyed ourselves.

    <title>Mummy's First Day As A School Welfare Officer, Jessica at Sandringham School</title>
    <info>
		<p>Mummy had landed a job as a Welfare Officer at Cove Secondary school. Over the next 2 weeks she has 5 days of shadowing the lady who she replaces. The job entails looking after the health of the pupils. Essentially if they are unwell or need jabs then Mummy is the person to administer and look after the children. She has her own little office and requires to keep communication over a walkie-talkie. An ideal and well paid job given this description.</p><p>However, the headmistress is a bit of a control freak and bully, and can be unreasonable. This is an account from not just one member of staff, but every member that Mummy has come into contact with. She's been asked if she really needs this job and that'll she'll be eaten alive!! Great. When Daddy picked Mummy up she was not happy at all and does not like the atmosphere and general attitude and morale of the staff. Still she has another 4 days to make her mind up. Meanwhile she is looking at the job available at Frimey Green Pre School as a teacher. half the salary though. But hapiness overides money on this one.</p><p>As Mummy was at work, Daddy did the school runs and took Jessica to her second practice lesson at Sandringham School. She enjoyed herself and can't wait to start big school.</p>

    <title>Kayaking Disaster, Hannah's Wedding Party</title>
    <info>
		<woops rating="7" woopstitle="Capsized Kayak at QE2 bridge"><p>Daddy woke early and was excited about the pending kayaking trip along the Thames. He'd rang the London Port Authority to check and report his plans and monitored when high tide was due and whether it was going to be too windy. It was close to 11am when we pushed Daddy off at the Woolwich Ferry terminal. He'd just received a smart phone from Auntie Susan which meant he could now track where he was and record his progress. Woo Hoo.</p><p>The weather was appalling but Daddy didn't mind too much in his new rain jacket and had everything else in waterproof bags. Progress was leisurely to begin with with the odd boat passing by. The water was quite choppy, especially when the container ships passed. The wash was bouncing off the stationary barges which made for a bumpy ride.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_07_14-06-KayakWoolwich.jpg</src><caption>Setting off from Woolwich</caption></image><p>Daddy stayed mostly to the south side of the river which was a bit of luck as he quickly found that the back end of the boat was sinking which meant he had to get to shore quickly before he rolled the Kayak over. The nose of the kayak was riding quite high making balance difficult especially with the choppy conditions. However, the nearest bank was infact mud or silt at Thamemede just by the Crossness Sewage Treatment Works! Daddy managed to land the boat on the mud and got out, knee deep in mud, which as a side note was strangely warm and quite a nice feeling.</p><p>Having got out of the boat Daddy tried to empty the boat of water and lifted the pillow which weighed a tonne. Naughtily Daddy had to dump the pillow as he thought that was the reason for the sinking. By this point there were 6 or 7 people watching me struggle around in the mud. The water and pillow was out. A frantic amount of paddling was required to be set free from the bank. However, no change, the nose pointed right up and again Daddy almost rolled the boat. So a hasty return to the bank was made. One of the kids watching asked if I was OK and suggested to move the seat to the middle of the vessel. Good idea!</p><p>It took a while to unstrap everything as again Daddy sank into the mud up to his knees. Seat finally moved to the middle, rain still lashing down. Another ungainly entry to the boat which seemed real uncomfortable without the pillow and Daddy was off again successfully. This time balance was returned.</p><p>Daddy powered on but had strayed into the middle of the river. Soon the London Port Authority boat had spotted this and rounded on Daddy and basically told him to move to paddling near to the bank. It took quite an effort to get over that far and the manouvre was made under the watchfull eye of the LPA boat!</p><p>Soon the Dartford Crossing was upon Daddy. He decided to report into HQ, i.e. Mummy. Coasting on the south side of the river, whilst putting the phone back in the bag, Daddy took the oppotunity to keep his sugar levels up by taking a few Fruit Pastills. He was slowly being sucked into the wooden structs of a pier but didn't make too much effort on attempting to get away, thinking he'll just bounce off it.</p><p>Then as quick as anything the Kayak flipped over on its side turning the contents of the boat into the Thames. A wally, two bags and the paddle. Fortunately Daddy raised to the surface quickly and grabbed the kayak, bag and paddle. He saw the bag with phones and wallet and went under water to grab them. However he missed and that was the last we saw of that. Daddy was annoyed and took a few seconds to compose himself as the current was taking him towards the bridge where there would be increased danger with the swells of water. How easy was it going to be to attempt to flip the kayak over and get back in with all the equipment? A meak failed first attempt let Daddy know that it was at least possible. Unknown to Daddy the Kayak was filling with water. More of that in a moment.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_07_14-08-QE2Bridge.jpg</src><caption>Where the incident happened</caption></image><p>A successful roll of the Kayak meant Daddy could clamber back in and set himself to pass under the bridge safely. His goal of getting to Gravesend was now over even though he strangely felt stronger than ever. However, with the weather and having being soaked he knew it was important to quickly get back to shore. The London Port Authority boat mentioned there was a causeway at Greenhithe to get out. This was a 15 minute paddle from the incident.</p><p>Land at last. The weather was worse than ever, but it didn't mean too much as Daddy was soaked anyway. He tried to pull the Kayak out of the water as he would normally, but found it difficult. He thought he must have sapped alot of energy up with the previous 10 miles of adventure! After a short rest he tried again and found it pretty difficult to move. He managed to get it clear of water. The tide was lowering so was not too worried about it being swept away whilst he went to look for help.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_07_14-07-Greenhithe.jpg</src><caption>Greenhithe Pier</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_07_14-09-Route.jpg</src><caption>The Route</caption></image><p>No phone, no money and not many people about in the rain. Daddy wasn't really sure where he was. Fortunately there was a near by pub which Daddy tentatively went into dripping wet. He asked if he could borrow someones phone. He rang his Mum who was able to relay an SOS message to Mummy, who had only just got to Auntie Karens. The people in the pub even got Daddy a coffee.</p><p>Laura arrived within half an hour or so. When returning to the Kayak we found the reason for the earlier problems of the nose rising out of the water and the problems of dragging it out of the water. The plug at the back of the boat had fallen out which meant the kayak was steadily filling up with water. Just think of a container floating in the bath. Now fill that container with water, see what happens.</p><p>Daddy got a telling off from Mummy and a bigger telling off from his Dad.</p></woops><p>In the evening we joined up with Ma Ma, Pop Pop and the Elders at Mummy's cousin, Hannahs, wedding. She seemed quite a miserable bride, something had upset her. She was also over 8 months pregnant which cannot have been easy.</p><p>The children played really nicely all evening.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_07_14-04-HanahWedding.jpg</src><caption>Newly Weds</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_07_14-87-HanahWedding.jpg</src><caption>The girls hitting the dance floor</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 34: Rainham Marshes</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy left his senses behind and took Dilly out for an early morning walk over at the Rec in Istead Rise. Dilly did some business which a fellow dog walker saw. He was offered a poo bag. Errr. Daddy never found the poo and had to pretend to pick the poo up. They both then ran off quickly before the lady offering the bag found out.</p><p>Jessica was going to spend the next couple of days with the Elders as we needed a babysitter for Mummy's third day of work. She had a great time going for a walk.</p><p>Meanwhile the rest of the family went off to Rainham Marshes for another walk. This overlooked the site of yesterday's fun and games. The walk predominantly was located in the RSPB compound. We didn't see that many birds really. I think we needed binoculars.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_07_15-50-RainhamMarshes.jpg</src><caption>Big Boys</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_07_15-55-RainhamMarshes.jpg</src><caption>Runner</caption></image>

    <title>Katie's Build A Bear Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie shared her birthday party with Natasha who was also turning 9 years old. Katie had been excited since Daddy's birthday, counting down the days to this event. Between the two of them they had invited 8 others to join them at a Build A Bear party. For those uneducated, these parties allow the children to choose a bear, stuff it, clothe it and buy accessories. This all takes place in a shop in Basingstoke. They also played games like Find the teddy bear.</p><p>After, the girls took their new buddies to Pizza Hut and had some food.</p>

    <title>Beaver Football Tournament, Harrisons 5th Birthday Party</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ben had his first football tournament since leaving Frimley Green Cheetahs. He was well excited and donned the blue kit of the Wind In The Willows pack, a name which strikes fear into the opposition. It was five-a-side mini league against a team from Camberley and two from Lightwater.</p><p>Well they didn't do too well initially losing each of the league games and scoring no goals. Cheekily they quialified for the third, fourth playoff and Benjamin only went and scored the winning goal with seconds remaining.</p><p>We were all watching and so happy for him. He actually scored a goal. Even in training he failed to convert. He was even happier when he received a trophy.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_07_21-11-BeaverFootball.jpg</src><caption>Beaver Medal Winnners</caption></image><p>In the afternoon we went over to TriLakes for Harrisons 5th birhtday party. There was a Jakes softplay. It was a boiling hot day, so the children got quite sweaty. Anyway they all played nicely and had a good time. Harrison is well into his Lego, so we got him some dinosaur lego.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_07_21-17-Harrisons5thBirthdayParty.jpg</src><caption>A Hot Ben</caption></image><p>In the late afternoon Ma Ma and Pop Pop brought over Great Grandma for a cup of tea and a chat.</p>

    <title>Race For Life</title>
    <info>
		<p>Along with her fellow playschool teachers, Mummy had signed up for the Race For Life fun run in aid of another Laura, a friend of the playschool's. We drove across to Prospect Park, Reading. It was another gloriously sunny day. Katie and Ben wanted to join in with the runners. Mummy wanted to post a good time and attempt to run the 5km course. Out of the group of ten or so runner, Mummy did come in first place with a respectable time of 35 minutes. Daddy was very impressed especially as she had done zero training. Oh sorry, apparently she had done some power walking. As I say she had done no training!</p><p>We returned home and for the first time this summer we played in the back garden enjoying the sunshine and the warm temperatures. We sort of filled the paddling pool up and got the hammock out. Chill Winston.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_07_22-19-RaceForLife.jpg</src><caption>The Team</caption></image><p>In the late afternoon the Fars came over for a cup of tea and a chat.</p>

    <info>
		<p>Nine years old. It's starting to make Daddy feel old. Anyway Katie was very excited. Ben and Jessica were also pleased for her. This must be the first time when we are all appearing happy at an early morning present opening session. Katie received: Heelys from Mummy and Daddy, a set of rollerblades, £80, lots of clothes, a stolen bracelet and some reading books. We the cash Katie bought a trampoline for the back garden which is a big hit.</p><p>In the evening, The Fars came over to give their presents. Then the five of us went to Camberley cinema to watch Ice Age 4 in 3D. We had a great time, although Daddy was exaperated with the cost of the tickets. £46!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_07_24-15-Katie9thBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Present Opening Time</caption></image>

    <title>Olympic Road Cycle Race, Airsoft, Elders stay the night</title>
    <info>
		<p>It was a lovely sunny day and the Olympics Opening Ceremony had finished in the early hours. Daddy organised a trip to just outside Ripley where we were to see the Great Britain road cycling team in action. We had two superstars in the recent Tour De France winner Bradley Wiggins and the favourite for the race Mark Cavendish. We setup at the road side and there were loads of others watching and creating a great atmosphere. From about 20 minutes before the leaders went past there must have been about 30 police motorbikes racing past, waving at us. Eventually the leaders rushed by. There were 10 or so of them which had about a 5 minute lead over the peleton and the Brits. The Great Britain train did come past and we hooped and roared at them. They had great support. We were confident in gold as the British were seemingly controling the race.</p><p>We raced home to watch the end of the race. By this stage with an hour to go it was looking very unlikely of a good result. This fear became a reality. However, we had a great time and we can now say we've watched the olympics live.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_07_28-19-OlympicRoadRace.jpg</src><caption>British Team leading the Peleton</caption></image><p>Daddy went off with Uncle Michael to play Airsoft until 3am in the morning! Meanwhile we had the Elders including the noisey Dilly to stay the night.</p>

    <title>Jessica rides without stabilizers</title>
    <info>
		<p>We know Jessica can do this, so we tried out the back where the garages are and got Jessica to attempt the start off and ride herself. She struggled at first to master getting the pedal at the top and push off from that. However, after about 10 minutes we had lift off and the balance was reasonably good. After about half an hour we were getting there and Daddy didn't need to be in a catching position. We eventually went over the road to the community centre car park where we were doing big circles and the confidence and enthusiam was growing. Well done Jess we can get rid of the stibilizers (I know the spelling is incorrect but that is how Jessica pronounces stabilizers).</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_07_30-07-JessicaFirstBikeRide.jpg</src><caption>Jessica's first ride</caption></image>

    <title>Olympics: Womens Volleyball</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy applied for and got a ticket for the Women's Volleyball at Earls Court. It was still in the group qualifying stage. However, it just so happened that the first game was number 2 in the world against number 3. aka Brazil v China. Brazil's performance todate in the competition wasn't good and they needed to win today to remain in the olympics.</p><p>Motorbiking was the easiest and quickest option. Daddy was struck quite quickly how nice and friendly all the helpers were. When waiting with a crowd to cross the road the helpers were geeing us up with a sing song and some cheering. Gets everyone in a good, friendly mood. Daddy's tickets were the cheapest you could get and this was reflected in the seating position. Right at the top, back, corner. Still the atmosphere generated by the near capacity 15,000 spectators was good. There was a warm up person who asked quiz questions, filled us in with the laws of the game, etc. Some pumping music and we were all up for some volleyball action.</p><p>It was a very tight, evenly fought contest. Not more than 5 points from each other through out the evening. Daddy got some pictures of course.... about 200 of them!! It was good to get into the game and study the tactics. The main one being, get it to a lady who would try and smash it from the edge of the court near the net. There were alot of high fives and hugging and shouts of encouragement. The game went to the deciding set where Brazil just edged it and won the match after a good couple of hours.</p><p>Daddy was surprised to see that there was another match on the card. He tried various points at getting a better seat. Eventually one of the inspectors turned their back for 10 seconds allowing Daddy to get a good vantage point at the other end of the stadium for the Russia vs Japan game. Was this to be the tallest nation against the smallest. The Japanese number 7 libero player could not have been any taller than Farmor!!</p><p>Japan started off well and put up great resistance. However, the mighty Russia with their 6foot 7.5 inch number 11 were too strong for the gutsy Japanese. An enjoyable and long day at Earls Court.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_03-16-OlympicsVolleyball.jpg</src><caption>Volleyball-tastic</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_03-35-OlympicsVolleyball.jpg</src><caption>Brazzzzil</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_03-76-OlympicsVolleyball.jpg</src><caption>Final throws of the Japan v Russia game</caption></image><locations><location>1115</location></locations>

		<p>In the morning Ben opened lots of presents. They were mainly themed around Stars Wars lego. After some congratulationary phone calls Ben and Mummy built the Battle Of Naboo lego set. At midday Ben's party started and unfortunately because of the weather we had to hold it inside. This didn't dampen the spirits as we played: Throw The Lego In The Tin, Lego Treasure Hunt, Pass The Lego Bomb, Lego Corners, Dancing Lego Names, Blindfolded Lego Pickup and Pass The Parcel. We were split into two teams and the final result was very close. Antendees were: Oliver and Phoebe Stroud, Yuraj, Joe Hamilton Cowel, Freya, Michael from around the corner and Jasper.</p><p>Later in the afternoon Uncle Howard came over as well as Auntie Susan bearing gifts. Ben had a great day.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_05-03-BensBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Present opening</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_05-40-BensBirthday.jpg</src><caption>Party</caption></image>

    <title>Olympics: Mens Football Semi Final</title>
    <info>
		<p>Kind old Uncle Richard Sanders had a spare ticket for the Men's Football semi final at Wembley and decided to invite Daddy along. It was the Mighty Mexico against the Jubilant Japanese. They both took a half day at work and caught the train to Waterloo and decided to see what Horse Gaurds Parade was all about. Of course they could not get near it because it was also the location where the Triathlon past through not more than 2 hours previous. Still it was all very grand and got us in the olympics spirit.</p><p>They tubed it to Wembley Park where they were met with a mass of people.... not supporters as such which made for a strange atmosphere at a football match. There was no menace or electricity in the air. There was a little chanting from a group of Mexican supporters but 99% were groups of people who just wanted to see an event. A capcity crowd of 83,000 shared the experience. The seats were high up reasonably close to the Royal Box. The match itself was akin to a training session. A lot of keep-ball with a smattering of tackles. Some of the goals were good. Japan sat back and folded as soon as they went 1-0 up. They tried to sit on the lead and as soon as Mexico scored Japan could not find the quality to strike back. Mexico ran out a deservid 3-1 winners and face the strong Brazil in the Final. Most memorable thing: The amount of people lining Wembley Way.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_07-03-OlympicFootball.jpg</src><caption>83,000 crowd lining Wembley Way</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_07-11-OlympicFootball.jpg</src><caption>Mexico on the attack again</caption></image><locations><location>113</location></locations>

    <title>Olympics: Olympic Park and Womens Diving Final</title>
    <info>
		<p>Kind old Uncle Steven had a spare ticket for the Womens Diving. Almost more importantly the Aquatics Centre was located inside the Olympics Park. So again Daddy had another half day and raced up to London to meet up with Steve. They headed straight to Stratford and expereinced the Park! Again loads and loads of people milling around. And again the staff and helpers on the park were very welcoming, asking how you were, getting you to sing, do high fives, etc. There were another set who were the Coco Cola entertainers who did all the above but in an organised way. Daddy and Steve walked around the whole park as they had 4.5 hours to kill before their event began. They took in the Coco Cola Beat Box which is a little hard to describe its purpose. Essentially you put your hand on or near various surfaces and music would play or change in pitch. They swirled around the outside of the building. It didn't quite work. Anyway once they reached the top they got a nice picture with the Olympic Torch. Inside the tower was loads of mirrors and then some lanterns which changed colours and opened and shut. I know I am not making much sense here, it is a little hard to describe. Once they descended back to the bottom of the building on the inside you got your free coke and some of the entertainers dancing.</p><p>Back into the blistering heat of the Olympic park. They finally reached the opposite end where the Hockey stadium was and rested watching the big screens in the park. They saw Nicola Adams get her gold medal. They took in some sustenance in the form of fish and chips before hot stepping it over to the Aquatics Centre. The tickets were £50 each and for that you got a seat at the top of the stadium. They were higher than the main roof! Still they had a good unobstructed view. There were 12 girls each having 5 dives. The chinese lady won it by loads. The two boys were sort of able to predict the scores, mainly based on the amount of splash made. The session lasted a couple of hours, getting out just in time to see the 200m final. They watched it in the Panasonic 3d Home Cinema centre, which for daddy didn't give anymore experience than a normal tv. Anyway they saw Usain Bolt cruise home for another gold medal. The chaps still eager for more headed to the park with the big screens again, sat back and enjoyed a beer and the atmosphere as the sun set. Almost romantic eh? It was chucking out time at the stadium and both made it home at gone 1am in the morning! Thanks Steve for the ticket and a great day out.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_09-21-OlympicParkDiving.jpg</src><caption>The Orbit</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_09-26-OlympicParkDiving.jpg</src><caption>The Park overlooking the Riverbank (Hockey Stadium)</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_09-45-OlympicParkDiving.jpg</src><caption>Stadium at night</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_09-53-OlympicParkDiving.jpg</src><caption>Inside the Coco Cola Beat Box</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_09-71-OlympicParkDiving.jpg</src><caption>Giving The Dawg A Walk In The Park</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_09-88-OlympicParkDiving.jpg</src><caption>Me and Steve In Front Of The Rings and the Aquatics Center</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_09-131-OlympicParkDiving.jpg</src><caption>Got the moves like Jagger</caption></image><locations><location>1120</location><location>2401</location></locations>

    <title>Olympics: Wrestling - Joey and Lily Sleepover</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ben was really excited about the pending day up in London to watch the Olympics with Daddy. Ben's ticket cost £6 which he thought was very reasonable. The boys caught the train from Brookwood stright up to Waterloo where much to Ben's delight they were handing out free ice lollies. We took a bus trip to Bank on which we saw loads of the London landmarks. We wondered to get some lunch and then onto the DLR to Mansion House and the Excel centre. We had tickets for the 1pm showing of the 55kg and 75kg heats, well all the rounds upto and including the semi finals. We sat in the holding area for a bit to eat our lunch, watch the camera crew go around and soak in some of the atmosphere. There were quite a few foreigners in today, mainly from the nation who are competing which comprise mainly of the countries to the south of Russia as well as the North American contingent.</p><p>Once the wrestlers came out the action was fast paced, especially as there were three bouts being fought simultaneously. For each fight closest to us we each picked the person who we wanted to win. Each bout lasted about 15 minutes. The North Arena 2 was close to it's 10,000 capacity although we managed to sneak forward to get better seat half way through the sitting. I think it just about held Ben's interest although he was very fidgety. We were always routing for the Western countries. He was getting well into it. After about 3 hours the session ended and we were ready to go home. On the way home we say this funny man from Thailand who was clothed in national dress and had a mask which surrounded his head that made he appear to have 4 faces. Spooky.</p><p>Greeting us at Brookword station was Mummy, Jessica, Katie, Joey and Lily. How we all fit in the car I don't know. They stayed the night as their mummy and daddy had a wedding to go to.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_10-06-OlympicsWrestling.jpg</src><caption>Opening Gambit - An Ice Lolly</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_10-21-OlympicsWrestling.jpg</src><caption>More Takewnado than wrestling.

    <title>Barnett's - Wellington Country Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Auntie Ellie and Uncle Michael came around to pick up their offspring and have a cup of tea.</p><p>For lunch we were to meet with Steven, Joyce and Eva at Wellington Country Park where we had a lovely big picnic. The weather was gorgeous and hot allowing us children to go off and play. First we went on the bouncy mat, then onto the slides. We played piggy in the middle with Daddy and Steven and the sticky bat and ball game with mummy. Daddy and Ben also made up a game of golf. Instead of hitting a golf ball with a club, we kicked a ball with our feet. We had obstacles to go through then a tree to hit. It was good fun.</p><p>Daddy unfortunately had to go to work up in London to help support the security system the British Transport Police were using for the Olympics. They have over 45,000 camera patroling stations all over the country. Still he had nothing to do really as it all worked ok and got paid £400 for his troubles!</p><p>Meanwhile us children went on the train, then over to the water play. Luckily Mummy had brought our swimming stuff and we stayed until gone 6pm! We want to come back here again!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/</src><caption>Wellington Country Park</caption></image><locations><location>1010</location></locations>

		<p>It was a very hot day. Daddy and the two young ladies decided to bike down along the canal to Frimley Lodge Park where the CNL BBQ was being held again. Jessica did ever so well biking all that way and didn't get tired. Anyway we had the BBQ and the usual assortment of games: Rounders, football and the tug of war.</p><p>Ben had Charlies birthday party to attend at Tomlinscote school. It was a pirates and princesses party and luckily Ben chose to go as a pirate. They then joined the rest of the crew down at the park.</p>

    <title>Elizabeth and Joel's Wedding</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had a two hour trip into the Cotswolds where Mummy's childhood friend was getting married in a Humanists wedding. It was a beautiful setting on a farm in the middle of the countryside, 5 miles outside Tetbury. Elizabeth had moved to New York over 10 years ago so her life was very much based over there which was reflected in Joel's nationality and many of the congregations. It was a scorching day, too hot for suits, but the weather did allow us to have the marriage be performed outside on the lawns. When I say a farm, it was very much geared to large gatherings with a very plush interior and facilities for food and drink. Not a cow shed where we had to slaughter our own food and milk a cow for fluids!</p><p>It was interesting speaking to some of the American guests they were all very friendly and it was good to see they were mixing in well with the natives. The ceremony itself was conducted by a lady who told us things about the couple, how they met and their feelings for one another. Almost how a marriage should be without all the stuffy religious garnish! No hymms as well.</p><p>The wedding breakfast was lovely and we didn't have to pay for a drink all evening. The happy couple had chosen to have a wedding cheese cake which was very cool for the likes of daddy and served as the source of food later in the evening.</p><p>Katie, Ben, Jessica, Joey and Lily had teamed up with a couple of other similarly aged children and practiced for about an hour on putting on a performance. We were not too sure what was in the production. After some disputes and change in direction, I don't the children knew quite exactly what was going to be included. However, the children were very eager to get as many people down to show off their efforts. There was a mixture of rolly-polies, headstands and the curious, allbeit popular, discus throwing. There were plenty of us to shout and cheer the children on and they were lapping up the applause at the end.</p><p>Although Ben wanted to dance 'all night long', as we participated in the disco dancing time was marching on and we had to leave as early as possible tomorrow for a trip east. We arrived at home at 1am in the morning. Thanks and congratulations to the happy couple. It was a great wedding.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_19-39-ElizabethJoelWedding.jpg</src><caption>Vows</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_19-83-ElizabethJoelWedding.jpg</src><caption>The Show</caption></image>

    <title>Eastern Holiday: Daddy Saves Little Girls Life, Walk 35: Hadleigh Castle</title>
    <info>
		<p>Day one of our summer holiday. This year we wanted a break from going west and decided to go erm... east. The popular jet-setters destination of Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk! We trooped onto the M25, got stuck in a traffic jam at Dartford Tunnel. Went below where Daddy capsized a month before and arrived at Benfleet. Of course our parents were not prepared to pay for parking and after a lot of searching Daddy eventually dumped the car in a leisure centre in Canvey Island! Interesting. So we had 6 more walks to complete from the original book. All of which are in hard to get to locations.</p><p>We began at Benfleet station at about midday, when the sun was at it's highest and seemingly hottest. All but Mummy had removed their tops as we headed east towards Leigh On Sea. Mummy found it difficult to follow the map and a couple of times got a bit stressed as we went along the wrong route.</p><p>Daddy enjoyed this route as we followed a railway line and the contribrituary to the Thames and the English Channel. We were at the spot of where the Thames ends and the sea starts. We passed through farmers fields of corn, cows and ponds. On top of the hill was the location of the Mountain Biking in the Olympics. We could see the fencing around the perimeter but not alot else. We climbed a big hill and found the ruins of Hadleigh Castle. The views were fantastic over the Thames estuary and the weather gorgeous. Us kiddies decided to climb the ruins which made flutters in Daddy and Mummy's hearts as they weren't designed for adventurers.</p><p>After a short stop up here we descended to Leigh On Sea for a much needed cold, icey drink and explore of the local fish stalls and shops.</p><p>There was a real small beach and luckily we brought our swim stuff so went out for a paddle and swim. The tide was in so there wasn't too much beach. Daddy was stressing over getting sand over and into everything. Yeah Dad whatever! We found a concrete causeway underwater which allowed us to walk further out into sea. The current was quite strong so it was important we kept our feet and stayed on the concrete. There was another young girl of about 6 years old about 10 metres away doing the same thing. However, the current swept her off the ledge of the concrete gang way. She started to struggle to keep afloat and began to scream for help. She was panicing to stay above water. Daddy was close by and was able to grab her and keep her afloat. The current was still strong and goodness knows what would have happened to her. Daddy picked her out and carried her over to an understandably anxious mum who was watching her every move, but didn't realize that there was a concrete path effectively keeping us all a foot or two higher than the seabed. It shocked Katie quite a bit. She commented she didn't like the sea anymore. After a bit she returned to the water as did the other girl after she had calmed down.</p><p>We got changed and walked back to the railway station and caught a train back to Benfleet where Daddy went along way to retrieve the car. We then meandered our way north to reach our night's stop in Clacton On Sea via Pizza Hut. It was a very warm night and Daddy snuck out to watch the second  half of the Manchester United's opening game of the season against Everton. We lost 1-0!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_20-08-EasternHoliday-Day1-Hadleigh.jpg</src><caption>Hadleigh Castle in the background</caption></image>

    <title>Eastern Holiday: Clacton On Sea, Walton on the Naze, Rollerworld, Walk 36: Mersea</title>
    <info>
		<p>Having missed Clacton last night, we decided to wander down to the pier in the morning to expirience the delights of Clacton pre 9am! Well needless to say nothing had started up but we did manage to get on to the pier which was filled with fairground attractions. It was pretty big. Anyway we went to the top and back and we also went out on one of the groyns which led out to sea. Jessica of course slipped over on the seawwed and needed rescuing! There was a boy who was doing back flips onto the sandy beach. Very impressive.</p><p>Daddy was adament in going up to Walton on the Naze for two boring reasons. 1) Jamie at work went there for all his childhood holidays and 2) It's one of the locations mentioned on the shipping forecast. Curiousity got the better of Daddy and had to see what the place was like. Well Walton had a big pier and a very nice sandy beach. Somewhere to come back to when we have more time. We had to get to Mersea which wasn't far as the crow flies, but we had to go back into Colchester in order to get back out to Mersea.</p><p>We headed to the less popular East Mersea and Cudmore Grove Country Park. Here we explored around the coast to see the World War II costal defences. We played in the clay and got very black legs and in the pill boxes.</p><p>A change of scenery back into Colchester to the fun-filled Rollerworld. We all had skates and circled around the purpose build rollerskating rink. All the children improved as the session progressed. Jessica at first seemed she was on 3 bottles of vodka a day and almost mastered balancing by herself at the end. Ben was able to get around without falling over and Katie was quickest out of us all, including the adults. We had time trials as well as challenges set by the dj. We managed to make a train of 4 which was the highest out of everybody. Medals please.</p><p>We then went to find Highwood Country Park and had time trials on the assault course that was there. We could race against each other. We stopped off for fish and chips and headed to our hotel room in Feering.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_21-05-EasternHoliday-Day2-MerseaRollerworld.jpg</src><caption>Clacton Sea Pier</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_21-26-EasternHoliday-Day2-MerseaRollerworld.jpg</src><caption>Playing in the Mersea</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_21-35-EasternHoliday-Day2-MerseaRollerworld.jpg</src><caption>Wheely good Ben</caption></image>

    <title>Eastern Holiday: Walk 37: Dedham Vale, Burgh Castle, Great Yarmouth</title>
    <info>
		<p>We were up and about early and managed to make our first destination, Flatford by 9am. We were on the Dedham Vale walk which takes in Constable's country, the scene of the Haymaker. Mummy is losing confidence on our excellent walks book. With the phone now we can track the length of the walk and compare it to what it says. We always seem to walk further by about 20%.</p><p>We started in the picturesque setting with cottages and ponds and countryside. We soon made off along the path into the wilderness. We entered fields of sheep and cows on our figure of eight walk. We followed the River Stour to Dedham where we stopped to marvel at the church and marvel even more at the sweets we were allowed to buy.</p><p>Along the whole journey Katie and Ben were 'Just pretending...'. It was so lovely to see not only them getting on so well which took their minds off the unpopular walk, but they were being quite imaginitive in making a story which they were part of. Of course it followed along the lines of Star Wars - Power Rangers. They were leaders who could teach their young on how to fight. The 'gem' would make them able to teach better, whilst the 'power' would give them extra fighting skills. They debated whether the 'Boss' was the leader of everything or just the boss of the elite fighters! There was a lot of discussion over hierarchy.</p><p>We were a mile over the quoted 4 mile walk confirming mummy's suspicions. We came back to a full car park and scooted off north to leg 2 of the holiday, Norfolk. Burgh Castle was over an hour away. The weather was still pretty good, warm and sunny. The castle or fort dates back to Roman times and looked pretty impressive in terms of it's size. 4 metre walls going on for 100 metres or so. We played some more games whilst mummy and daddy were admiring the views.</p><p>We dumped our stuff at the hotel and then went out into Great Yarmouth for the evening. We ate at a restaurant called Fatso's. It was like heaven for the kiddies. Chips and ice cream!</p><p>We felt quite uneasy then walking to the beach, plenty of druggy looking people all very hectics and shouting and poor looking people. Anyway it was dusk at the beach where we mucked around a bit, played in the arcades and watched the Heart Radio traveling show. A band was on singing covers. Quite a few there. We didn't stay for the fireworks instead returning to the hotel for the nights sleep. We had brought our inflatable matress to fit us all into the room. Children getting too big to share a bed now. So although we'd officially only booked in two children we had to sneak the third in.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_22-09-EasternHoliday-Day3-DedhamBurghCastle.jpg</src><caption>Where Constable painted something famous</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_22-29-EasternHoliday-Day3-DedhamBurghCastle.jpg</src><caption>Up in the hills</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_22-64-EasternHoliday-Day3-DedhamBurghCastle.jpg</src><caption>Burgh Castle</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_22-90-EasternHoliday-Day3-DedhamBurghCastle.jpg</src><caption>Hammer Time in Great Yarmouth</caption></image>

    <title>Eastern Holiday: Pleasurewood Hills</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had a short trip down to Lowestoft for our next Theme Park of Pleasurewood Hills. Thinking about it, we've done quite a few theme parks in our time. Of course all the popular ones around our way, but quite a few out of the area. Some of the not so well known ones. This is one of those. There was a smattering of rollercoasters and other fairground type rides. There was plenty to fill a day and even better Jessica could join in quite a bithaving reached over 1 metre in height. In fact Katie is 1.32m, Ben is 1.22m and Jessica 1.03m.</p><p>Jessica's favourite ride was the traditional Pirate Ship where she kept her hands off the rails when it was at its highest! She along with mummy also enjoyed the Grass In The Snake rollercoaster. We also loved the 'Flying Like Superman Ride' which is one we not seen before. Your caged in lying down on your tummy and then the ride spins around, going up and down. The other favourite was the dinghy down a massive slide ride.</p><p>The most stand out features of today however were the sideshows. The one in the morning was the seal show with all the normal tricks like balancing and juggling balls, splashing the kids and all that. It was presented in a very good way. The show in the afternoon was performed in a theatre and was absolutely excellent. Sean Alexander has performed on Britain's Got Talent, he was an illustionist and performed these fantastic tricks. We were left thinking, 'how did he do that?'. It was very professional, I can see him making the Tele one day.</p><p>Overall you can never go wrong with a theme park we all had a good day. We stopped off in Oulton Broad for some din dins, then ventured into Norwich City Centre for our night's stay. Dadddy didn't get much sleep as he had a really bad back.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_23-02-EasternHoliday-Day4-PleasurewoodHills.jpg</src><caption>This Rollercoaster is no match for Katie</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_23-22-EasternHoliday-Day4-PleasurewoodHills.jpg</src><caption>Seal show</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_23-25-EasternHoliday-Day4-PleasurewoodHills.jpg</src><caption>Let's fly</caption></image>

    <title>Eastern Holiday: Bewilderwood</title>
    <info>
		<p>Bewilderwood was a reasonably new attraction set in the woods near Wroxham. It's basically a suped-up playground with slides, 3 man swings, zip wires, climbing frames that scale up in to the trees. We started with a little boat ride through the marsh to reach the main bits. The kiddies loved the slides the most. They were made from plastic, with low friction, which meant high speeds. You could see they were a little scared going down on the first few gos. Again Jessica was well in there going on with the big boys.</p><p>We had lots of competitions going on the apparatus, mainly time trials. Of course Ben fell off a few times which caused a some tears. He also got grumpy with himself when he didn't win. He gets quite compeititve ensuring fair play. Later in the afternoon there was an area in the woods where you could build your own den out of sticks that were scattered around. A challenge for Daddy and us kiddies. Mummy had a little sleep. So king bodge and his collection of sticks. A camp was made but you had to be careful that you didn't sneeze too close. It was strudy enough for us to play in at least for a bit. We got our photos and then trashed it before others did, as those scavengers wanted our sticks.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_24-62-EasternHoliday-Day5-Bewilderwood.jpg</src><caption>Slipery Slope</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_24-84-EasternHoliday-Day5-Bewilderwood.jpg</src><caption>Our Den</caption></image><p>We finished up late afternoon and returned to our base in Norwich before walking into the city centre to get some food. The trouble is that we have been eating out every evening and it normally involved chips and grease. So we all agreed on an Italian. Daddy refused Pizza Hut, snob! Well yes, the experience from 4 days ago has put him off with screaming kids, dirty toilets and worries of quality and hygine. Other than that it's fine. Instead we went to an Italian Restaurant at the top of town. At first we were the only customers which was nice as we didn't have to worry about the awful table manners of the children.</p><p>Daddy, Ben and Katie were thinking about going to the evening Banger Car Racing in Swaffham, however they ran out of time. Instead we all leisurely made our way back to our hot hotel room for bath and bed.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_24-11-EasternHoliday-Day5-Bewilderwood.jpg</src><caption>Norwich City Centre</caption></image>

    <title>Eastern Holiday: Banham Zoo, Needham Market</title>
    <info>
		<p>We headed south and today's destination was a new one, a zoo we've not visited before at Banham. The weather was a bit iffy, however, we felt that there was not many people there, especially for a Saturday during the summer holidays. I hope the zoo is doing alright. Another £60 or so pounds worth of entrance fees. It's expensive stuff kids and going out eh?</p><p>We wandered about looking at the animals. The best bits were the talks and shows we went to. The birds of prey talks and demos were fantastic, made twice as good by the presenters. We saw the Harris Hawk and Falcon, Eagle, and even 7 vulchers. They were agressive. The presenter said we should be sympathic with the animals and that they unfairly get a bad press. We all eat dead meat.</p><p>We then saw another animal show and both Mummy and Daddy now love the armadillo. The ran across the stage a couple of times. He had diddy legs and he was suprisingly fast. We saw the tiger very close up, monkies, giraffes, the usual zoo fair.</p><p>We made it to our hotel in the evening, then went out to Needham Market and ate fish and chips by the lake and playground. Very nice sunset before returning back and another epic game of Binweevil Top Trumps. Ben is the champion at this, and knows most of the card values off by heart.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_25-09-EasternHoliday-Day6-BanhamZoo.jpg</src><caption>Wind your neck in</caption></image>

    <title>Eastern Holiday: Bressingham Steam, Thetford Forest Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>We travelled north past Diss and on to Bressingham Steam. Farfar was envious as he stated there were 6 different gauges (track width) of railway there. The enthusiasm didn't really spread to the girls. We travelled through the woods on a number of the steam trains which was very nice. Each trip lasting 10 or 15 minutes.</p><p>There were some nice gardens there, which is not our cup of tea generally, but it was a pictureque landscape. One of the best bits of the place was the exhibition centre where there were shops set in the 40's and the Dad's Army museum.</p><p>After leaving we spent a bit of a wild goose chase looking for the Horse Sanctuary which looked really good.... if it was open. Instead we shifted down to Thetford Forest and went to it's excellent park.</p><p>We almost didn't go in as it was quite expensive for parking. However, when we did go in it was packed and the charges were justified as there was excellent play equipment for the kids hidden in the forest. One section had loads of musical apparatus. It was on a par with Bewilderwood but £60 cheaper! We spent two hours playing there. It had play equipment that we've not seen before. I think we've become experts in this now. It's what the children like doing best.</p><p>Time was marching on so we made it down to Mildenhall for our hotel and trip into Little Chef.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_26-23-EasternHoliday-Day7-BressinghamSteam.jpg</src><caption>Ben driving St Christopher</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_26-33-EasternHoliday-Day7-BressinghamSteam.jpg</src><caption>Kids Army</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_26-41-EasternHoliday-Day7-BressinghamSteam.jpg</src><caption>Daddy and Eldest Daughter in the gardens</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_08_26-12-EasternHoliday-Day7-BressinghamSteam.jpg</src><caption>Forest</caption></image>

    <title>Eastern Holiday: Clare Castle Country Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today was home day. Mixed emotions as we'd enjoyed our holiday, but wanted to sleep in our own beds. We decided to go to Clare Castle Country park which was way out in the sticks. Mummy and Daddy had their first argument, which overall can be classed as a successful holiday. Holiday's success are now measured in number of arguments, and one in 7 days isn't bad going. Anyway hopefully mummy won't keep brushing against hedges at 40mph now!</p><p>The town of Clare was very quaint, olde worlde and a place to show off to a tourist. We went to the close by country park for a short walk, a visit to it's ruined castle and off course more time trialing in the playground. A feature born from this holiday I think.</p><p>We got back home by about 3pm, decamped from the car and got into sorting stuff out mode. The holiday was over. Another goody, and again would look to Travelodge around an area for our next holiday. It suits what we like in our holidays.</p>

		<p>We had a Danish lunch over at the Fars. Plenty of fish and cold meat. Other than Daddy, we didn't go too close to that of course. Auntie Susan and Graham were also there. Farfar prepared a good treasure hunt for us where we found lots of sweets and money. Oh it was also Mummy and Daddy's 12th wedding aniversary.</p>

    <title>Back to school</title>
    <first name="jessica">First day at school</first>
    <info>
		<p>All three of us had our first day at school today. Jessica was to start at Sandringham in her green uniform, Ben moves up to Frimley C of E. The prospect of going to school didn't really excite the two eldest, and Jessica just took it all in her stride, a little nervous, but I think the lure of being seen to be a big girl and learn like her two older siblings negated any bad thoughts.</p><p>Both Mummy and Daddy took us all to school. Jessica joined other older children for a three hour session. She was led to her classroom where she played for the first day. Mummy cried a little. End of another era.</p><p>Come hometime it was hard to get anything out of any of the children. After we cycled home, we explored what was put in the school bags. Jessica had her first book. No words, just following a story in pictures. She also had four keywords to learn to read: A, And, Is, Dad.</p><p>She was keen to start learning them. Mummy will ensure this will be practiced every day just like with Katie and Ben. Jessica came out quite tired we think or overwhelmed. She was pretty quiet.</p><p>Katie and Ben had good first days. Ben has already been told not to keep putting his hand up to answer the questions the teacher poses.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_09_05-05-FirstDayAtSchool.jpg</src><caption>Back to school</caption></image>

    <title>London To Southampton Bike Ride, Katie to Auntie Charlotte's</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie was dropped off at Grandma's where she was scooped up by Ma Ma and Pop Pop to go over to Gloucester to spend a weekend with Auntie Charlotte. They went shopping and then had fish and chips in the evening and slept in Auntie Charlottes new flat.</p><p>Meanwhile the rest of us dropped off Daddy who met up with Nick for their epic, 85 mile bike ride from Kempton Park to Southampton. It was quite a hot day for September, near the mid 20's celsius. Nick had all the gear and the idea, whilst Daddy went on his mountain bike and although he has trained he's not even done half that distance in his practice runs.</p><p>Anyway the ride started off well and they stopped after 35 miles where the Fars had a supply of raspberries and cold milk! They followed them for a while, of course attempting to take photos but failing miserably. Soon Michael joined in at Farnham and then Tino at Binstead where we stopped and all met up for a spot of lunch. Then there were hills. Alot of hills, all up of course.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_09_11-00-LondonToSouthamptonBikeRide.jpg</src><caption>The vital stats and route</caption></image><p>There was some lovely countryside. The last 5 miles or so we were getting into the suburbs of Southampton where the four split up. Nick racing ahead and Daddy getting lost and getting cramp.</p><p>Daddy found his way again and partnered Tino over the Itchen bridge and rolled into Hoglands Park. It was not quite Brighton, but there were a few clapping us in. Mummy was there to take the boys back to Alton. A nice ride.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_09_11-01-LondonToSouthamptonBikeRide.jpg</src><caption>The boys after they finished 80 miles</caption></image><wesaws><wesaw>105</wesaw><wesaw>106</wesaw><wesaw>107</wesaw><wesaw>108</wesaw><wesaw>109</wesaw><wesaw>302</wesaw><wesaw>306</wesaw></wesaws>

    <title>Jessica's 5th Birthday Party - Katie to Thorpe Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>Jessica decided she wanted a butterfly birthday party, much in the style of Ben's lego party. We had 10 friends of hers who came for the midday start. They included a mixture of old playschool friends who are now at different schools, Natasha Burrows and Lily Elder.</p><p>Fortunately the weather was good so we were able to host it mainly in the back garden. We started with hunt the butterflies in the garden, followed by various simple butterfly related games. Food time and a fatal mistake was made. Melted chocolate with choice of dips. Unfortunately there were many pretty dresses which were dipped in the chocolate. Oops.</p><p>Fiona and the Elders stayed on to see Jessica open her presents which were a range from moon sand, dollies, dolly clothing and jacket. She had a good time.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_09_09-05-JessicaBirthdayParty.jpg</src><caption>Party in the back garden</caption></image><p>Meanwhile Katie was taken for a belated birthday treat to Thorpe Park. She had a wicked time. She came back soaked. The queues were long. Almost would try all rides. Auntie Charlotte stayed over the night.</p>

    <title>Paultons Park, Chertsey Football and Swim</title>
    <info>
		<p>We split today, the girls getting free tickets with the Kelley's to Paultons Park. There were not that many people in, so queues were low and we had loads of go's on things.</p><p>Meanwhile the boys went on a bike ride to the library, then on to the Fars for lunch. In the afternoon they joined the Fars on a trip to Chertsey. Before the football match, Daddy and Ben went in the swimming pool in Chertsey. Ben managed 5 lengths back stroke and did well on his front as well. Most impressive. We also sampled the delights of the jacuzzi and the sauna. The first time in both. We then moved on to watch the football at Alwyns Lane and we even spent a while playing around the back ourselves. They then went on a mystery tour led by Ben on the bikes back home from Richmond Close.</p><p>During the week Ben has had a spate of weeing incidents at night. He's kept the bed dry, but mummy's leg and the landing have not escaped!</p>

We had a jobs and clearing up day, but we did manage to play some games. The 'puzzle' challenge was won by Ben and Mummy who beat Daddy and Katie 3-0.

    <title>Charlton V Blackburn</title>
    <info>
		<p>For Mummy's wedding anniversary present she received Family Stand tickets for Charlton v Blackburn, something she was very excited about. Only Ben has been to a big match before so it was new to us girls. We parked up at Slade Green and caught the train in. We stopped in the expensive club shop and walked by the main entrance to soak in some of the atmosphere. 17,000 others were there and the noise really kicked in at kick off. There were drums and not much in the way of bad language either which was pleasing and a bit of a concern before hand.</p><p>The game started relatively slowly with not much to report in terms of goalmouth incident. Us children flipped in bouts of concentration in the match but generally enjoyed themselves. The game ended 1-1 with some exciting bits. Katie has asked if she can go again. Ben still prefers to watch Reading.</p><p>After we got the busy train back and ended up at Ma Ma and Pop Pops and had fish and chips.... well without the fish, but you know what I mean.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_09_29-02-CharltonVBlackburn.jpg</src><caption>At the Valley</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_09_29-11-CharltonVBlackburn.jpg</src><caption>In the Valley</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 38: Elmley Marshes (Isle Of Sheppey) Ride</title>
    <info>
		<p>We awoke and Ma Ma and Pop Pop's at a sensible hour and ventured over to the Isle Of Sheppey for another of the entries in our walks book. Seeing it was a 6 mile plus walk we decided to take our bikes. Of course Jess being on hers this was going to be a test. Although the weather was not too bad, it was pretty windy across the flat marshes at Elmley, a RSPB place. We took a wrong turning on our way and ended up near the new bridge at a dead end where some gypsys were based, complete with caravans, white vans, lots of kids, and a dawg! The man wasn't very friendly when asking for directions.</p><p>We trooped along the path, just to the north of the River Swale. We didn't do much bird watching, but when we were in one of the hides we did hear a flock of birds (I wish I could be more specific but I'm no good at spotting the type) squawking their way across the sky. The trek for the children was about survival on the bikes and who was fastest. After a mile and a half Jessica was first to succumb to giving up, and hopped onto Daddy's bike who gave her a crossbar trip for the rest of the afternoon. Meanwhile Ben fell off his bike countless times, that goes without saying.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_09_30-51-ElmleyMarshes.jpg</src><caption>Survivors Photo</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_09_30-40-ElmleyMarshes.jpg</src><caption>Ma Ma Pedaling</caption></image><p>Not all completed the course, but everyone made a good effort. It was nice to get out and blow the cobwebs away and breathe some fresh air.</p>

    <title>Walk 39: London Markets, Katie sleepover</title>
    <info>
		<p>We headed to Gunnersbury and caught the tube to Aldgate East where our Markets walk began. We meandered through some old London streets with buildings which seemed to have survived the bombing during the war. Trying to imagine if that is the type of housing our ancestors who were from the area lived in.</p><p>We ate lunch early on outside Spitalfields Market which had a lot of retro furniture and clothing. Somewhere Auntie Charlotte would like as she is into all that at the moment. After looking at the market, which Mummy was not too impressed with, we continued to Brick Lane and all it's restaurants. Ben was on top toilet form. On the way back on the tube he first needed the toilet whilst we waited at Mansion House, so Daddy took him back up the station whilst the girls made their way back. After finding somewhere (I am not mentioning where as it is too embarrassing, needless to say he was hopping) the boys followed in the tube behind the girls. Then at Gloucester station we had to get off again as Ben needed a second widdle!! Burger King to the rescue. If that was not enough 10 minutes later as we exited Gunnersbury the Benny Wee Wee Dance manifested and again the side of an office block got a sprinfling. 3 times in half an hour!! He's a doughnut.</p><p>In the evening Mummy went off to Rachel's babyshower over at Karen's house. Katie meanwhile went to Grace's house for a sleepover in Darby Green.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_10_06-09-SpitalfieldsMarket.jpg</src><caption>Katie at Spitalfields Market</caption></image>

    <title>Two Olivers Birthday's, 30 mile bike ride</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ben's best friend Oliver Stroud (aka Strangle) had his birthday treat today and Ben was the only friend invited to accompany his family to Legoland. I think we must be theme parked out after this summer! Anyway Ben shared every ride with Oliver and they really are close, good friends. It was a bit embarrassing as Ben had not managed to make the toilet on one occassion.</p><p>Meanwhile the girls after church went to Jessica's friend's birthday party, Oliver over at the softplay in the centre of Camberley. They of course had a good time there, especially as they had to cycle and catch a bus to get there.</p><p>The reason for the transport issues is that due to a re-schedule of Daddy's bike ride, which needn't have been re-scheduled in the end. Still never mind. Daddy joined his friend Nick on a 30 mile bike ride around through country lanes around Phoenix Green, Basing and Upton Grey.</p>

First wearing the Jon Bon Jovi wig, then treating us to some air guitar on stage.

    <info>
		<p>Katie still away on Brownie Camp. We sort of had a quiet day planned. Steve and Eva popped in which was a nice surprise to give Jessica a belated birthday present. It was £15 in cold, hard cash. Just how Jessica likes it. She has already spent it on 'build-a-bear' stuff! Steve was contemplating sending Eva to private school. I think we left him confused enough for him to be even more undecided.</p><p>After lunch we went over to the Tremears to drop off Graham's 35th birthday present and have a cup of tea. Auntie Susan had only just come in from a bike ride. Jessica was well into playing with the cats.</p><p>Later in the afternoon Peter, Ma Ma, Pop Pop and the Elders came over and experienced an attempt on æbleskiver from Daddy.They didn't turn out quite right, however they were edible.</p>

    <title>Ben beats Daddy at his maths homework!</title>
    <info>
		<p>Nothing too eventful today other than when Daddy went through Ben's homework with him. Mummy had already given up. Anyway Ben had to produce a dictionary of terms to do with shapes that he is currently learning. He was adament in including a square based pyramid and a hexagonol prism! Now daddy got the square based pyramid, but failed on the prism. Not only did he initially draw the shape incorrectly, no need for Google when you have Ben at your side. When it came to listing the number of faces, edges, vertices, Ben was on the button without even looking at the shape. Daddy got it wrong even looking at the shape. We checked Google and of course clever cloggs Ben got it right. Daddy relagated, Ben promoted.</p>

    <title>Church Fair, Kayaking the Wey, Georgia Sleepover</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went along with Mummy and helped at the church fair. We ran the Teddy Tombola and sold out quickly which was rather good. We also had £3 each to spend on what we liked.</p><p>Meanwhile Daddy went over to Godalming and parked up next to a fast-ish flowing River Wey. A unauthordoxed entry by Bridge Street and a slop through the park in the town. Very quickly the railway bridge is reached where the river flows very fast. Almost enough for Daddy not to get through. This was to set the tone as the journey through the rapids was not totally under control. All Daddy thought of was, Is My Kit Going To Get Wet Today? Next 100 yards and a wier. Surveying the situation Daddy decided to decamp and drag the kayak 50 yards past. He then meandered upstream to Eashing passing some difficult bits on the way. There was plenty of logs, debris, bushes and over hanging branches all in there to make a challenge. Once Eashing was reached, a quick bite to eat and the downhill ride back! This was the most difficult as it was hard to control the kayak downstream, slaleming through the obstacles. The final bit were those rapids back in Godalming. Daddy even dumped his bag of goodies just in case he was going to turn the craft over again. However, it was not as bad as he thought and navigated through successfully. A good test.</p><p>In the evening we had a very well behaved Georgia over to play and stay the night. Daddy finally had to go down at midnight and ask the girls to go to sleep. Of course in their den downstairs. They played Barbie, Barbie, Barbie!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_10_20-03-GodalmingKayak.jpg</src><caption>Cross country kayaking</caption></image><locations><location>3</location><location>24</location></locations>

We first went on the corn-blaster, then on the maze. Ma Ma took us in to the very scary Haunted House. There were rooms which were pitch black and silent. Then all of a sudden a loud banging noise came all around us. It was too much for Katie and she cried her eyes out. Next up was the adventurous tractor ride with various props posted all along the route.</p><p>In the evening Daddy and Pop Pop went to visit Farfar in hospital.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_10_29-01-BroadditchFarm.jpg</src><caption>The Corn Blaster</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_10_29-16-BroadditchFarm.jpg</src><caption>Katie Enjoying The Tractor Ride</caption></image>

    <title>Farfar Out Of Hospital, Meet Fi and Helen</title>
    <info>
		<p>We left Ma Ma and Pop Pop and went over to the Burrows residence for a play. Daddy meanwhile went to Ikea and other shops to get Mummy some Christmas presents. Helen I think was pleased not to have children after seeing the chaos caused by all the children!</p><p>When we returned home, Daddy immediately went up to St. Georges with Farmor to collect Farfar from hospital. He was deemed well enough to leave. Although it may seem quite early and Farfar requiring a lot of help and attention it's all stuff that can be done at home. Also research suggests that recovery is quicker at home. There is a mountain of drugs, so we colour coded them all and drew up a chart to say what was to be taken at what time of day.</p><p>Farfar is feeling OK generally. He has a large scar up his left leg from ankle to groin and one from his neck to stomach. Quite a sight. Sometimes he gets quite a bit of pain which can be controlled with paracetamol.</p><p>In the later afternoon Katie was dropped off at the Kelley household for a sleepover.</p>

    <title>Visiting Charlottes New Flat</title>
    <info>
		<p>Yesterday, we finally went over to see Charlotte's new flat that she is renting in the heart of Gloucester. It's a lovely converted warehouse with wooden beams and lovely setting right by the docks. We arrived late afternoon, and after some fun with lost car keys we trundelled to the shops for a spot of Christmas shopping and to get some food in. We all snuggled in the evening and watched the film 'Homeward Bound'.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_11_03-02-GloucesterCharlotte.jpg</src><caption>The Old Warehouse Where Charlotte Lives</caption></image><p>We awoke quite late for us and went out to see the market and shops in the city centre for yet for present shopping. It was quite a chilly day but managed to meet up with Luke and Duke in Gloucester Park for some fun on the playground.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_11_03-12-GloucesterCharlotte.jpg</src><caption>Dockers</caption></image>

    <title>Car Engine Flooded - Firecracker XXI</title>
    <info>
		<p>The day did not start well. It rained heavily which flooded the underside of Frimley Green railway bridge. Other cars passed the bridge successfully, but because of previous damage to the car the gaurd which protects the engine from the wheels had been removed. Therefore when Mummy drove through the deep puddle, the water covered the engine to such an extent it killed the engine and were not able to start the car again..... for 3 days! The girls were able to walk to church. In the afternoon Simon came out with a mate to push the car into Frimley Lodge Park.</p><p>Meanwhile the boys joined Howard, Susan and Pop Pop and went banger car racing at Arena Raceway, Essex. We arrived nice and early. As it had been raining hard the ground was extremely slippery and muddy. There were plenty of casualties, no one came back mud-free. That coupled with the lack of dustbins made for a very untidy environment. Still you'd expect nothing more.</p><p>To the racing. The usual mixture of big American cars, limos, hurses and of course the Robins. The ambulance didn't make an appearance which was out of the norm. There were some great smashes. We visited the muddy pits once which was excellent as we could see the cars up close. Ben enjoyed himself and wants to go again next year.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_11_04-02-FirecrackerXXI.jpg</src><caption>Banger Roller Ben</caption></image>

    <title>Guildford Bike Ride, Swimming, Fireworks</title>
    <info>
		<p>After mummy failed to secure some Christmas presents in Camberley it was up to Daddy to get them on his bike ride to Guildford and back. Another 20+ miles under the belt.</p><p>Auntie Charlotte had stayed the night and returned back home as she and Luke were off to a ball in Birmingham.</p><p>We hadn't been swimming for a long while as a family and Jessica's only exposure is when we as a family go. The usual cocktail of crocodiles, throwing, teasing and general mucking about was served up. We had gone to the baths at Farnborough.</p><p>In the evening we joined Farmor and Auntie Susan for Ravenscotes firework night. It was possibly the longest firework display we had ever seen. It was very good and we were packed with a flask of soup. We preceeded this with a session with some sparklers.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_11_10-13-Fireworks.jpg</src><caption>Sparklers</caption></image>

    <title>Reading v Everton, Teale Sleepover</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Karen, Summer and Alice came over for the day and played. Ben and Daddy were stuck on Civ most of the morning.</p><p>Later, they went over to see the Fars quickly, before moving off to Farnborough to pick up Dadd's work friend, Michael for the Reading v Everton game. They parked up and made the long walk across the J11 M4 roundabout and onto McDonalds where they had some restaurant food and met up with 'Fat Phil' and his brother in law.</p><p>They had tickets in the top corner of the stadium, a pretty good viewing position. Everton dominated the first half and went one - null up, which pleased Michael, the Everton fan. Different story in the second half, Reading recorded their first victory of the season, winning 2-1. Ben loved the game and certainly celebrated when Everton scored.</p><p>After rushing home Daddy went over to Uncle Michael's for a poker night.</p><p>Katie went over to the Teales and slept the night and also didn't go to bed until 3am in the morning</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_11_17-01-Reading.jpg</src><caption>Ben at the Madjeski</caption></image>

    <title>Santa at Redfields, Meeting Emily Glidewell, Sandringham Christmas Fair</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went over to the Sanders household and met Jon and Rachel's new addition to the family, little Emily. She was great only being a few weeks old. We each had a cuddle then made our way down to the garden centre to watch Father Christmas arrive in his sleigh. We waited and waited, then realized that he had come in via a different route so pretty much missed him! Quite a laugh.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_11_24-01-LucyGlidewelll.jpg</src><caption>Welcome Emily Glidewell</caption></image><p>We then rushed over to the Sandringham Christmas Fair which was quite manic. Daddy was all prepared as a goalkeeper in the 'Beat The Goalie' stall. However, because the weather was not great, that stall was canned and daddy worked on the raffle table instead. Mummy on the other hand was helping out on the 'decoarate a buscuit' table who we shared with our neighbours, the Deach's.</p><p>Us children spent loads of money on various nick naks.</p>

    <title>Bike Ride To London and Back</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy for some reason decided to ride up to London on his bike. It was a lovely sunny day. He made it up to the Chelsea area in about two hours which was pretty good going. Then as he was undertaking a van along the Kings Road he hit a van's mirror. 99% sure it wasn't damaged, but Daddy hid in the next side street anyway just in case the man wanted to make a point about it!! Anyway some meandering around London's sites was done. Whilst riding over Westminster Bridge, Daddy almost ran over a tourist who stepped out into the road. Big skid!</p><p>The return journey was a lot longer as Daddy's lack of fitness began to shine through. He struggled to Addlestone where it was begining to get dark and rainy and he was quite hungry and tired. Still he managed to soilder on and made it home mid afternoon. Good to have done. A sense of achievement.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_11_25-01-LondonBikeRide.jpg</src><caption>London and back route</caption></image>

    <title>Fars Over, Lily 6th Birthday, Jessica Sleepover, Caitlin's Birthday. C of E Christmas Fair</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning the Fars came over. First time Farfar has been over since his operation. He got a dose of Katie, Ben and Jessica mayhem. He last an hour or so before he needed to recouperate for the rest of the day.</p><p>We then went to the C of E Christmas fair. Mummy and Daddy ran the lucky dip whilst us lot had a bit of money to spend on some of the stalls. Of course we got the usual array of sweets and teddy's and managed also to get a few Christmas Presents in.</p><p>Katie went over to her best friend at school, Caitlin's 10th birthday party which was held at Coral Reef. She claims to have gone down the fastest flume there. We'll have to see next time. She was there for 4 hours and had a great time. She is in a little gang of her, Caitlin and Liam. Katie is getting grown up and is so sweet. She kept coming out with these little laughs at the end of sentences when she spoke about the party. It so nice to see her so happy and excited.</p><p>After the Christmas Fair, the rest of us went over to the Elders for Lily's 6th birthday party. We dropped Jessica there where she stayed for a sleepover. She loved it.</p>

    <title>Fence Fix Up, Elders House Warming</title>

		<p>In the morning Daddy went around to the Fars to put a temporary solution up for the fence which had blown down during the recent bad weather we've had. Tarpaulin stretched the width of the back garden. Farfar would have done it, but is not fit enough to do so yet. It was decided that once he is better the two boys would work together to put a more permanent solution up.</p><p>In the afternoon we went around to the Elders for a housewarming stroke Lily's birthday celebrations. Katie and Jessica put on talent show where they danced, sang and did gymnastics.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_12_01-07-ElderHouseWarming.jpg</src><caption>Sing It Loud, Sing It Proud</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_12_01-08-ElderHouseWarming.jpg</src><caption>Jessica Soloist</caption></image>

    <info>
		<p>In the early afternoon Ben went to Aldershot Ski Slope for Oscar's birthday party where he doughnutted down the slope. He had a great time and mummy even had a go.</p><p>The annual Gay Christmas Party was down in numbers this year, but there was still as much fun. We had the Elders, Wests and Morleys over as well as Auntie Charlotte. Boys v Girls in a host of games, quizes and tasks. The most notable was the "blindfolded snow ball" game which led to some unlawful physicality between couples! Girls were being dragged by their legs into the kitchen at one point. Charlotte complained of carpet burns!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_12_08-13-ChristmasParty.jpg</src><caption>What are the Morleys Doing?</caption></image><p>The 'Spoons' game also managed to draw blood from Mrs West's hand. It was fiercely competed with Ellie winning out in the end. Special mention to Baz's speed of moving the cards round. Plum!</p><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NVX8odvKZ-I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></center><p>Daddy had done a roast pork and gammon on the BBQ which turned out well. There was plenty eaten. A good night had by all.</p>

    <title>Sanders and Father Christmas</title>
    <info>
		<p>Auntie Charlotte was a little sick this morning which was a little worrying having eaten the party food the night before. Fortunately noone else went down with anything it seemed. We went off to church whilst Daddy went around to the Fars to do a few jobs.</p><p>After lunch we went off to a garden centre in Addlestone with the Sanders to visit Father Christmas in his chalet. It was quite pretty with the mature nordic trees lining the route. Ben managed to destroy the reindeer display by being a bit exuberant with the reigns. It was like watching domino rally as each reindeer fell to the ground. Daddy was not happy!</p><p>We saw Father Christmas in his chalet and crowded his cosy room. Each of us were asked what we wanted for Christmas. Katie mentioned Sylvanian Families and Barbe dolls, Ben, Imaginex and Jessica said a baby! Katie then fell back off her stool and into the Christmas Tree. Oh man. It was funny. What a calamatus family.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_12_09-07-FatherChristmas.jpg</src><caption>The full Sanders and Gay Crew</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_12_09-30-FatherChristmas.jpg</src><caption>It's Father Christmas</caption></image><p>We all headed back to our house for a cup of tea and some apple pie and a bit of a play. Joshua is certainly a smiler.</p>

    <title>Car Breakdown Nightmare</title>
    <info>
		<p>Well I was hoping to report for Mummy to go out for her meal with Karen Teale and her mum and for Daddy to have a good time at his unofficial Christmas Party. However, the Almera Tino got caught in traffic on the M25 and the driver reported that the engine was revving too high. It reached the 7,000 mark. Obviously something was amiss so pulled over to the hard shoulder by the M25 / M23 interchange and called the breakdown service.</p><p>Anyway the breakdown man only had to come from Clackett Lane a mere 10 miles away, tops. He went past us twice, each time going on to the M23 and having to do a massive motorway double U turn! 2.5 hours later and some very upset and hungry children in the car the recovery man came. He didn't want to attend to it there so recovered back to Clacket Lane where he deemed the car broke beyond repair. A tow home and almost an argument as they said recovery was for 10 miles only! We managed to sort that. Over 7 hours in a car / truck later the ordeal was over and we were home. As soon as the recovery man left us, Daddy tried the car out and it drove normally. No problems. This has however prompted Daddy to get us a new car.</p>

    <title>Jessica's Nativity Play</title>
    <info>
		<p>Jessica was a narator at her first Sandringham School Play. It was held at the baptist church where there was a large audience. She looked completely underwhelmed by the whole thing which made Mummy and Daddy laugh. Such a performer at home, and seemingly couldn't careless here. Still she read her two lines very well into the microphone. Well done Jessica.</p><p>In the evening Katie went out with her youth group to Camberley for a bite to eat and a go in the bowling complex. She has a far bigger social life than the rest of us put together I think. Ahhh saying that, Ben went to Jasper's lego party today also..... a theme inspired by Ben's effort I am told.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_12_21-06-JessicaNativityPlay.jpg</src><caption>The star narrator</caption></image>

		<p>It's been raining pretty non-stop for days now. Mummy left at 7am for shopping at the Meadows... and it was packed. She even had to queue up to get into the car park. Anyway the rest of us played games with Daddy. Daddy invented a new game up using the video camera on the phone. Katie and Ben made each there own Treasure Hunt type games.</p><p>Ma Ma and Pop Pop popped around and then we then did our own popping around to the Fars house for a cuppa. Ben went mad on the printer!</p><p>Last year we went as a family to Frankie and Bennies in Guildford, so we thought we'd keep this pre Christmas treat going and this time went to Camberley. The girls got all dolled up and we ate for England.

    <title>Christmas Eve</title>
    <info>
		<p>For once Daddy had Christmas Eve off work so we could all relax before the big evening. Everyone was excited. If I had to rank the whole Christmas spirit and excitingness it would definately have to be Katie first who has been very sweet and busy making and obtaining presents for everyone. She made Mummy and Daddy some quizes, pictures, stories, all sorts. Uncle Graham got a Rangers tea mat which were made from Hana Beads, Farfar got a diary. She seemed to get as much pleasure from giving as receiving the gifts. Katie showed the most amount of Christmas spirit possible. Ben was hoping for a Bat Cave. Jessica was mad as ever and I think was looking forward to the sweets and chocolate.</p><p>Just after lunch we headed over to the Kelley's for some pre-Christmas drinks which was nice. There were plenty of children to play with. James and Ben got on like a house on fire, and Amy Huggets was there so Jessica was happy and exhuberent as ever.</p><p>We left mid afternoon and entered the Danish Christmas zone. By this stage we were tracking where Father Christmas was in the world, Afghanistan. The children were cranked to the max in excitement, but first we had the Christmas meal. The roast pork was excellent, which Daddy and Jessica ventured into. It seemed Daddy hadn't eaten for a week! Mummy, Katie and Ben had sausages instead. It was nice that the children were more grown up and could fend for themselves a bit more.</p><p>Daddy won the Risalamande challenge and got a Chocolate Orange for his troubles. Finally after a game of Coppit we were allowed to light the candles on the tree and start opening presents. Not quite like how the Fars like it, Katie and Ben were dealing all the presents out quickly and lots were being opened. Farfar got the family book which Daddy had spent many, many hours on. Farmor got lots of 'heart' related presents.</p><p>We spent 45 minutes opening presents and ended with a nice cup of coffee and Katie and Ben had produced a lovely 12 page programme of a carol concert and readings. It was so lovely for us all to join them in singing some christmas carols. I think the Danish traditions were upheld for another year.</p><p>We got home for about 9pm, then Mummy had 2 hours of midnight mass. Daddy collapsed into bed.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_12_24-01-ChristmasEve.jpg</src><caption>Danish Christmas Dinner</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_12_24-35-ChristmasEve.jpg</src><caption>Carol Concert</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_12_25-44-ChristmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Carol Concert</caption></image>

    <title>Christmas Day</title>
    <info>
		<p>Katie found it hard to get a good nights sleep she didn't go to sleep initially until the early hours of the morning and constantly awoke which made it difficult for Father Christmas to pick his time to visit. Katie was getting stressed a bit knowing that she had to be asleep for him to visit. She was afraid he wouldn't come at all if she stayed awake.</p><p>The children reported they got up at 3:37 which sounds like Ben to me. Mummy and Daddy were woken at 5:45 at present opening began at 6am! Well Father Christmas didn't deliver exactly what we wanted. Close enough and we were happy enough. For Katie he delivered a Barbie Wardrobe, fashion glasses, makeup set, a Christmas outfit with shoes, Build a Bear clothes, pyjamas, gloves, a Barbie annual, sweetsand buble bath. Ben, a PSP, Build A Bear Clothes, Moshi Monster sticker album, war book, mouthwash, nuts, lego sticker book, lego watch and a red hoody. Jessica, Christmas outfit with shoes, chocolate lolly marker, Moshi Monster scooter, Build A Bear Clothes, lip balms, sweets, Sabrina Teenage Witch annual, hand gel, bubble bath, mp3 player and hoody.</p><p>Next was Mummy and Daddy who both didn't go overboard this year. We then moved down to the presents under the tree which has come from friends. We then went over to the Fars for Christmas Breakfast. We lay on the sofa and watched a film whilst the others opened presents. Mummy had gone to church.</p><p>We had the longest journey ever over to Gravesend. Two accidents, meant two long traffic jams, the last of which was right by the last junction, the Gravesend turn off on the A2. We were so close, Mummy, Katie and Ben decided they would get out and walk to Ma Ma's! They made the 0.75 mile trek along the stationary A2, past the police, down the sliproad and on to Wrotham Road. By this time Daddy and Jessica were moving again and were able to pick us up. At least we were able to stretch our legs and see the scenic A2 by foot.</p><p>The Elders arrived a few minutes before us and so the bedlem began. The children had their Christmas lunch which was over in a flash. Not many deserved the 'Finish Me' medal! We then went for a walk down to the rec then it was present opening time. There was great enthusiasm to be Father Christmas and distribute the persents from the tree. Each child had their pile and began opening. Wow what a lot of presents.</p><p>After a bit of play time and dinner it was soon bed time for us all, leaving the adults to tackle their monster sized Christmas Dinner and for them to open their presents. Last knockings was to try some of the new board games they got: Would I Lie To You was one of them. For the first time Ellie and Michael went home leaving the rest of us to fight for beds.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_12_25-18-ChristmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Friends Present Opening</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_12_25-41-ChristmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Christmas Breakfast</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_12_25-44-ChristmasDay.jpg</src><caption>Our Christmas Lunch</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 40: Basingstoke Canal, Dogmersfield</title>
    <info>
		<p>To blow a few cobwebs from ourselves we went off to first collect some Turkey soup from Pop Pop at the Fleet Services and then went on to Dogmersfield where we had a lovely walk along country roads, along a tranquil Basingstoke Canal, a lake, some farm animals and lots of mud. Most moaned how they didn't want to do the walk, but Daddy loved it and I think everyone needed some outdoor time. Of course Ben was told to be careful in the puddles and such like. Of course he found a very deep hole filled with water, which filled his boots!! Typical Ben.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_12_30-03-DogmersfieldWalk.jpg</src><caption>Dogmersfield Blow The Cobwebs</caption></image>

    <title>New Car, New Year Eve at Sanders</title>
    <info>
		<p>We picked up the new car today from Maidenhead. After the traumas from the past few months with the old Almera we've decided to upgrade, well to an 8 year old car. Things wrong with the old car. Dirty, denty, no fog lights, no CD player, wheel housing ripped out, heater control broken, heater directers broken, engine light on constantly, electric windows that sometime work, electric windows which just fall down, I could go on. Anyway we've taken bets when Mummy is going to first trash it!</p><p>In the evening we went over to the Sanders household to see the new year in. Jessica went to bed with Lily whilst the rest of us stayed up. Ben and Joey were predominently watching the DVD that Ben and Katie made. It had over 2 hours of photos and film. They watched the lot. For the adults there was some nice food and Michael had made an effort on making games.... although it was hard work with a mixture of 'Attention Deficit Delinquents' in tow, technical gremlins and the exciting guessing how much 6 eggs cost game! The Mr and Mrs game was solely for Karen and Rich.... question 3 was interesting!</p><p>Anyway we saw midnight in. Karen was dancing to early 90's dance music! Quite an atmosphere.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2012/2012_12_31-01-NewYearsEve.jpg</src><caption>The midnight crew</caption></image>

    <title>Alice Holt Walk With Wests - Car Ditched</title>
    <info>
		<p>The Wests arranged for us to go to Alice Holt with them for a nice walk in the mud. It was packed there, everyone had the same idea I think. The children were almost trying to get as muddy as possible!</p><p>When it came to leaving Daddy attempted the reverse the new car out of the mud so the rest of us could get in more easily. However, it was so muddy the wheels were spinning. In an attempt to get some traction, Daddy went forward and back at an angle. Mud was spraying everywhere. All Daddy could see was Mummy going absolutely beserk and almost having a nervous brakedown. Daddy had manouvred the  car into a hollow, some would say shallow ditch and the front bumper was embeded into the grass verge / bank. Daddy didn't know this and wondered why the car would no longer go forward. By this stage Mummy I think let the whole car park at Daddy's shortcomings. Daddy was stuck and had even taken off his boots which now sat 5 meters away from the car in an effort to keep everything clean inside.</p><p>Stunned, Daddy just sat in the car for about a minute not knowing what to do. A man came across an offered to help get it out. First Daddy had to step out into the mud to get his boots back on, and then address the helpful man. Eventually 6 or 7 blokes came to help, I think in sympathy for Daddy's earbashing that he received. After a bit of pushing the car came out easily. However there was a little bit of damage on the undercarraige which cost £10 to fix. Mummy was still not happy for a good long while! funny story though.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_01_01-07-WestWalk.jpg</src><caption>Glorious Mud</caption></image>

    <title>British Military Fitness, California Country Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>Auntie Charlotte came to stay this weekend and this morning her and Daddy went to try the British Military Fitness session down at Frimley Lodge Park. Both were being a bit farty about it. Nervous they were going to something out of their league. There were 60 or so people there ranging from 20's to 60's year olds. It was an hour ofalmost non-stop jogging, squat trusts, burpees, mountain climbs, etc. Both survived with aching muscles.</p><p>In the afternoon we drew lots on where we were to go. The winning ticket was a trip with the bikes around California Country Park. After circuling the lake we went on the playground assault course where Katie won and Ben got in a bad mood for losing!</p><p>In the evening we snuggled up to watch the film, Nativity.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_01_05-06-CaliforniaCountryPark.jpg</src><caption>Daddy and Charlotte Post Fitness Session</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_01_05-18-CaliforniaCountryPark.jpg</src><caption>California Country Park Walk</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_01_05-42-CaliforniaCountryPark.jpg</src><caption>Grump Guts</caption></image>

    <title>Snow, Spectrum Swim, Ellie Baby Shower</title>
    <first name="benjamin">Jump off 5m diving board</first>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went out to play in the snow. We took the sledges to the local fields and played on the smallest slopes in the world. Still we had it all to ourselves and we loved it. Daddy ended up pulling the three of us as quick as he could and made us all fall off!</p><p>In the afternoon we went to the Spectrum for a swim with the Elders and Ma Ma and Pop Pop. After singing happy birthday and a coffee we went into the relatively quiet pool. We had a great time on the slides and wave machine. We eventually made our way over to the diving boards to test our courage. We'd not done the 3.5m board before and although we just jumped off it, still we made it. Ben then went to the highest, 5m board. He chickened out at first, but after Daddy showed him the way, Ben did jump. With all our hearts in our mouths he surfaced unscathed. He was trembling with excitement at what he had just achieved. It made Daddy proud. It made Mummy not be there. She did not want to see it. Joey and Uncle Michael followed off the 5m platform as well. Ben had a total of 5 jumps off the top board. Katie had a look, but sence prevailed.</p><p>In the evening we went over to the Elders for Auntie Ellie's babyshower. We gave her a nappy cake and played games. Katie joined in whilst the rest of us went to bed.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_01_19-15-SnowDettingen.jpg</src><caption>Jessica racing down the hill, helped on by Katie</caption></image>

    <title>More Sledging - Woods</title>
    <info>
		<p>Some more woes with the car. The battery has died again which means another bail out from the Fars. This time they stopped by for a spot of tea.</p><p>In the afternoon Daddy, Ben and Jessica ventured into the woods, wrapped up well, armed with two sledges and a few square miles of hilly woods. They managed to get to four hills, steadily getting better each time. By the end, Daddy's heart was in his mouth as Jessica slid down a fast icey track so fast she lay down flat on the sledge not seeing where she was going! Luckily she did not hit anything, and she absolutely loved the thrill!</p><p>We stayed out till gone dark which was a bit of a worry in the dark. Mummy and Katie came out as a search party worried Daddy had a diabetic coma! I ask ya. Anyway all was well and snuggled in and watched Harry Potter in the evening.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_01_20-06-WoodsSledging.jpg</src><caption>Sledging siblings</caption></image>

    <info>
		<p>Last night Mummy and Daddy went out with the Wests for a nice meal down the Swan in Ash Vale. Auntie Charlotte came around to stay the night even though she'd worked a double shift and was tired. Too tired to join Daddy in the Park Run, which was extremely muddy. It was a close run thing between James and Daddy. James took an early lead. With 400m to go Daddy ran past Mr Ball quite strongly, however, James had a bit left in the tank for a sprint finish. Time: 26:55 for 5km.</p><p>Auntie Charlotte departed. The Teale's came over in the afternoon. Daddy and Baradley planned their WWII fort kayak run in Kent. Summer and Katie played like a dream with each other. They have very imaginitive minds when it comes to playing Barbirs with one another! They didn't go to sleep until well gone midnight!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_01_26-02-ParkRun.jpeg</src><caption>James beating Daddy in the Park Run.</caption></image>

Daddy was well impressed with Jessica's ability to swim only after two lessons. She must have done 5 metres. Hopefully with the rate of progression we'll have her out of armbands by the end of the year.</p><p>After we popped over to the Fars to see how they are doing and to wreck the joint as usual.</p>

You never know what is going on upstairs in there. Well it seems a bit. She is working with some year ones for a couple of subjects. The teacher seemed very happy with her. The only thing was confidence in doing the work. She always checks what she does with the teacher before getting on with it. She always has the right idea. Mummy and Daddy were very pleased and proud of number 3!</p>

    <title>Park Run, Mummy Haircut, Auntie Susan's and Elders</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy completed the ParkRun 15 seconds outside his best which was not very satisfying. However, he went out afterwards with the Balls for the ParkRun breakfast and was introduced the rest of the team.</p><p>Daddy bought mummy a booking at the hairdressers. Possibly the first haircut she has had for 3 or 4 years plus. Mummy was worried that if she had it cut short that'll Jessica would have nothing to cling onto. Still it didn't stop her. Ben said she looked beautiful when she came out. We all of course agreed.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_02_16-00-Haircut.jpg</src><caption>Before and After Haircut</caption></image><p>Whilst Mummy had her haircut the rest of us popped over to Auntie Susan's to have a drink and see the cats. Uncle Graham was at work. Later in the afternoon we were able to have another cuddle with Toby as the Elders came over for a cuppa.</p>

    <title>Walk 41: Pimlico Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we went over to the Fars where Daddy helped put up the fence in the back garden whilst mummy went to church.</p><p>We then went straight off to our walk which began with a bus journey from Sloane Square to Westminster, where mummy again lost us with Daddy. We then did wasted a bit of time seeing if the Florence Nightingale Museum was free. It was not. We overlooked Parliament from the south side of the Thames and ate our picnic. We saw the duck boat a few times which brought back memories of last years kayaking trip for Daddy and Katie!</p><p>We walked past Lambeth Palace and headed for an authenticate inner city swing park which we stopped at.</p><p>We crossed the river once more and continued west down towards Chelsea and Pimlico. We walked through the venue of the Chelsea Flower Show and into the National Army Museum. Jessica almost strangled herself on some string which she wrapped around her neck! Anyway she survived and enjoyed the War Horse exhibition, before we finally finished the 4.5 mile walk back at Sloane Square.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_02_17-09-PimlicoWalk.jpg</src><caption>Big Ben</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_02_17-15-PimlicoWalk.jpg</src><caption>Cruising in Chelsea</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_02_17-27-PimlicoWalk.jpg</src><caption>Army Museum</caption></image>

    <title>Sleepover mayhem</title>
    <info>
		<p>Each year Katie has a sleepover with friends who all started Frimley Green playgroup on the same day, namely: Natasha, Grace and Nina. You couldn't see the carpet in the front room they made so much mess. No Barbie's were played with, instead there were boxing gloves and a tablet computer. They watched films and Pop Girl till about 11pm - midnightish which is relatively early for a Katie sleepover.</p>

    <title>Deepcut Cycle Ride</title>
    <info>
		<p>For valentines day mummy got another walk book, much to the delight of the children! It contains 45 walks all in the area, not much more than a 10 miles journey from home. Today was local, starting off at the Basingstoke canal at the bottom of Deepcut. Jessica had been upgraded to Katie's old bike. Unfortunately there was only one brake and Jessica found it hard to squeeze. So there were a few hairy moments along the route. Once she raced off the hill, went over a branch at pace, wobbled, kept her balance but then slowed to a halt by riding into a steep bank! Ben ended up crying a couple of times. Once for going over the handlebars right at the start and secondly by getting stuck in a deep puddle and getting soaked! Typical Benjamin.</p><p>It was a lovely ride as we explored parts of Deepcut and Frimley Green we never had before. We finally ended up at the Canal centre in Mytchett and then back home. A 4 hour epic ride which was only 7 miles long!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_02_19-15-DeepcutBikeRide.jpg</src><caption>Hill Climb</caption></image>

    <title>Lunch With Ron</title>
    <info>
		<p>We don't see Ron that often and now that he finds it difficult to travel long distances we arranged to meet with the rest of the Gay family over in the Royal Saracens pub in Beaconsfield. Ron wanted to treat us all to lunch which was very generous of him.</p><p>We did very well considering we were there for 4 hours and not a lot to entertain us. Still Daddy had a nice chat with Great Uncle Ron, comparing diabetes notes, recalling stories about his Dad and other stuff. He's quite a laid back, easy to talk to character.</p><p>It was nice to see everyone together.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_02_22-05-RonLunch.jpg</src><caption>The Gay Family</caption></image>

    <title>Elders Spectrum Swim, PB in Parkrun, Joey and Katie swap sleepover</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy went off to do his parkrun and smashed his best time by almost 2 minutes. PB is now set at 24:05. He was very happy. As soon as he came back home we went over to the Spectrum and met the Elders for a swim. It was really busy there, so the queues were quite long. Still we had fun on all the things. We didn't manage the 5m diving board this time though.</p><p>We all came back to our house where Daddy did a fry up, without anything actually being fried. We swapped Katie for Joey who stayed over for the night. We also accrued Charlotte at Hotel Gay.</p>

    <title>Walk 42: Regents Canal Walk - Heathrow Pickup, Jessica sleepover</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had an early start as Charlotte came with us to Heathrow Airport to welcome back Ma Ma and Pop Pop from their New Zealand holiday. More importantly we were there to get our presents! However, we had to trade Jessica who went to stay at Ma Ma and Pop Pops for the night.</p><p>She luckily escaped not only the 5 mile run that Daddy and Charlotte later did, but also the long Regents Canal walk. There was a lot of traffic getting there and pretty cold outside. We even saw the odd flake of snow. Still not even the moaning from Katie and Ben detered Mummy, Daddy and Charlotte from the walk which commenced at Kings Cross station.</p><p>Ben, within 5 minutes fell off the scooter, hurt his hands and began crying. Oh dear. Still we made it to the canal and had a lovely walk along, popping off at Camden to go up and down the high street. There were plenty of people shopping and there were loads of market stalls selling food.</p><p>We continued past London Zoo and Little Venice before we all were glad to see the car at Warwick Avenue. As Mummy says: That's another ticked off. We missed Jessica lots with her happy face.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_02_24-03-RegentCanalWalk.jpg</src><caption>Camden High Street</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_02_24-09-RegentCanalWalk.jpg</src><caption>Happy Ben Over Regents Canal</caption></image>

    <title>Nuts Challenge - Brownie Thinking Day - Alice Birthday - House Viewing - Emma Sleepover</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning we parted three ways. Katie went off for a Brownie Thinking day, Mummy, Ben and Jessica went over to Meopham for Alice Teale's 5th birthday and Daddy went to do the Nuts Challenge in Dorking with his work colleagues.</p><p>Daddy was not too sure what to expect from the 7km course. The website listed 6 or 7 obstacles (including Hell River and Hamburger Hill) and so he thought it would be mainly a running event. How wrong he was. There must have been 10 obstacles in the first 500m, including getting very wet and muddy and climbing through underground steel tube tunnels, cargo nets, firemans poles, trenches, (freezing) river walking and at the end a neck high 100m walk/swim through a lake! Over 20 people got hypothermia, broken bones and even a helicopter airlift! Daddy finished in 350th out of over 900 competitors. 60 people attempted the 28km version and only 6 finished!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_03_02-16-NutsChallenge.jpg</src><caption>Nuts Challenge</caption></image><p>Later in the day Ma Ma and Pop Pop popped to visit, we also went to view a house in Frimley Green which we really liked. Katie's friend Emma came to stay the night.</p>

    <title>House On The Market - Again?</title>
    <info>
		<p>The Royal 'We' have decided to put the house on the market with a property agent. You pay them £250, they come around take pictures, get dimensions, etc and put it on all the popular house web sites. Much better than the £4000 for the estate agent fees. Anyway on Friday we have our first viewing. Lots of DIY for Daddy to do.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_03_09-01-HouseSale.jpg</src><caption>Advert</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_03_09-03-HouseSale.jpg</src><caption>Dimensions</caption></image>

    <title>RLC Museum, Marie Curie Collecting, Come Dine With Me - Benjamin</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy had done no training all week so was quite pleased with a sub 25 minute performance on a muddy Frimley Lodge Park track. As soon as he got home we went off with him to the RLC museum who were doing an event. We had a good time looking around. Mummy popped over to church for the lent lunch.</p><p>In the afternoon Mummy and Daddy had volunteered to rattle a collection tin for the Marie Curie at the Meadows. Ma Ma and Pop Pop came to save us so we didn't have to wait around for the two full hours.</p><p>Ben's turn for Come Dine With Me. His menu consisted of: Popadoms, Chicken Korma and Ice Cream inside a scooped out Orange. He showed a lot of enthusiasm for it and was proud of his final result. It was very nice. A lot of clean plates.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_03_09-02-BenComeDineWithMe.jpg</src><caption>Jessica Superstar</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_03_09-00-MarieCurieCollecting.jpg</src><caption>Marie Curie Collectors</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_03_09-00-RLCMuseum.jpg</src><caption>RLC Museum Fun</caption></image>

		<p>We got up early this morning and tried to make Mummy breakfast in bed. However, filling the kettle for the cup of tea we managed to flood half the kitchen. Worse still we switched the dripping wet kettle on and the fuse when for downstairs! Woops. After Croisants in bed, it was present and card opening time. It was chocolates all the way, along with some fine cards. We then put on a Mother's Day show on downstairs which included costumes, a stage, songs, poems and a little acting scene. It was very touching.</p><p>Later Daddy went for a 40km cycle ride with Nick and Martin, Katie and Ben went to Nina's bowling party, later in the afternoon Mummy and Jessica went to a nice hotel in Haselmere with the Barnett / Weston clan for Mother's Day tea and cake, whist Daddy, Katie and Ben went to the fars to play Coppit and Trains.</p>

		<p>Daddy went for his Parkrun and came back to pick us up and take us out whilst Mummy prepared for a house viewing, only to be told 5 minutes beforehand that the viewers had cancelled! Still there was another couple at 2pm. This pretty much ruined our day in terms of being able to go out and do something substantial. Daddy took us to Sandhurst Memorial park for a play. It was pretty cold.</p><p>We decided to fill the evening with the final contestent in the Come Dine With Me competition, Daddy. He spent 3 hours in the kitchen making, mini pizzas for starter, Sausage Plat and mash for main and Chocolate Ganache for pudding.</p><p>Then came the opening of the envelopes. In fifth place came Jessica, not helped with a score of 5 from Benjamin Alan Uhrskov! Fourth was Ben, Third Mummy, a sympathetic second for Daddy and Katie walks away with the £10 prize fund for first place!! Well done Katie.</p>

    <title>Walk 43: Greenwich and Sky Ride, Ben Parkrun</title>
    <info>
		<p>Continous promises for the participation in the 5km Parkrun was excused away week after week over the past 2 months. Now Benny Boy has stepped up and decided to take on the 3 mile challenge, a distance he's never even got close to running before. We weren't sure what to expect in terms of performance . Would he last 2 laps? What sort of time would he get? We met up with James and Duncan and we told Ben about the 10 run t-shirt. However, he'd have to complete 2 laps to register for this. This I think spurred him on. Daddy, Ben and James all ran together and it was difficult to gauge as Ben seemed like he could go faster whenever he wanted and didn't sweat at all dispite wearing his hoody! Anyway his trainers fell off twice, once near the finish line, he completed the course in 33:06 minutes and came 281 out of 309 runners. We were very proud and made Daddy's day.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_04_06-03-Parkrun.jpg</src><caption>Ben's First Parkrun</caption></image><p>Finally we had some blue skies, sun and no wind. Time for a walk then. We choose the Greenwich walk which starts at the O2, somewhere we've not been before. We parked up in Charlton and caught the bus in. We were impressed and excited at being at the O2. Mummy felt guilty that we've never taken us to see a concert or anything here. One day maybe. We circled the building and even saw people climb some stairs to the top! Wicked. Anyway we got to the Thames and headed west on our slightly wierd journey into Greenwich. We walked by heavt plant places, along the Blackwall Tunnel road and along some of the quainter, quieter streets. We stopped for a picnic outside the Cutty Sark pub which was much need by Jessica, before finally hitting the University Buildings. We wet inside our favourite Painted Hall. There are mirrors mounted on top of tea trollies so you can marval at the paintings on the ceiling. However, Jessica was marvelling at herself more I think and being silly.</p><p>After the chapel we entered the park and played on the swings. There were some more apparatus there now. It was a lovely sunny afternoon. We climbed the hills, and rolly pollied down some of them on our way to top and the observatory. There were loads of tourists there. What will it be like in the summer? We wound our way back dow n into town and Daddy had spotted his favourite Pie And Mash shop had reformed and relocated. This made his day. Goddards had ceased to exist in the past few years, the premises taken over by Gourmet Burger (yuk, Judas, errr), but happilly they sprung up again on the otherside of the shopping bit. We just had to go in and get some pies and a sausage roll. Thank goodness they were as good as ever. We then went in to the big sweet shop and fleeced mummy for some sweets before fighting our way through the market and over to the Cutty Sark. The first time we've seen it since it was restored. It had a strange glass bit around the bottom. When we peered through, there was an underground bit which meant you could effectively walk under the boat.</p><p>At the other end of the boat was a street peformer singing blues music and playing a harmonica and a steel, electric, slide guitar. This made Daddy's day now three times over. He was compelled to buy the chaps CD, which we all had to endure on the way home. Actually Ben said he liked it! Anyway back to proceedings. We had our race down the foot tunnel. Daddy, Katie and Ben ran down the steps quicker than Mummy and Jessica could go down in the lift. Once up the other side we got the DLR to Royal Victoria Dock. To end our planes, trains and automobiles trek we caught a 'flight' across the Thames in the cabel car which took us back to the O2. We loved it, although we were little embarrassed when Ben was saying he should take a bomb into our carriage! A fine 5 mile afternoon.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_04_06-17-GreenwichWalk.jpg</src><caption>Rolly Pollies Down Greenwich Park</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_04_06-24-GreenwichWalk.jpg</src><caption>The Gang In London</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_04_06-53-GreenwichWalk.jpg</src><caption>Flight Across Thames</caption></image>

    <title>Parkrun, Hoo Ness Kayak, Shorne Country Park</title>
    <info>
		<p>Busy day starting with the whole 5 of us starting the parkrun. Jessica went sprinting off and burnt herself out after 500m, which meant her and Mummy stopped. Katie, Daddy and Ben continued until we'd seen the others stopped after the mile mark and that point Katie felt she could go on no longer. That left the Boys to do another 2 miles on there own. The target was to beat last weeks time which they did by about a minute. 32:09 mins was there time which was fantastic. Ben certainly was panting hard around the course.</p><p>We headed straight off to Gravesend where Daddy went off with Ma Ma, Pop Pop and Bradley Teale to Gillingham for an adventurous Kayak trip around Hoo Ness. It's been Bradley's ambition for the past 6 years to actually go around the fort so we had good purpose to explore. First potential disaster overerted when the boot of our car slid up which pushed the kayak forward and almost on to the car parked in front. Just so happened Bradley was alert and thus saved a crash!</p><p>They set off towards Hoo Ness Island from Gillingham Strand at low tide which was not ideal. Bradley was a little unsure and found the choppy conditions a little unnerving at first. However he settled down and began to enjoy the scenary. There was quite a lot of rubbish which was quite noticable as they circumnavigated the north side of the island. After half an hour or so, the intrepid sailors looked for a landing spot close to the 150 year old fort. It was dificult as the tide was out which left a lot of mud flats. Finally they found a place, however they were beached 5 metres from dry land. Daddy took his boots and socks off and pulled the vesels in. The intention was for the others not to get wet or muddy. However, once landed they were met with plenty of sinking mud. Daddy foolishly treked off and didn't get too far before the sinking mud almost ate his boots! In an effort to help pretty much everyone fell over and lost footware! It was pretty funny really. After a wash down and a struggle they re-boarded their craft and continued past all the scuttle ships which were a great site.</p><p>A bay of oppotunity presented itself closer to the fort and this time they were able to land and reach ashore without too much bother. They stopped for some much needed Tomato soup which went down well as they were all begining to feel the chill. Daddy and Bradley went off to see if they could get inside the fort which was defended well with thick foiliage. Finally they did find the gangplank which went over the moat. However, it was sunken under water. At the same time they found the opening they could hear Gerry shouting for us quite loudly. What was wrong? Well luckily Carol and Gerry had stayed behind as the tide had quickly turned and came in. Gerry managed to move his Kayak up the beach and Carol was in the water holding Daddy's kayak. Thank goodness for the mother in law!</p><p>I think physical and mental strength was waining, that coupled with the weather drawing in meant the travellers were keen to get back to the mainland and get cleaned! The water was quite choppy with waves splashing on to the boats. 25 minutes of paddling ensured the safe return. It was a good adventure even if they didn't get inside Hoo Ness or the intended Darnet fort. Maybe another day.</p><p>Meanwhile the girls along with Benny stayed for lunch at the Teales and then went to Shorne Country Park. They went for a long walk to the mausoleum, a bit longer than expected which didn't thrill the kiddies, especially as it was raining. We finally all met up, went home and got a well deserved fish and chips for dinner.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_04_13-06-HooNessKayak.jpg</src><caption>Tomato Soup Never Tasted So Good</caption></image>

		<p>Mummy went on her own to church this morning. After an early lunch we trooped off to the Intech Science Centre where Katie had recently gone on a school trip. She had raved about it and coupled with a special Star Wars day we decided that it would be nice for all of us to experience it.</p><p>Everything was a hands on experience aimed for the children. It certainly kept us entrertained. Overtakes the science musueum. It was very good, capped off with a planetarium which we went in to.

    <info>
		<p>We were graced with the presence of the Elders this morning, starting with the Parkrun at Frimley Lodge. It was a fine, sunny day with a record attendance. We had a great run, Uncle Michael finishing first out of us lot in a time of 20:46, followed by Daddy on 24:36, then Mummy on 34:01 and Ben and Joey at 34:58. Well done all. We went back home for a play and a fry up.</p><p>In the afternoon Ben went to one of his best friend's, Yuraj's birthday party held again at Frimley Lodge. Meanwhile Farmor came around to pick us two girls up and took us over to Laleham to play on the swings, have a sneaky ice cream, then pick Farfar up from the football club. We met Ben back at the Fars and had some nice dinner and a couple of walks into the woods.</p><p>Mummy and Daddy just about coped without us and went to Hemel Hempstead to Lisa Dixon's 40th birthday party. They met Lynda and Alan of course and got chatting to Lynda's nephew and wife which was very nice.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_04_20-03-ParkrunElders.jpg</src><caption>The Boys Running</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_04_20-03-Toby.jpg</src><caption>Jessica and Toby</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_04_20-03-Lisas40th.jpg</src><caption>Going Out</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_04_20-18-Lisas40th.jpg</src><caption>David and Lisa</caption></image>

    <info>
		<p>Mummy and Daddy came to pick us up at the Fars. We got up at 6:15 much to the dismay of the Fars!</p><p>We bought some rather expensive tickets to see the Horrible History performance at GLive, Guildford theatre. Ben had just completed a project in the Tudors and was well into thrm and the horrible histories adaptation of them. So we went.</p><p>It was great and something for us to all learn. Certainly Mummy and Daddy learnt stuff. It was worth it.</p><p>In the afternoon Ben went with the Beavers for a St Georges day church parade with Mummy.</p><p>Just a note to say that Ben came top of his Maths class and got 20 out of 20 in a mental arithmatic test. Basically top of his year and some of the bighter students of the year above. Well done Ben.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_04_21-02-HorribleHistories.jpg</src><caption>Horrible Histories</caption></image>

		<p>In the morning the Elders came over for another dose of the Parkrun. Daddy managed to get his best 5km time of 23:38.</p><p>Ben was being shipped off with the Beaver colony down to Drusillas. Apparently that is the closest place to see a Beaver. He really enjoyed himself as they played the animal olympics.</p><p>Meanwhile the rest of us went up to Kerry'd house in Colcester to surprise Auntie Christine for her 60th birthday. It was nice to visit her and Simon's house. It looked really good, especially Simon's partition in the garage: A mini pub. A great BBQ.</p><p>In the evening Katie and Jessica joined their cousins for a sleepover at Ma Ma and Pop Pops.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_04_27-02-Christines60th.jpg</src><caption>The Dog Inn</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_04_27-11-Christines60th.jpg</src><caption>Toby and Betsy</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_04_27-13-Christines60th.jpg</src><caption>Birthday girl</caption></image>

    <title>Elder BBQ, Sleepover</title>
    <info>
		<p>Frimley Lodge was hosting the Surrey Heath Fair so they cancelled the Park Run which gave us a chance to try somewhere new. We hopped down to Alice Holt where Daddy, Katie and Lily all treked around the gruelling up and down 5km course. After an initial fall Lily blasted in at 35 minutes, whilst Katie stormed off on the second lap returning a minute quicker.</p><p>After we went onto the Elder household and had an afternoon of BBQ fun coupled with the Glidewells. We had a good time. We swapped Katie and Joey for the night.</p><p>When we got back home, Daddy started a marathon 4 hour fire in the BBQ in an attempt to burn all the old fence panels. There were some big flames. Katie, Joey and Jessica all worked as a team: Smashing up the fence, breaking up the wood into bite sized burnable chunks and of course the fireman (or lady) who was feeding the dragon.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_04-06-EldersBBQ.jpg</src><caption>One is in her element</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_04-25-EldersBBQ.jpg</src><caption>Having a laugh</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_04-36-EldersBBQ.jpg</src><caption>Twisted Firestarter</caption></image>

    <title>Frimley Park Hospital 10km Run, Swindon Hotel</title>
    <info>
		<p>The big day had arrived for Daddy. He has spent the last month aiming for this event. Two training runs during the week, 2 bike to work and back a week, plus the parkrun and eating better was all to get a good time today. First up was Ben running in the fancy dress, 2.5km run. He dressed as a clone trooper and was interviewed pre-race. Ben completed the course inside 15 minutes and he said it was easy!</p><center><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ApsGyzKuHek?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ApsGyzKuHek?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="385" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></center><p>Ben's Interview Pre Race</p><p>Next up Daddy. He was running with James, Duncan and Richard. The third of these people didn't do too much training so was trailing a little to start with. The Ball brothers on the other hand hit the start hard. Daddy was able to keep up, although he was running his own race so didn't use them as pacemakers at all.The first hill hit at 3km and Daddy's slender lead over the Ball's had been quickly irradicated, as expected as he's not clever on the up hill. Still as soon as the downhill came, at about 4 or 5km Daddy re-took the lead. Daddy kept it strong, passing Farfar a couple of times and then saw us lot on the final bend. What Daddy was not expecting was a 'come on Duncan'. Daddy always faded at the end and Duncan was strong. However, Friday night's drinks caught up with him and he was sick all along the path. Great! Daddy pushed hard and finished in a very pleasing time of 47:40. A PB by a long shot.</p><center><object width="480" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5IMMEYC9-4E?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/5IMMEYC9-4E?version=3&amp;hl=en_GB" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="385" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></center><p>Daddy finishing</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_05-02-FrimleyPark10km.jpg</src><caption>Daddy finishing in 47:40</caption></image><p>We quickly gobbled a poor attempt at BBQ'ed roast pork, before our nightmare jorney to Swindon.</p><p>We were as usual in a rush to leave and Daddy had forgotten his diabetes kit. So we had to turn back at Bracknell. Mummy popped in and got the stuff. We then only realized that she hadn't brought needles or the Humalog pen. This time we got as far as Ascot and turned back. On the third time of asking we got all the kit. We were an hour and a bit late!</p><p>We arrived at the Marriott, met with the Elder, reunited with Katie and went straight to the room. 5 beds! It's never happened before. Always enough for 4, never 5. We soon trotted down to the swimming pool for a long swim, sauna, jacuzzi and steam room. This made us have a large appetite, so went to McDonalds for the kids and the smallest chip shop ever for the grown ups. We had one last chance to squeeze in another swim session before bedtime.</p>

It was a gloriously sunny day so made the most of it by going to Lydiard Park where we played on the swings and walked down to the pond and saw a massive mansion. We had a great weekend with the Elders who we wish to thank for making it all possible.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_06-14-SwindonHotelWeekend.jpg</src><caption>Lydiard Park</caption></image><p>After we went off to the Factory outlet where daddy bought a shirt for work, then made the sleepy journey home.</p>

		<p>The morning saw the boys go off to the home parkrun. Conditions were good and both smashed their PB's. Ben came in an amazing 28:15, whilst Daddy crossed the finish line in 22:36. Ben, as were we all, was very proud of his achievement.</p><p>After some homework action, we all went off to Coral Reef for swimming. It was packed. Still we all had a go on the flumes. The quick one was very quick. Mummy and Daddy could barely breath or see. Ben loved it of course. We saw the Elders, Westons and Barnetts who joined us in there. After Daddy went home to watch the FA Cup final with Barrie and James. He also did a scrummy BBQ. Meanwhile the rest of us went to the cinema to watch the film: All Stars. Ben gave it 8.5 out of 10.</p><p>Felicity stayed over for the night. She played very well Katie. They played board games, watch films and ate sweets. They also prepared a show for the next family gathering.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_11-10-Parkrun172.jpg</src><caption>28:15 - 5km</caption></image><p>Managed to set up Jon Barker from work with Charlotte!

After we came back home to do homework, before going to Jessica's summer school fete at Sandringham School. Mummy was on the tattoo stool whilst Daddy was on wobbly bikes. The Fars and Ma Ma and Pop Pop joined us and helped contribute to the spending! Ben of course came back with 7 new teddy bears from the teddy tombola. We then had a third local event down at the Scout hut. The atmosphere was so nice and the leaders work so hard to make sure the boys had a good time with all the challenges they had laid out. We stayed and supported the AGM.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_18-06-Fetes.jpg</src><caption>Farmor looking on to a mad wobbly biker</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_18-16-Fetes.jpg</src><caption>Benny the balancer</caption></image>

    <title>Day 1: Bike London to Newhaven</title>
    <info>
		<p>I decided last summer that I fancied biking from London to Paris. I organised it myself with the help of my fellow L2P'ers; Nick and Steve. I used the excellent Donald Hirsh website which had many of the routes and suggested hotels that we used.</p><p>We had done some training and Steve has been in and out on some parts of the route. His injuries had subsided enough for him to attempt the whole lot. The starting point was Westminster bridge for a 9am departure. Mum and Dad kindly took me to London, whilst the other two got the train from Reading.</p><p>Luggage was a major issue. We shared some bits. I bought a rucksack the day before as the ones we had were not big enough. The others brought panniers.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_29-00-Day1-LondonToNewhaven.jpg</src><caption>Route</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_29-03-Day1-LondonToNewhaven.jpg</src><caption>Starting from Westminster Bridge</caption></image><p>We got a couple of photos before first heading in the opposite direction to Newhaven. We trundled to Parliament Square, through Victoria and onto Chelsea where we stopped for a photo outside Stamford Bridge. We then got a bit lost and made slow progress. We met with Michael close to the M25 and headed continued south with high spirits..... Then the rain came so we decided to stop at the top of Turners Hill at the pub for some much needed lunch.</p><p>The rain persisted and the next hour or so was just getting miles under the belt. We got closer to Lewes and we all bolted off, leaving poor Steve behind...... with a puncture. Luckily he managed to contact Michael who kindly went back to sort him out! Meanwhile Nick and I went to Newhaven Lodge where we were greeted by an unfriendly Chinaman. It was a typical B and B.</p><p>We freshened up and went out to a run down Newhaven. It was a pretty depressing place to live. We had a beer in the pub before moving on to the Hotel for some din dins. I fell behind on the drinking steaks. Slept well.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_29-07-Day1-LondonToNewhaven.jpg</src><caption>End Of Day Beer</caption></image>

    <title>Day 2: Bike Newhaven to Forges Les Eaux</title>
    <info>
		<p>We woke to a very grey day outside. We tucked into breakfast, got supplies and said our goodbyes to Michael who was riding 100km along the South Downs to Alton.</p><p>At 10am, we boarded the ferry which was quite exciting, locking our bikes up to a transport container. I was pretty tired and wanted a sleep. However, Steve introudced a new card game which kept us entertained for a while. Nick spent a good few hours attempting to fix his pump which had mysteriously broken over the last day.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_30-06-Day2-DieppeToForgesLesEaux.jpg</src><caption>Ferry - Bikes in background</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_30-00-Day2-DieppeToForgesLesEaux.jpg</src><caption>Route</caption></image><p>We got into Dieppe with the weather being a little brighter. We duly presented our passports and negotiated riding on the right hand side of the road at a bit of a struggle at first. By now it was 4pm and we had a good 35 miles to do, so wanted to make good progress. We soon picked up the Avenue Vert which basically was a cycle path along a disused railway line. There was a slight incline all the way to our destination. We remarked how peaceful and nice the scenary was and how few riders we met. Very country. No cars.</p><p>It was interesting to see how we would fair after the long ride yesterday. We certainly weren't the freshest. The ride was getting a bit monotonous in the end. Same path, same scenary. Nick, with 2 miles to go decided to spice it up by getting our second puncture! The spare inner tube did not fit the pump properly so Nick decided to patch up the existing one. We left the Avenue Vert path and headed into the town of Forges Les Eaux.</p><p>We found the hotel easily enough. It was the first time we had to put on our best Del Boy french as the receptionist did not (want to) speak English. We were given keys to the garage to lock our bikes. Dawg produced the biggest, heaviest lock you could imagine. Noone was going to take our velo's. I found that Michael had sneaked a teapot into my bag from Newhaven Lodge which was kind of him! We used it in order to make the Farnborough Rockets (Rego) Tea.</p><p /><center><p>Farnborough Rockets Cup Of Tea</p><iframe width="560" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0lmqxzBXv-M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></center><p /><p>The room was functional, but in order to squeeze three of us in they'd put in a childs camp bed in. Who was going to get the bum deal here? Nick was quite worried about the lack of puncture strategy kit, so wandered around the seemingly dead town at 8pm looking for bike shops. We gave up on that idea and decided to eat some French food for the first time in a Chinese!</p><p>The meal was excellent, although I was well behind on the drinking front. We still had not decided which of us would be unlucky enough to sleep in the small bed. We had a coin toss comp. Yes I came last so had to take the camp bed.</p>

    <title>Day 3: Bike Forges Les Eaux to Villennes Sur Seine</title>
    <info>
		<p>Today I consider as the main cycling day. It started slowly as we stocked up on food and cycle repairs. Nick had almost lost his arm in attempting to pump his tyre up. It wasn't until 11am until we seriously set off over the rolling hills down to Gournay En Bray. It was good to stop at the 15 mile marker for our first patisserie experience. Mmm. It was good. They know how to do pastry these french dudes.</p><p>Despite been told the weather was going to be bad by a scouser at breakfast time, it was overcast and a little cold, but at least there was none of the wet stuff. During the early stages of the 75 mile ride we stuck together and stopped off at some really nice places. The roads were quiet, the scenary filled with fields.</p><p>Mid afternoon the shackles were lost and I shot off at a good pace for 5 or 6 miles at first. Then we saw the 20km sign to Marines and again decided to see if I could push the pace on for myself. We all nervously agreed this was the best bit of the trip so far where we rode alone with our mp3 players in. We stopped for a patisserie in Marines. Gorgeous. We had 20 miles to go and Steve was struggling a bit so decided to club together again. We had a few dodgey detours. The route guided us on to a dual carriageway where cars were going past us at 70mph!</p><p>We meandered through some more built up villages and finally at the top of a massive hill we reached the best hotel so far, Campanile.</p><p>We spruced up and went back into Villennes Sur Seine, a pretty town, to get some drinks. There was nowhere to eat, so walked back up to the hotel and demolished the buffet styled dinner!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_31-00-Day3-ForgeLesEauxToVillennes.jpg</src><caption>Route</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_31-10-Day3-ForgeLesEauxToVillennes.jpg</src><caption>Nice Village With Big Church</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_05_31-19-Day3-ForgeLesEauxToVillennes.jpg</src><caption>End Of Day Vin Rouge</caption></image>

    <title>Day 4: Bike Villennes Sur Seine to Paris</title>
    <info>
		<image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_06_01-00-Day4-VillennesToParis.jpg</src><caption>Route</caption></image><p>We started the day having bright blue skies for the first time for a long while. It was gorgeous. We tucked in customary style into a large 'eat as much as you like breakfast'. We began what we thought would be a gentle 30 mile ride into Paris. It was nice to get out of the fields scenary and more into towns where the life was.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_06_01-03-Day4-VillennesToParis.jpg</src><caption>Setting off from Hotel Campenile</caption></image><p>We must have done 2 miles before we had a half an hour stop so Steve could pick up some suncream and a hanger from a market place!</p><p>The ride was mainly off road, sometimes on a gravelly path through the woods, some tarmac path. There were a couple of hills to please us all. We made a point at saying 'bonjour' to oncoming riders, and only 2 out of about 15 begrudingly returned a compliment. They're an unfriendly bunch.</p><p>We had some busy 70mph dual carriageways to negotiate where Nick's lights fell off his bike. Steve and I lost him for a bit but stopped at Versailles Gardens for him. However, Nick glided past without hearing the bellowing boys. Passers-by were laughing. Eventually we met up at a big statue in the middle of a roundabout.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_06_01-52-Day4-VillennesToParis.jpg</src><caption>Statue at Versailles</caption></image><p>The ride was surpisingly a peaceful one through various parks. We had our first sight of Paris itself at Parc de Saint Cloud. We stopped off for a viewing and a drink before continuing over the River Seine.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_06_01-64-Day4-VillennesToParis.jpg</src><caption>Adonis</caption></image><p>I wanted to detour to go to Roland Garros, especially as the French Open was on this week. They managed to see a Russian woman tennis player, but we do not know who it was.</p><p>Riding along park land again we were 5 miles from the hotel at this stage. We came across a car parked up on the side of the road. She looked like a hooker. Cleaning the inside of her car down. Something very dubious happened there. Still we got a photo just in case we needed to provide evidence!</p><p>We stopped off at another top notch patisserie for some lunch. Super high quality. We rolled up the hill to the iconic Arc De Triomphe. I set the challenge to cycle around the 10 lane roundabout. Steve didn't fancy it, he instead got accosted by beggars who had a curious scheme which we still cannot work out. They would drop a ring in front of you making it seem that it was yours. They would then try and give it to you. Then What? Dumbfounded.</p><p>After cicrcling the Arc a few times, we headed down the very bumpy, cobble stoned Champs-Elysee. We were making slow progress in the traffic. Still this is what it was all about. Don't know how the Tour De France riders handle it on their road bikes at speed. They must need a chiropodist by the end. By now we just wanted to get to the hotel and freshen up and dump the bags.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_06_01-100-Day4-VillennesToParis.jpg</src><caption>Champs Elysee</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_06_01-110-Day4-VillennesToParis.jpg</src><caption>Riding Down The Champs Elysee</caption></image><p>We were in the Chopin Suite on the top floor. I had the choice of beds this time.... and took the double. The bathroom was the size of the kitchen diner at home, and it had jets squirting stuff from the sides.</p><p>The boys were out on the town. First stop was a beer at the end of the road, then a walk to the Sacre Cour, where Steve made friends again with beggars and was called 'strong man' as he tried to get away from the grabbing man. We went in the impressive, grand cathederal. The views were magnificant. Steve was gasping for a beer. After doing a few laps we ended up in a bar opposite the Moulin Rouges for a 20 euro round of alcohol much to my disgust.</p><p>Sitting in the sun watching the world go by on the street was very nice. After a frogs legs dinner we hit the metro and waited to see if Steve was going to deliver the promised 'good night out'. He researched by googling 'Where Single Girls Hang Out Paris'. Brilliant. Only the Dawg. We were worried at first as there wasn't too much around, and then we hit Rue Oberkampf. This was very busy. We hit a bar and convinced Steve to climb the stairs that led to the ceiling. Doh!</p><p>We then went to '114' which had dancing..... a dancing Steve and I. There was a dj spitting out euro music. Nick was not a dancer and so went off for an explore.... and not seen again by the other two for another3 hours! He got lost.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_06_01-25-Day4-VillennesToParis.jpg</src><caption>Out for the night. Me and Kingster</caption></image><p>Steve and I decided to walk and partially run back to the Hotel. On the way we got a kebab and were approached by prostitutes! Paris at 3am was busier than it was at 3pm strangley enough. There were loads of bars which had massive queuses outside. It was 3am.</p><p>Meanwhile Nick, who had lost his map, not remembered a phone charger or the name of the hotel was lost! He followed others to the 'centre' where ever that was, but soon lost them. Not sure on the order of these events, but he trod in dog poo, attempted to help a man who was worse for wear, then was sick over Nick's shoes (he had no socks on either). Yuk. He also needed the toilet! Still worse was to come after he eventually found the hotel and began to wash the sick out. After settling down and getting some much needed sleep, Steve decided to hop into Nicks bed and 'spoon' him. Nick, startled, told Steve politely to bugger off. The shock on Steve's face was a picture. This happened again!</p><p>Great day.</p>

    <info>
		<p>After another big breakfast we decided to lay off the beers and go sightseeing. Again the weather was perfect. We literally done a lap of Paris. The roads were quiet. Sights included: Hotel De Ville, Notre Dame, Invalides, Eiffel Tower and again the Champs-Elysee.... Oh did I mention we stopped for a patisserie.</p><p>On our way back to the hotel we stopped to get gifts and even had a McDonalds before boarding the stress-free EuroStar back to Kings Cross. The journey took 2:15 hours. We played cards for most of the journey home.</p><p>Mum and Dad picked me up from the station and drove me home whilst the others had to cycle to Paddington, catch a train, then cycle home. Total mileage: 222 miles.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_06_02-00-Day5-ParisSights.jpg</src><caption>Route</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_06_02-34-Day5-ParisSights.jpg</src><caption>Invalides</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_06_02-81-Day5-ParisSights.jpg</src><caption>Tour Eiffel</caption></image>

They set off as soon as Daddy got home from work. They stopped off at Sainsburys for a few snacks, then made the longish walk to the Ageas Bowl in Hedge End, Southampton where Hampshire play. In the queue we saw Leah Rushforth which was nice. The weather was good and we settled down to watch some cricket. Katie was taking it all in and enjoying the atmosphere. Overall we sat in 5 different places within the ground. Katie was taken by the hot tub bath which was wierdly placed by the boundary with a load of teenagers dipping inand out. Katie also took a lot of action shots of the cricket. We had a lovely time, although cannot help feeling the attraction was a lot to having a late night!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_06_26-03-HampshireCricket.jpg</src><caption>In the stands</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_06_26-07-HampshireCricket.jpg</src><caption>Overlooking the Ageas Bowl</caption></image>

There were loads of big trucks and guns which was right up Reuben's street. We also went on the inflatable assault course, a go in the parachute, played noughts and crosses with a deep sea diver, went on the fun house and some other fast fun fair ride. We also had a couple of go's on the grenade course and finally the older children tackled the rope across the water challenge. A favourite by far.</p><p>We returned back, had some cold drinks and ice lollies, before everyone had to return home.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_07_06-04-RLCArmyShow.jpg</src><caption>The RLC Revellers</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_07_06-10-RLCArmyShow.jpg</src><caption>Jessica and Yasmin watching Katie traverse the rope</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_07_06-49-RLCArmyShow.jpg</src><caption>Dave and Reuben driving in the desert</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_07_06-61-RLCArmyShow.jpg</src><caption>In the middle of being swung about</caption></image>

		<p>We always wonder how Jessica fairs at school as it is so hard to get her to take anything seriously or concentrate for more than 2 minutes. However, her school report was a pleasant surprise to us all.</p><p>She exceeded in all aspects of Personal, Social and Emotional development. The teacher commenting: Jessica has an excellent attitude towards behaviour and fully understands the difference between right and wrong. She is a good role model to others with her eagerness to learn and achieve. Jessica has been a pleasure to teach.</p><p>Well I never. Pick me up from the floor. Well done Jessica.</p>

    <title>Daddy's 38th Birthday, Ben starring in School Play</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy was awoken with croisants in bed. A treat in this household. He opened his presents which comprised of cycling tops, a bottle, book and magazine, a shirt, t-shirt, vouchers, cash and a beautifully crafted mug with all our hands prints on.</p><p>Ben and Katie had each made a loaf of bread as well which Daddy used in his sandwiches. It didn't matter that it was very soggy and undercooked, Daddy still proudly showed off his lunch to his work colleagues.</p><p>The fars popped over with their presents in the evening and stayed for a nice cup of tea.</p><p>Ben had been practicing for the past 6 weeks on his 100 lines in the school play. He managed to land the role of Tex, the sherrif of the wild west town. It was in the two main parts of the whole show and we and he were nervous before the performance.</p><p>There was no need for the nerves as he played his part brilliantly. He was expressive, passionate and loud enough for us to hear him. The rest of the family had queue for an hour to ensure we had the best seats in the house. We were so, so proud of him. Well done Ben. Unfortunately we were not allowed to take any picture of videos of him during the performance. Such a shame as his stetson hat was massive and almost looked like a sombrero.</p>

    <title>Parkrun, Silent Pool, House Viewing, Aldershot Lido</title>
    <info>
		<p>Uncle Michael joined us at the Frimley Lodge Parkrun this morning. It was blisteringly hot even at 9am. Anyway Daddy improved on his PB time and now down to 22:21 for 5km.</p><p>After freshening up we decided not to go to Bournemouth as we thought the roads and beach would be just so packed that it wasn't worth it. So instead we went to visit the Silent Pool which is just the otherside of Guildford. We couldn't get over how clear the water was despite all the wildlife, algy and people swimming in the pond. We walked around and found a nice spot to have our picnic. Us kiddies went and played in the water.</p><p>We returned back to Frimley Green in the early afternoon so we could go and visit a house that Mummy was keen for us to do. There was an open day on the house in Milden Close, just around the corner from Great Grandma. The house was very spacious and quite a bargain we thought for the price. Anyway mummy and daddy put an offer in there and then. We'll have to see how that fairs.</p><p>We wanted to continue the water theme, even if we weren't going to Bournemouth. So decided on the Aldershot Lido. Well it was packed there. 1500 others had the same idea. We queue for about 45 minutes before we even got in. Still we had a great time all 5 of us playing together and going on the flumes. Good times.</p><p>In the evening Mummy, the dirty stop out, went out clubbing at Lakeside Country Club for Silvi's 40th birthday celebrations.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_07_13-05-SilentPool.jpg</src><caption>Katie rooted</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_07_13-11-SilentPool.jpg</src><caption>The ever so Silent Pool</caption></image>

    <title>Olympic Park Run</title>
    <info>
		<p>We left in early in the morning to go up to the Olympic Park where we met other Park runners. Daddy had entered the National Lottery 5 mile run which wound its way around the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park.</p><p>Daddy actually ran with James, Duncan and Lee. The end of the race finished with a three quatres of a lap around the stadium, where many were watching and supporting. Fortunately we mananged to pick Daddy out and vice versa. The last 80 yards turned into a sprint. A great day.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_07_21-03-OlympicNationalLotteryRun.jpg</src><caption>Outside the olympic park</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_07_21-08-OlympicNationalLotteryRun.jpg</src><caption>Kit Kat waiting for Daddy in the stadium</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_07_21-23-OlympicNationalLotteryRun.jpg</src><caption>About to run</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_07_21-12-OlympicNationalLotteryRun.jpg</src><caption>200 yards to go</caption></image>

    <title>Ben's 8th Birthday</title>
    <info>
		<p>Ben started the day by opening lots of presents. From the family he got a new mountain bike, an Android tablet and copious amounts of Lego sets. In fact he got so many lego sets from everyone. It was almost an exclusive deal!</p><p>In the afternoon he had a Lego party. About 10 friends were invited. It was pretty raucous and one of the boys spoilt it a little with his bad behaviour. Anyway Ben had a nice time. His friend Theo then stayed for a sleepover.</p>

    <title>Denmark Holiday: Jessica's First Flight - Rosenborg</title>
    <info>
		<p>We started the day very early. Dad's alarm went off at 3:15am. It took a bit of an effort to rally the troops at first, but everyone fell into order by half past. After gulping breakfast and of course stuffing the last few essentials into the suitcase we embarked in the 4am darkness, needing to quieten the kiddies down before they woke the whole street in their excitement. Tight wad Daddy wasn't prepared to spend $80 on parking at the airport, so devised a scheme which invlolved looking at street view and the local bus timetables for 5am in the morning! We cruised through Gatwick, changed some money, bought books, and then looked at the departure boards only to notice that our gate had closed! Oh no. The sprint was on. Was the gate a million miles away as it always tends to be? No, fortunately. They were still queueing to board.</p><p>This was Jessica's first ever plane journey. Mummy was still nervous, but the rest of us coped fine. Luckily the weather was good, not much cloud cover and the window seaters coud get a nice view of southern England.</p><p>Less than 2 hours later we landed and made our way to the central railway station where our hotel Astoria was situated. We dumped our bags and walked through the city centre stopping off at the newly opened Hamley's to scout around. There were many activities and a large range of lego sets to look at which pleased Ben, who is well into it at the moment. We were finally prized away and made our way to the Kings Garden where we played in the sandpits. The weather was gorgeous and there were a lot of students socializing. We popped around Rosenborg Castle before catching a bus for a weary troops to the Opera House at the edge of Christainhavn. The estuary was looking lovely and blue in the sunshine.</p><p>We headed back to the hotel room, which was nice and spacious, via Hamley's to spend Ben's birthday money on a $80 lego set which he desperately wanted. We had an early night in our hot, top floor room.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_07-01-Denmark-Day1-Airport-Rosenborg.jpg</src><caption>Waiting for the bus at 5am in Horley</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_07-10-Denmark-Day1-Airport-Rosenborg.jpg</src><caption>Hans Christian Anderson meet the Gays</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_07-28-Denmark-Day1-Airport-Rosenborg.jpg</src><caption>Opera House</caption></image>

    <title>Denmark Holiday: Walk Copenhagen</title>
    <info>
		<p>What a contrast in the weather. It was very gloomy with some showers coming in. We had a walking day today which really pleased the children! We did plonk in a few trips to the park on the way around. We started by walking around Tivoli, Christiansborg Palace, Kongens Nytorv where we decamped into Magasin, which is a huge posh department store and played in the toy department before commiting a cardinal sin by visiting McDonalds for lunch. I know, its shocking. The rain had subsided and we continued onto the picturesque Nyhavn where we saw the royal band march through the streets, the Royal Palace (Amalienborg), the Gefion Fountain, the Kastellet Fort and of course the Little Mermaid. A lot of walking so far, and the weather was inclement. We had still plenty more walking to do. Across to two parks. The first was Østre Anlæg where we played loads in the playground. Next was Fælledparken Park which was very cool; from the tower playground, to the biggest skate park you'll ever likely to see and the traffic playground where a mock road system was been created with real traffic lights and road crossings. We had a great time playing all over this park. We were dead on our feet. We caught the bus back to Nørreport and stopped in an excellent Pizzaria that Katie especially loved. We packed in a lot of sights and good parks today. We slept well!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_08-06-Denmark-Day2-WalkCopenhagen.jpg</src><caption>Zig Zag Walk</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_08-15-Denmark-Day2-WalkCopenhagen.jpg</src><caption>Laura loving Lego</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_08-22-Denmark-Day2-WalkCopenhagen.jpg</src><caption>Girls at Nyhavn</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_08-34-Denmark-Day2-WalkCopenhagen.jpg</src><caption>Fountains outside the Royal Palace</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_08-49-Denmark-Day2-WalkCopenhagen.jpg</src><caption>Gefion Fountain</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_08-57-Denmark-Day2-WalkCopenhagen.jpg</src><caption>Mermaids and Merman</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_08-62-Denmark-Day2-WalkCopenhagen.jpg</src><caption>TV Show</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_08-68-Denmark-Day2-WalkCopenhagen.jpg</src><caption>Go play with the traffic</caption></image>

    <title>Denmark Holiday: Islands Brygge</title>
    <info>
		<p>We have found a reasonably priced supermarket at last for our breakfast. The now legendary Rema 1000. Fantastic value compared to Irma. Top travel tip that. Anyway after our morning routine we headed into town again this time searching for Ørstedsparken, another park. We finally arrived going the scenic route. We have been so impressed with the parks in Copenhagen. They are all completely different. This one is actually supervised and managed as it has a lot of play equipment such as trikes and scooters. There was even a table football game which was good, as all 5 of us joined in. A small thing like that is just a nice memory of our holiday. We spent almost a couple of hours there before returning to the hotel for a spot of lunch and to pick our swimming gear up. Next stop Islands Brygge.</p><p>We of course walked there which took us half an hour. The weather was good and the lido was busy. It had some diving platforms from a carved ship's hull. We loved it, especially Jessica, a real water baby. She lasted longer than any of us. Some of us had a go of the diving platforms. None of us where particularly brave on that front. It was a really good setup. The coldness set in a bit which put us off from staying in too long. After a spot of sunbathing, we got changed and walked south along the water's edge. We stopped off to watch a game of kayak polo. Looks like they were having a lot of fun playing that game, although some foul play was at hand. All in good humour and spirit though. We continued till one of the new bike bridges which we crossed to Fisketorvet.</p><p>We caught a train out to Flintholm, then the Metro back into town where we splashed out on a Jensens Bøfhus meal. Ben loved this meal. Best ever he reckoned.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_09-04-Denmark-Day3-IslandsBrygge.jpg</src><caption>Parklife</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_09-13-Denmark-Day3-IslandsBrygge.jpg</src><caption>Islands Brygge Lido</caption></image>

    <title>Denmark Holiday: Parkrun - Zoo</title>
    <info>
		<p>We started by searching for the Parkrun in Amagar Faelled. The park has to be 4 square miles so Daddy was stressing a bit in order to find it in time for the traditional 9am start. We were greeted with others who were also attending and met up with a couple of other English families who were running. We didn't set the world alight, but the course was very nice and we got the same warm, friendly atmosphere as we do in Frimley Lodge.</p><p>After the boiling hot run we bussed it over to Copenhagen Zoo. Mummy remembered from her previous trip how good it was and was not dissapointed this time either.  One of the first things up was the polar bear enclosure. We could go underground and see them playing under the water. It was quite a site to look up and see a polar bear swimming just above us. A huge, heavy thing like that able to not sink to the bottom. Amazing.</p><p>What we liked about the zoo, as Mummy says, there is no rubbish animals, and the fact they all seemed to be fairly active, no lying around, sleeping. We saw lions, elephants being feed, a group of 7 tigers playing, monkies swinging around and being pickles, giraffes, Mummy's favourite, the Tasmainian Devil, snakes, crocs, brown bear, all sorts. We had a lovely day there.</p><p>On the way home we walked into Hamley's and had another go around the toys to play with, and sneaked another McDonalds. Honestly the kiddies have been treated!</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_10-11-Denmark-Day4-ParkrunZoo.jpg</src><caption>Amagar Fallaed Parkrun</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_10-15-Denmark-Day4-ParkrunZoo.jpg</src><caption>Polar Bear Swimming</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_10-31-Denmark-Day4-ParkrunZoo.jpg</src><caption>The tiger in you</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_10-49-Denmark-Day4-ParkrunZoo.jpg</src><caption>Zoooo</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_10-51-Denmark-Day4-ParkrunZoo.jpg</src><caption>Nerf Attack</caption></image>

    <title>Denmark Holiday: Valby Park - Tivoli</title>
    <info>
		<p>We walked along the west side of the station to catch the bus. It was a dissapointing site of drug users congregating and the smell of wee. Just a contrast to the other side of Hovedbanegård where all the tourists are. However, we did spot a bakers shop which pleased us. Anyway we caught the 1A and 3A bus past Jørgen's old hairdressers shop to Valby Park, another location that Daddy hadn't visited before. There was just another unique playground with hills and towers to climb as well as animals carved from wood it seemed. After a long play we walked down to the water's edge and paddled in the water before returning through some interesting gardens back onto the bus and train, home to our hotel.</p><p>Then comes the highlight of the holiday for us children; Tivoli. First up is the 100 year old rollercoaster called Rutschebane. Everyone liked this one, and it was Daddy's old favourite. Jessica especially liked it and wanted to go on it again and again. She must have had 10 rides on it in the end.</p><p>We went on so many rides, like the Aquila, Ben's first ever upside down ride as he puts it, the Star Flyer, a glorified chair-o-plane ride, which we all found extremely scarey as the ride broke down the first time we were on it. It goes very high and there was a fair wind. Daddy doesn't mind admitting he was hanging on in there a bit. Got the heart pumping.</p><p>We won a Toblerone on the bike game, had 45 minutes of fun in the fun house. We met up with Fars later in the afternoon, they even had a go in the fun house! We got out of the park for some much needed food at Jensens Bøfhus, before returning again for a belly-testing load of rides. The one unique aspect of Tivoli is the fact it opens to late at night and the appearance of the park changes, there are a lot of pretty lights.</p><p>Katie's favourite ride was the Drop Tower, Daddy's was the boating lake, Mummy's the Demon rollercoaster ride which was spectacular at night, Ben's the upsidedown ride and Jessica the Rutschebane. We trundelled out at half ten and took the 2 minute walk back to the hotel.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_11-22-Denmark-Day5-ValbyParkTivoli.jpg</src><caption>Rock sliding</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_11-24-Denmark-Day5-ValbyParkTivoli.jpg</src><caption>Rutschebane with Jessica and Mummy</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_11-33-Denmark-Day5-ValbyParkTivoli.jpg</src><caption>On top of the Ferrish Wheel</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_11-42-Denmark-Day5-ValbyParkTivoli.jpg</src><caption>Aquila</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_11-51-Denmark-Day5-ValbyParkTivoli.jpg</src><caption>Rolling Barrel</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_11-57-Denmark-Day5-ValbyParkTivoli.jpg</src><caption>Candy Floos Girls</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_11-62-Denmark-Day5-ValbyParkTivoli.jpg</src><caption>Tivoli At Night</caption></image>

    <title>Denmark Holiday: Canal Boat - Round Tower</title>
    <info>
		<p>We had a bit of a lie in this morning but Daddy and Jessica made it out for the supermarket run ritual. Before getting over to Holmens Bridge to meet with the fars, Daddy went in the Christensborg Palace where the royal reception rooms are. Very regal.</p><p>The hour long canal tour was good. It was nice just to sit and relax for an hour and being carted around the canals and see the sights even if there was a heavy down pour near the end.</p><p>We made our way to Magasin for some pastries, watched a street performer juggle some fire lit torches and then on to the Round Tower which we raced down. Ben was captivated by the Lego store and absolutely loved it all. I think he could have stayed in there all day!</p><p>We caught the Metro and went out to Bisbjerg to see where Olemor and Olefar were scattered. We eventually found the small headstone and paid our respects. It was nice for the children to do that.</p><p>We returned back into town and ended up in the Fars accommodation where Ben opened his birthday present, which was another Lego set and we had hot dogs.</p><p>Daddy decided that when he got back to the hotel that he would go out for a late evening run which actually turned into a half marathon around the sights.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_12-09-Denmark-Day6-CanalBoat-RoundTower.jpg</src><caption>Ben and Farfar on the Canal Tour</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_12-29-Denmark-Day6-CanalBoat-RoundTower.jpg</src><caption>Pilot Benjamin Gay</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_12-34-Denmark-Day6-CanalBoat-RoundTower.jpg</src><caption>Round Tower Dash</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_12-41-Denmark-Day6-CanalBoat-RoundTower.jpg</src><caption>Lego Store</caption></image>

    <title>Denmark Holiday: Experimentum - FrederickBerg Swimming, Little Garden Meal</title>
    <info>
		<p>We hopped on the train to Hellerup and walked to Experimentum. A bit like In-Tech in Winchester, but on steroids. It was really good for the kids as they could design a dinosaur and see it come up on a big screen, chissel for fossiles, and take part in loads of interactive, science related things from water pressures, electricity, space, wind tunnel, weights and forces, reaction times and events and even attempting to lie on a bed of nails!!</p><p>Fredericksberg was the next stop for some nostalga swimming. The swimming pool Daddy always went to on holidays. It was still a strict regime which was a little awkward. Anyway we had a great time on the diving boards and slides. The fars came and joined in the fun to.</p><p>After an hour and a half in the pool we exited and headed down Marinedalesvej which is where Farmor, Olemor and Olefar used to live. The door to flat entrance was open so we stepped in and had a look. It was in very good shape which was nice to see. After having a go on the local playground we headed towards the Little Garden restaurant.</p><p>Well Daddy certainly filled his guts here. He and Farmor shared shared fish, eel, port, beef, bacon and desert. Daddy absolutely loved the meal and felt sick afterwards just on the quantity eaten! The rest of us ate a little more conservatively.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_13-06-Denmark-Day7-Experimentum-LittleGarden.jpg</src><caption>Experimentum - Fossil exploration</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_13-16-Denmark-Day7-Experimentum-LittleGarden.jpg</src><caption>Benny Bed Of Nails</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_13-19-Denmark-Day7-Experimentum-LittleGarden.jpg</src><caption>Little Garden Evening Meal</caption></image>

    <title>Denmark Holiday: Bispebjerg Park - Lise of Jørgen</title>
    <info>
		<p>Our last day. The weather was changable and therefore we decided not to go the beach, instead another playground which we saw from the train in Bispebjerg. It had a large rope climbing frame which went around like a track. Hard to explain. There was also a massive climbing wall which was brightly sprayed.</p><p>On the return journey we stopped off for a customary hot dog from the pølsevogn in the Town Hall Square. There were some Chilean football supporters there who we had some photos taken with. They were mad. We checked out of our hotel in the afternoon and made our way to Lise and Jørgen's who had also prepared some food for us.</p><p>It was nice to see Lise again after all her health issues she had been having for the past 12 months plus. They had not lost any of their friendlyness. It was really good to catch up, and the food again they prepared was amazing. Just wished us children would be a little more adventurous and actually try some.</p><p>Whoever did the planning needs shooting as we ran out of time in the airport and again almost didn't make the plane. We were last on again. Even more late this time.</p><p>The Fars sat with us children on the ride home and we landed at Gatwick on time. Back in Blighty. Bus to Horley, M25, home at 8pm.</p><p>It certainly was a bit different this holiday to our normal. It was just as enjoyable and good to see Denmark. We packed a lot in.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_14-03-Denmark-Day8-BispebjergPark-LiseJorgen.jpg</src><caption>Climbing the walls</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_14-09-Denmark-Day8-BispebjergPark-LiseJorgen.jpg</src><caption>Cuban Friends</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_14-15-Denmark-Day8-BispebjergPark-LiseJorgen.jpg</src><caption>Lise and Jørgens Summer House</caption></image>

    <title>Burnham Beeches Half Marathon - Farfar Birthday Meal</title>
    <info>
		<p>Daddy ran with James on the Burnham Beeches Half Marathon. Preparations were not ideal. Daddy went out with the boys the night before, and although he didn't drink he did stay up later than hoped. Also there was a lot of muscle ache from the football match he played last week. Still he had James to pace him around the 13.2 mile hilly, circuit.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_18-01-BurnhamBeechesHalfMarathon.jpg</src><caption>The Sub 2 Hour Taskforce</caption></image><p>When Daddy ran half marathons in 2000 in preparation for the London Marathon he didn't do well and vowed to beat 2 hours. A time which had always eluded him. All looking good 10 miles in, 30 mins to do the last 3.2 miles. However, there were up hills still to come. A fellow parkrunner, Darren, had finished his run and came back for me and James and gave loads of encouragement. Daddy really struggled up the hills near the end. It was touch and go. However, Daddy finally came in at 1:58:42. A sense of relief and a big thank you to James and Darren. Daddy has learnt control and keeping an even pace is so important.</p><p>Later in the afternoon we went around to the Fars to celebrate, sort of his birthday. We had a nice Danish meal. Ben polished off the frikadeller no probs. It was nice to see Susan and Graham. We had a trasure hunt and sweets of course as well.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_18-01-DinnerAtFars.jpg</src><caption>Farfar Dinner</caption></image>

    <title>Parkrun, Monopoly, House Pull Out</title>
    <info>
		<p>We all went for a parkrun today. Daddy beat his PB and now is 22:11. Jess managed half a lap.</p><p>Unfortunately 1 Milden Close have decided to pull out of the house sale as Mr Davey has got cancer. We are quite down by it as we would have loved that house. Still, we have to count our chickens as we are not in Mr Davey's position. Anyway we started looking at houses again. This morning we went to view a property on the Farm Road estate. Mummy really liked it, and Daddy really did not.</p><p>The weather was pretty grotty which stopped us from doing anything outside, so we started a 3 game bank holiday series of Monopoly. We also all watched James Bond, Tomorrow Never Dies.</p>

    <title>40 mile bike ride, Box Hill Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>In the morning Daddy cycled over to Phoenix Green to start a disasterous bike ride with Nick 'Jonah' King and Mr Elder. Before they even set off together Nicks valve had sheared off in his pump. Michael had punctures in both his back and front tyres!!! Boc. Anyway Daddy had a nice ride.</p><p>The weather brightened up and we all went over to Box Hill for a walk down to the stepping stones. Something achieved during the week when we went with Fiona, Thomas and Natasha.</p><p>We carried on the river route this time and we paddled in the water. Daddy swore there were things nibbling his feet, but didn't let the rest of us know. A little further on there was the coolest rope swing. All three of us had a go and it was such great fun. We eventually had to stop and crossed the river again and started a very steep climb up the hill again. It was a nice afternoon for us to go out on.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_25-11-BoxHill.jpg</src><caption>Box Hill Stepping Stones</caption></image>

    <title>Walk 45: Palaces Walk</title>
    <info>
		<p>For once we had a bit of a lie in then packed a picnic for our Palaces short walk in London. We parked up at Millbank and due to Mummy's dodgy directions we managed to do everything twice it seemed. We had lunch in Parliament Square where we watched people pose for photos. We circled parliament, the Jewel Tower and Westminster Abbey before crossing Birdcage Walk into St James's Park and a go in the swings and a close up of a pelican.</p><p>Finally we played in Green Park where we saw a fountain that we've not seen before. It was half a playground fountain. However, as we were to find out it was a dangerous one. Ben slipped over twice on it, the second time he smacked his head on the marble. Katie purposely slid from the top at a faster than expected rate and smashed her legs on the ledge at the bottom. There was a silence for 2 seconds before the screams of crying began. Bit of a dampener. Daddy walked all the way back to pick the car up and met us at the Ritz before returning home for another game of Monopoly.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_26-08-LondonPalaceWalk.jpg</src><caption>Parliament Fun</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_08_26-27-LondonPalaceWalk.jpg</src><caption>Green Park Dangerous Water Feature</caption></image>

    <info>
		<p>We accompanied Daddy down to Littlehampton where he kayaked with Jon and Gerry up the River Arun. En-route they befriended a seal who must of kept them company for about a mile or so into Arundel.

    <title>British Museum with the Wests</title>
    <info>
		<p>We went up to London with Auntie Charlotte and met up with Barrie, Freya and Harrison in a layby off the M3. The professional driver, Barrie West, who has driven to London on many occasions got lost! After 30 mins of waiting around we walked from our parking spot in Notting Hill Gate to the wonderful playground in Hyde Park. I think we could have stayed there all day. We had places to go and Mummies to see. We caught a bus, the first time the West children had been in a double decker, and made our way across the length of Oxford Street to Tottenham Court Road where we stopped off for an expensive Pizza Express!!! Anyway, we made it into the British Museum. Both Ben and Freya were doing projects on the Egyptians this year so thought it a nice idea to see the mummies. It held the children's interest for a bit and they asked lots of questions which was nice. We liked the building of the British Museum. A contemporary roof to match the old internals.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_09_29-06-LondonWithWests.jpg</src><caption>Hyde Park exodus</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_09_29-28-LondonWithWests.jpg</src><caption>Spot the Mummy</caption></image><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_09_29-39-LondonWithWests.jpg</src><caption>British Musuem was jumpin'</caption></image>

    <title>Alton Towers</title>
    <info>
		<p>Well we were supposed to do this tomorrow, but swapped our plans around as the weather forecast was even worse than today's. Despite the constant drizzle the day was not too badly effected by the weather. We left early in the morning and arrived at opening time at 10am. First roller-coaster that could be seen was the Sonic Pinball. Like a Waltzer car on a roller coaster. This was really good Katie and Ben were a little scared which was good. Jessica and Mummy went on some of the smaller rides, but Jessica is not satisfied with piddly, little roundabouts anymore. No she has to take Daddy on the Enterprise. A super fast, upside down big wheel type ride. She absolutely loved it, where as Daddy was thinking it went too fast, too much upside down and what it was doing to his stomach!!! Again, again. Mummy had the dubious pleasure next turn. Ben went on Submission, his favourite ride as it also went upside down. It was like a flying carpet ride but set at all different angles for the rider. Katie got quite scared on some of the scary, ghost train type rides. She hated Hex, which the rest of us liked. It was certainly different. You are placed in a room. You sit down and you are made to feel that you are spinning around the room. Very good.</p><p>We tried to get on the ride called Thirteen, or Th13teen. However, it was shut which was disappointing. We did Blade, the teacup ride, the driving experience, the chair-o-plane, the traditional roundabout, Ice Age 4D, which was different again. A film which had live effects like snow and bubbles raining down, wind and even things smacking the backs of your legs! Towards the end of the day we went on the water rides much to Daddy's protests! First up the log flume which we got very wet on. Next the pirate boat ride which was awesome (especially if it was hot). Each of the pirate boats had about 10 cannons which you could fire water from. People on the side of the ride could fire at them with their own cannons. Anyway Ben got soaked, but he loved it! The final water ride was the tyre ride down the rapids which again we got wet! Daddy had one final go on Rita, which was rapid and made especially better as he sat at the front! A good day had by all, finishing up with Fish and Chips and a night's stay in a Travelodge in Stafford.</p><image forweb="50"><src>images/years/2013/2013_10_12-09-AltonTowers.jpg</src><caption>Fun fun fun</caption></image>
