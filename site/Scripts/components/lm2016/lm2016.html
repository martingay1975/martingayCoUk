        <p>I am dragging my ageing carcass around 26.2 miles of London tarmac. It's the challenge for 2016. My primary aim is to not walk any of the circuit. Secondary aim is to beat 4 hours 30 mins, failing that I have to beat the pitiful effort of 2000 which was 5 hours 20 mins.</p>
        <p>I am running along with my work buddy Anthony Madden. We train about two lunchtimes a week, it sometimes gets a little competitive. He's slightly quicker than me!</p>

        <p>If you fancy coming up on the day to cheer us on, then let me know. It'll be great to see you. Laura and the kiddies will be dotted around the course. You can also track me as I run around. My running number is #14739.</p>

		<p>Anthony Nolan has a special place in my heart as my friend Emma died of the disease 16 years ago. Emma, in her early 20's had leukaemia since childhood. It was very difficult to see her deteriorate. The earlier we attempt to stop this disease the better.</p>

        <p>To get to 4 hours 30 mins I need to run at 6 mins 24s per km pace. I need to do one long run a week from the start 2016. I'll start at 10 miles and work up.</p>

        <p>I got up at 6:40am had a massive bowl of porridge, no tea for a change. Katie was nervous about coming to London because of the crowds and fear of a terrorist attack. It was only 2 minutes before leaving she bailed and fortunately the Kelley's were able to take her in. We left at 7:34am and drove around the M25, A2 to Blackheath.</p><img class="diaryImage" alt="The support crew" src="images\years\2016\2016_04_24-26-LondonMarathon.jpg">
        <p class="diaryImageCaption">The support crew</p>
        <p>I got dropped off at 9am. I met with Louise and Kelly and we started right at the back of the blue start, next to Bobafet. It took us 16 minutes to get to the start line where the support was loud. Felt really good and just wanted to jump and smash the the air to the music. For the first 5 or 6 miles I felt really good. I saw the fars, Laura, the kidies, the Elders and the in-laws. It's not till you get around the other side of the Cutty Sark do the crowds almost deafen you. I saw a 15 foot dinosaur, a man running in bare feet, Jesus and so many in fancy dress costumes. I was aiming for 6min a km for as long as I could.</p><img class="diaryImage" alt="Kelly, Loiuse and I starting at the back" src="images\years\2016\2016_04_24-35-LondonMarathon.jpg">
        <p class="diaryImageCaption">Kelly, Loiuse and I starting at the back</p><p>Moving swiftly past 8 miles and Canada Water, nature called. Fotunately there was a fence where a dozen or so blokes were lined up water the plant life. I had to join them... then off again into the quietest parts of the marathon, Bermondsey. Clicking past 11 miles and I began to feel the first effects of fatigue. However, the distraction of Tower bridge was welcommed. Again amazing support. I ran straight down the middle. You don't get the chance of running down the centre of tower bridge all that often, so made the most of it!</p>
        <p>Turning the corner and heading towards the Docklands it was nice to see the fast runners 7 miles ahead still running strong. I thought it might be de-motivational but no. I did have a look out for the likes of Phil Jelly and Ali but to no avail. That was the only point in the run I looked out for other competitors. I started to talk to an old guy who said 32 years ago he would have been 7 miles ahead of his current position. Got to give the old'uns the respect due, but I was struggling to maintain a conversation as my legs were on the turn.</p>
        <p>By mile 14 I was looking forward to seeing the family and kept a look out for them as communications were a little skant. My calfs felt so tight, I was ready to give up. However, thought I had to get to the family.... and then I became a little emotional on seeing them. I felt very privileged that Ellie and Gerry had made the effort to see me, and I re-paid them by running slowly and not really saying hello when I saw them. I cuddled Laura, Jessica and Ben, then ran off again. If I could I would have cuddled everyone. Shortly after I entered the Isle Of Dogs and the 15 mile marker. I was crushed. I began to walk and run for the next 5 miles. Each time I ran after 5 minutes the pain was insufferable and I had to walk. Others with the same idea of walking were overtaking. I couldn't even walk fast. I was so dissapointed as I felt this run was not doing myself justice after all the training. It was a problem I had not encountered before.</p><img class="diaryImage" alt="Tower bridge" src="images\years\2016\2016_04_24-54a-LondonMarathon.jpg">
        <p class="diaryImageCaption">Tower bridge</p>
		<p>Anyway 20 miles, out of the Isle Of Dogs and again by Westferry I saw the family. This really spurred me on and the tighten of the calfs disapated. Just general fatigue kicked in. The furthest I had run in 16 years now. The face slowed still dispite my spirits lifting. At 21 miles James and Duncan almost had to break the barriers and grab me before I noticed them! I went in for a Ball man-hug.</p><img class="diaryImage" alt="21 miles and the Balls" src="images\years\2016\2016_04_24-54b-LondonMarathon.jpg">
        <p class="diaryImageCaption">21 miles and the Balls</p>
        <p>24 miles and the Embankment, I tried to keep going. First time I felt the end was achieveable soon. Again I saw Laura, Ben and Jessica on Birdcage walk. It sounds stupid, but it is as if I hadn't seen them for a month, such a welcome sight. Buck house and rounding the final corner, up the home straight I remembered to finish in the middle lane where Kelvin was welcoming the runners in. The final official time was 5:06.13. I came 30255 out of 39083. 14 minutes quicker than my personal best, but 25 minutes later than what I was aiming for. I was disappointed in the time to be honest. People say I done well.... but I know better. I know I should have got a quicker time, and no one can convince me otherwise. Still the finish time only equates to 25% of the enjoyment of the very well run event.</p><img class="diaryImage" alt="The medal" src="images\years\2016\2016_04_24-57-LondonMarathon.jpg">
        <p class="diaryImageCaption">The medal</p>
        <p>Louise Parker came in a few minutes later. We both struggled to walk up the Mall. We collected a goody bag, but I was in no shape to look at it. I needed some food and drink. Thinking about it. I barely ate anything during the past 5 hours. I had a banana at 20 miles, an orange segment handed out by a crowd member, 4 energy gels and probably a pint of water in total. I would have consumed more at home on the sofa!</p>
		<p>Laura, Ben, Jess and the Fars all met me in Horse Guards Parade and nursed me back to Charing Cross where we caught a train to Lee and drove back.</p>
		<p>We got in about 6:30pm after a trip down the Fish and Chip shop!</p>

        <p>I've done this all before. See the blog account <a href="#entries/true/London Marathon/id=16-4-2000">London Marathon 2000</a>. My finishing time was 5 hours 20 mins (7:35 mins/km), which is quite embarrassing given I was at my physical peek (probably).</p>

        <p>The day itself..........</p>
        <div class="infocontent">
            <p>I was quite nervous about the day and I had to be happy with my preparation. I didn't want to think I failed because I didn't prepare how I wanted to. I had a big bowl of porridge for breakfast and trotted down the paper shop to get Lau's grandpop a paper. I wanted to make sure I was properly warmed up and felt loose. We left at about 8:15 and drove to Blackheath and got there about 8:30.</p>
            <img class="pull-right photo-size" src="/Scripts/components/lm2016/images/route.jpg">
            <p>There were lots of people, not many drove it seemed. Plenty of warming up, going to the toilet. It was one of the warmest days of the year and sunny. There was a great friendly, nervous atmosphere, with helicopters floating about. Martin and Dad rang me up just before the race to wish me good luck. Laura was there to support me. We kept shuffling forward as 9am approached. Loads of people got rid of their sweatshirts and just lobbed them to the side. I didn't even know the race had started. It wasn't until 9:15 until I crossed the start line!</p>
            <p>I took it very easy to begin with, and enjoyed it. It was great with the cheering crowds. My nervous tension meant I had to go to the toilet after the first 3 miles. The pace was effortless, but slow. At 3 miles we joined with the other starters and booed at them. It was a great atmosphere. At this point you could appreciate the enormity of the volume of people.</p>
            <p>The first milestone point was at the Cutty Sark (7 miles) where Laura waited for me. It must have taken me an hour to get there. There were so many people watching, I didn't see Lau. We had agreed to see each other a mile or so on, so from then on I was just looking at the crowd, but couldn't see her or my parents, who said they must have just missed me.</p>
            <p>Anyway come the 8/9 mile marker in Bermondsey, the marathon really began. The honeymoon period was over. The crowds were sparse and competitors a bit more concentrated. This is where the mental side began for me to tell myself to keep going. I just kept at my own pace. I reached Tower Bridge and I picked up with all the crowds. I felt a bit sad that I hadn't seen anyone and consigned myself not to seeing anyone as how would they know where I was?</p>

            <p>Half way was reached in 2:15 minutes which I was pleased at. I thought from here onwards was the most I or any of my friends had run. We saw all the runners coming back who had done 21/22 miles. I just could not comprehend running that fast. I quickly tired, and went to the toilet up a side street, I also stopped for a minute at 14 miles. I felt so disappointed in myself, but I felt light headed. I thought I was in need of sugar. 30 seconds late I began again. Luckily kids were handing out Jelly Babies and sweets. I grabbed them. My health improved again and I felt mentally very positive again, even though my body wasn't.</p>
            <p>Many people had stopped to walk at 15 miles, so it felt good overtaking a lot of people. I kept going like this for another 5/6 miles. I saw Laura by Marsh Wall (I think) which was really nice. I hope she was proud of me. I enjoyed this part as the scenery was different and I was proud of myself for keeping running, wondering where I got my stamina from.</p>
            <p>At 20 miles I was struggling again and felt hungry. I saw mum and dad for the first time. Mum looked really proud of me. I asked for food. Eventually I got a Frusli bar (oat bar) and a banana off them. They had to run after me to give it to me, which was quite funny.</p>
            <p>On exiting the Isle Of Dogs I felt I was on the last lap and all I had to do is keep going and not stop. I saw runners coming the other way, who had only done 14 miles. I felt poor sods. Although still positive in thought, my body just couldn't do much more. Nothing really hurt, just my legs couldn't do much more. I ran under Tower Bridge (22 miles), but had to start walking where the cobbled street came. I tried to start again, but really couldn't. I think I was up to about 4hrs 15mins at this point. I couldn't even walk fast! Other walkers were overtaking me! The crowds were still there.</p>

            <p>At 24/25 miles I kept coming over all emotional. Sort of crying. I don't know what that was all about. I got to parliament and the crowds were massive. I saw Susan and Graham and was able to jog again, down Birdcage Walk. This was a bit of luck as Mum and Dad were 50 yards further up with the camcorder, making it look like I'd run all the way! I turned past Bucking Palace and ran past the finish line. I felt proud and happy with myself. My official time was 5hrs 35mins, but I take the 15 minutes off to give myself 5hrs 20mins. I got my medal and someone took my chip off my shoes. I couldn't sit down, I had to make my way to the end of the Mall. Susan and Graham were by the fence. Laura was at the end, by this stage it was difficult to walk.</p>
            <p>Lau and I went over to the Foreign Press Association offices between the Mall and Pall Mall. There I had some much needed food and a 20/30 minute massage. It was nice, but I am not sure it really helped. The masseur on the next table was a fit blonde. Probably a good idea she didn't get me. Phwoaarr.</p><p>We struggled to Charing Cross via Piccadilly Circus. We eventually made it back to Lee, although Laura couldn't find the car! I then drove home and rested for the rest of the day. Went to work as normal the following day.</p>

            <p>As I was running for the Anthony Nolan trust, we managed to go up to get a sandwich in one of their building that they had hired out. We finally got back to the car and drove home. I did manage to go to work the next day!!</p>
