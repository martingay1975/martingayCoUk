We arrived before it opened so we could rush into get to the big rides before the crowds arrive.

Ben went 5 times, Jessica 2, Daddy 1 and Katie was very brave as she went in the capsule, lost her nerve, got out, then returned 2 minutes later to do the slide. The queues were relatively short for the first 90 minutes. Next up was a double rubber dinghy near vertical drop. It was terrifying for Daddy. Loved it. However, Daddy's favourite ride was the 'Superman Slide'. You go down a modest, ski jump style slide with a rolled mat in front, then launch off in a superman pose and land 5 to 10 metres from the slide. It feels as if you are flying. We did the Crazy River which had loads of whirl pools. It was good fun and even Mummy joined in on this one... despite wanting to get down as quick as possible. Ben did all the slides, even the kiddy ones. That's his thing. Mummy's favourite slide was the 5 way race straight slide, Ben's the Stuka, Jessa's and Katie's the double dinghy vertical slide.

We paid our 12 euros for the hour of fun. We had the usual Ben attempting to rock the boat over and mummy trying really hard at pedaling. We had a great time. Mummy spotted a lazy, floating chair. She hired it and read her book out on the lake. Her idea of heaven. Ben and even Daddy also had a go. It was very relaxing.

The lawns were cut fine, the trees looking mature and well kept and then the main event of two thermal spa lakes.... with some fun bits. Jessica I swear never left the lakes.

It was a path ended via a small canal with streams of Gondolas going down it. We dangled our legs in to the water (later found out this is against the laws) and ate our picnic. We bought some not so cheap sweets in the candy store. There were many shops and restaurants lining our path. Sure they were a tad more than England, but not the extortionate rates we were led to believe.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2019\\2019_08_17-20-LakeGardaItalyHoliday_4-PadovaParkrun-Venice_Venice.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Rialto Bridge' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Rialto Bridge<\/p><p>The famous St Marks square.

Jessica wasn't too happy of the amount of endless waking in the crowds and heat. Once you've seen one canal you've seen them all, was her attitude.

A few laps around terminal 2 before realizing we needed terminal 1. Fortunately Jessica saw the sign for the shuttle bus across. The weather was good, 26 degrees.<\/p>\u000a<p>We were amazed at the car Daddy got. It was almost normal and non-cheapskatey. We had a two hour journey in the Alfa Guilliet, eastwards to Cola where we picked up the keys to the apartment. The accommodation was pretty basic, off the beaten track and compact. However, it had a lovely view of the lake and had a shared swimming pool..... which we made use of straight away. We even tested our new under water camera.... and it wasn't an iPhone!<\/p>\u000a<p>We later headed out to Lidl and got in some supplies. We bought pizza, then realized we didn't even have an oven!<\/p>\u000a<p> A pasta dinner, another splash in the pool and then we decided to visit our local town, Bardolino, a mile and half away. Daddy made us do a walk. A beautiful walk that took in the quaint, narrow streets of shops and the water's edge. The sun was setting over the Alps which made for some stunning views. We continued on the edge of Lake Garda. Everyone was eating gelato. So we dipped in too. It was the nicest, best value ice cream we've ever had. We trundled through the streets, got some tat in the tourist shop before heading back to the apartment. A third and final swim with all the fairy lights on was great. 19 hour day.<\/p>\u000a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/2619274304\" target=\"_blank\">Route\u000a    \u000a    \u000a    <img class=\"image-icon\" src=\"\/Scripts\/components\/navigation\/images\/strava.png\" \/>\u000a<\/a>\u000a<img src='images\\years\\2019\\2019_08_14-11-LakeGardaItalyHoliday_1-Bardolino.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Piggy backing in Bardolino' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Piggy backing in Bardolino<\/p>\u000a<img src='images\\years\\2019\\2019_08_14-46-LakeGardaItalyHoliday_1-Bardolino.JPEG' class='diaryImage' alt='Looking onto Lake Garda and the Alps' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Looking onto Lake Garda and the Alps<\/p>\u000a<div class=\"youtube\">\u000a    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/1KuVnTGby1k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe>\u000a<\/div>\u000a\u000a<div class=\"youtube\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-Lf5_U3IRhw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/div>\u000a","images":false},"title":{"value":"Italy Holiday 1 - Flights, Bardolino"},"version":5},{"date":{"d":11,"m":8,"y":2019},"datev":20190811,"first":{"value":null},"images":2,"info":{"content":"<p>Jessica imposed a challenge on herself not to enter the house for 24 hours.

They went into the local pub in West Auckland only to find a load of other Chertsey Town supporters! The ground was neat and tidy and had some interesting undulations. Chertsey brought a 100 or so supporters. They were by far the noisiest out of the 734 in attendance. Chertsey started strong and went 2-0 up in the first half and hour. They then pretty much sat on the lead and defended resolutely to run out victors. Great celebrations afterwards, especially on the team coach back to Darlington. A full on karaoke session started up.

The boys ran out of time and had to skirt past the final half of the museum to get back home.<\/p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/2119574837\" target=\"_blank\">Route\u000a    <img class=\"image-icon\" src=\"\/Scripts\/components\/navigation\/images\/strava.png\" \/><\/a><img src='images\\years\\2019\\2019_02_02-49-CabinetWarRooms.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Benny at the treasury' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Benny at the treasury<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2019\\2019_02_02-51-CabinetWarRooms.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Nice one of Daddy and Ben' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Nice one of Daddy and Ben<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2019\\2019_02_02-53-CabinetWarRooms.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Cabinet War Rooms' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Cabinet War Rooms<\/p><p>In the evening the adults went to Danielle's, a Sicilian restaurant in Upper Hale.

They started in Tottenham. It only took them 70 minutes to get there in Sunday morning traffic. It was a proper dodgy looking area. Not one to be visited after dark. There was a cutting strong wind. Tottenham's stadium was still not finished. Almost there. After Tottenham's poverty, they headed south towards Arsenal's, Emirates stadium. In contrast the area seemed quite attractive and affluent. They circled the stadium before reaching the busy Regent's canal. They headed south east. Daddy on navigation duty missed a turning and they headed 6 miles out of there way reaching Limehouse Basin. Whoops. They headed north again past Mile End, via a hot chocolate stop. By the time they reached West Ham's stadium they were ready to push on again. Leyton Orient's ground came quickly after. A large looking non-league ground. The final leg of the journey involved going up the River Lea. The phone ran out of charge as they reached Tottenham, they circled to stadium before reaching the car and home.<\/p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/2106714456\" target=\"_blank\">Route\u000a    <img class=\"image-icon\" src=\"\/Scripts\/components\/navigation\/images\/strava.png\" \/><\/a><img src='images\\years\\2019\\2019_01_27-11-LondonFootballGroundsBikeRide2.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Football grounds postcard' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Football grounds postcard<\/p><p>Meanwhile, whilst Mummy was running Sunday club with Jessica, Katie had her science tutoring with Paul.

There was a bit of bother in the previous game. Needless to say it kicked off again on the touchline and on the pitch. Loz and their management had verbals. There was also a lot of unnecessary comments and challenges made on the pitch too. Unfortunately the referee was pulled in as a favour last minute and really was too young to referee. It ended up with Loz sending a complaint in. It mistakenly got sent to the opposition. All a bit unfortunate really. Daddy kept out of it. The game ended with a 2-0 defeat. We played some nice football. Ben was battered and gutted at the end of the game.<\/p><p>In the afternoon Mummy took Jessica to her favourite shop, Hobbycraft.

There was a good response for the call out for helpers. The boys were eager as this was an important game to win. We played Badshot Lea earlier in the season and lost. If we beat them we'd go third.

In a way a captain should.<\/li><li>Oli S making sliding tackles (not seen that commitment before). <\/li><li>A number of players heading the balls strongly. Not been scared to head.
