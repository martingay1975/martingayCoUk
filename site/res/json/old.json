I decided to do a takeoff from the ground, because if it didn't fly from a throw, then it would just smash into pieces. The moment was set. I gave her some throttle, she began to move and then..... perdunkkk! The nose dived whilst taxiing, buried itself into the ground. The propeller hit the ground as well and ripped the nose clean off. Disaster. Dad was not impressed and was in no mood for laughing! Bazza was on the other hand was wetting himself, but trying to keep it in. I saw Bazza which made me laugh and cry at the same time.
