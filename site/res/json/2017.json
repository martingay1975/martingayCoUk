Before checking out we made the use of the pool once more. Daddy wasn't going to, then felt left out so just dived in with his normal clothes on! We headed out of Los Angeles and stopped off at a diner for brekkie.<\/p><p>We retraced a lot of yesterday's route to the Hoover Dam. Parked up and walked across the Dam and back again. It was impressive. The Colorado River seemed so far down. Mummy and Daddy took the extra walk across the motorway bridge to admire the structure from afar.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_29-USA_Day10-19-HooverDam.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Hoover Dam' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Hoover Dam<\/p><p>Us children were desperate to go to Walmart to get some holiday presents, so we spent an hour or so getting lost and stacking up on sweets and all sorts of things<\/p><p>Next stop was to see the Mermaid show at the Silverton Hotel. It was stuck out on the edge of town and it did feel a bit B-league. However, the Mermaid show was good to see. A new found love for Subway from the family meant we visited one of their establishments for din dins. We took a quick look around the 'Town Square' before heading to the famous 'Welcome to Las Vegas' sign. Unfortunately we were doing the opposite and saying goodbye. The site was used as a remembrance ground for the atrocity at Mandalay Bay just a month ago.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_29-USA_Day10-56-HooverDam.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Farewell Las Vegas' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Farewell Las Vegas<\/p><p>We headed to the airport, dropped the hire car, a Toyota Camy, which we loved and wanted (but discontinued in England). We had a number of hours to kill. Daddy and Ben was drawn in by the Baseball World Series. We learnt the rules and sat, glued to the TV for 2 hours.<\/p><p>The plane home wasn't as fun as the inward journey. First we headed in a Delta Airlines plane (which was late) to New York where we changed to a very old Virgin Atlantic plane home.<\/p><p>Overall I don't think we could have fit anymore in. We certainly maximized our time out there. We didn't get a chance to watch TV or play games in the hotel rooms.

The drive down past Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam (which we didn't see) was very picturesque and the start of the Grand Canyon park. Two hours passed of monotonous, but scenic driving.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_28-USA_Day09-61-GrandCanyon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Jessica posing in front of some rocks' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Jessica posing in front of some rocks<\/p><p>A little jaded from the journey, the heat and Daddy constantly stopping for photos we arrived at the Hualapai's grounds. It felt like we had reached some kind of base camp, which it was really. There were domed temporary looking buildings next to an air strip with light aircraft buzzing in and out. We parked up and took the bus to Eagle Point: the glass walkway. We had to deposit cameras in a locker before walking on the glass floored, u shaped bridge. This annoyed Daddy intensely. He let the officials know of his displeasure, and frankly ruined the experience for him. The views were good. We were on the walkway for about 10 minutes. It was a bit of a let down to be honest.<\/p><p>We traveled by bus on to the third stop, Guano Point, which really lifted our spirits. The views from here were so much more spectacular. There was a spit of rock which you could climb to get 360 degree views. Fantastic. Katie was a little too nervous to attempt the trek and Jess was tired. The other three enjoyed some great views.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_28-USA_Day09-102-GrandCanyon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Family +1 in a Grand Canyon shot' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Family +1 in a Grand Canyon shot<\/p><p>Time was marching on very quickly, especially after faffing around for a very late lunch. We were going to make it for the Hoover Dam so we were resigned to heading back to Las Vegas. We went directly to the strip and after another spot of retail therapy in Nordstrom, we went to the Stratosphere where Ben want to try out possibly the scariest ride in the world, called Insanity. You go 900 feet in the air, get strapped to a chair which is lent forward 70 degrees, dangled off the side of the building, and then you are spun around, pulling 3G's. Mummy closed her eyes. Ben loved it. It turns Daddy stomach just thinking about it. Brave, brave, brave. The stratosphere was in a quite rough area so once finished we quickly exited the area via some tacky gift shops.<\/p><p>We went to the disappointing show in the Forum and the gardens in the Flamingo Hotel. Jessica really wanted to go on an upside ride. The New York, New York Hotel had a rollercoaster going through it which went upside down. Unfortunately she was not tall enough to go on the ride! So it was left up to Daddy and Katie to take the honours. It was quite funny to experience a rollercoaster in the middle of a city. It started off high and did end up going upside down. Again another full packed day.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_28-USA_Day09-135-GrandCanyon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='New York, New York' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>New York, New York<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"USA Day 9 - Grand Canyon"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":27,"m":10,"y":2017},"datev":20171027,"first":{"value":null},"images":3,"info":{"content":"<p>Unfortunately we had to leave Los Angeles and make the long trip to Las Vegas. We could make it simple and take the motorway route which would take about 4 hours. Instead we found a \"scenic route\" which takes us south through the Mojave Desert.<\/p><p>As we traveled along we read the guide detailing information about the towns we passed. We went past the San Bernardino mountain range with its mass of wind turbines, through 29 Palms where we tried to swim. It wasn't until we got on to the road to Amboy that we really felt were alone in the desert. The roads were straight, mountains on the horizon and a searing heat outside. At Amboy, a disused town, we saw a volcano, two massive trains and Roy's Cafe. This was the start of the old route 66. Us children weren't that impressed. We just wanted to get to Las Vegas. Daddy scooted along to Kelso and the salt flats, then the big smoke of Las Vegas. Total travel time was about 6.5 hours.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_27-USA_Day08-12-RoadTripLasVegas.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Twentynine Palms' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Twentynine Palms<\/p><p>We arrived at the vast Excalibur hotel, which was situated on the strip. It was like a fantasy hotel with a very large casino on the bottom floor. So many glorified fruit machines, the table of poker, some blackjack, craps and roulette. The hotel was so vast. Finally we got seen to and fortunately got upgraded to the Royal Tower, whatever that meant. Compared to what we had previously the adjoining rooms were luxurious. Each room had two double beds a massive shower and unfortunately a safe which Mummy put the passports and then forgot the combination code she had set! We made a quick trip to the outdoor swimming pool. What we imagined to be a typical hotel swimming pool. Curvey shape, lots of fun beds, music, a bar and a busy, shallow pool. It wasn't really us - we like a deep pool that is quiet. Still we had a nice play.<\/p><p>Graham's brother recommended a BBQ restaurant which we looked up, Rollin' Smoke BBQ. It was a bit off the strip and looked a real locals place. We were the only tourists in an otherwise 90% tourist town. The food was fantastic. The burnt ends were so tasty. We parked the car in a dodgy place and made the long walk through to the Mirage where we saw the Volcano show. We went through Caesars Palace where Katie purchased yet more makeup. $37 for some lippy! We eventually made it into posh Bellagio. After a little explore we stayed to see the fountain show.We were knackered, so Daddy and Katie went to get the car 2 miles away to chauffeur the tired crew back to the hotel.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_27-USA_Day08-50-RoadTripLasVegas.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Our Hotel, the Excalibur' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Our Hotel, the Excalibur<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_27-USA_Day08-86-RoadTripLasVegas.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Waiting at the Belagio for the fountain show' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Waiting at the Belagio for the fountain show<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"USA Day 8 - Road Trip to Vegas"},"version":3},{"date":{"d":26,"m":10,"y":2017},"datev":20171026,"first":{"value":null},"images":4,"info":{"content":"<p>Another gloriously sunny day which started for Daddy in a running lap of Disneyland <a href=\"https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/1247752323\" target=\"_blank\">Route<img class=\"image-icon\" src=\"\/Scripts\/components\/navigation\/images\/strava.png\" \/><\/a> but for everyone else a Denny's and a trip to the hotel pool. There was not much enthusiasm from us children about going on a boat for 2 hours. However, hopefully they should learn to give things a chance as this would become their highlight of the holiday. We headed to Bilboa Island at Newport Beach for a two hour whale watching tour. They say whale watching, however there appears to be a 50\/50 chance of seeing any whales. Bilboa Island was lovely and relaxed. Many of the holiday houses were dressed for Halloween. Alex our captain took just us on his speed boat out in to sea. Almost straight away we caught up with a pair of Fin Whales, the second largest animal in the world (behind the Blue Whale). They surfaced every couple of minutes. Alex mentioned how lucky we were to see them. Fin Whales were last seen a few months ago in these waters. They were distinctive with their fins which could be mistaken for a sharks. We tracked them for a long way eventually leaving them to head north for a pair of hump back whales. Alex said we had probably picked the best tour of the year. So lucky to see four whales. Although the whales should have been the highlight, the dolphins were the star of the show. Pods of 4 or 5 swum in front of the boat. Fantastico. Love them. At one point there were birds perched on the water, with the whales, dolphins and sea lions. We were very spoilt. After a couple of hours we had to return to harbour as our trip time was up. A fantastic experience.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_26-USA_Day07-81-WhaleWatching.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The whale watching crew' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The whale watching crew<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_26-USA_Day07-10-WhaleWatching.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Friendly Dolphins came to play' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Friendly Dolphins came to play<\/p><p>It was a double exciting day for the girls as it was shopping time. Katie had been researching stores to visit for the past I don't know how many months. There was a Sephora a few miles away in Huntington Beach. Whilst Katie was spending over $300 on make-up (didn't know that was possible), the boys enjoyed the crashing waves and quiet beach.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_26-USA_Day07-20-WhaleWatching.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The hunk at Hutchington Beach' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The hunk at Hutchington Beach<\/p><p>The main shopping event was still to come.

It puts a shudder down my spine.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_26-USA_Day07-28-WhaleWatching.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Girly shopping time' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Girly shopping time<\/p><p>In the evening we headed to the Packhouse for an evening meal. It was recommended by Alex, our captain, as a quirky, trendy place to eat. He wasn't wrong. Mummy had her two favouite meals on a plate: Chilli and Mac. In contrast to the excesses today we were spooked out by a homeless person who was going around the petrol station we had stopped at begging. Such ends of the scale.

It was like we had reached a different world. The atmosphere was very relaxed and felt like we were cowboys with our horses. Curtis our guide, sized us up at the stables for our one hour trip along the mountain path. Mummy got a horse which was a little lively at first. It was lovely that we were all doing the same thing. First time on horse for Jessica and Ben, and both did ever so well. First bit was a steep incline which Jessica's horse, Magic, decided to trot. It would have freaked the rest of us out, but not Jess, she gave her a little well done 'pat'. The horses were walking right on the edge of the road. One false slip and we would be down the mountain. Funnily enough we all thought what would happen if the horse was suicidal! Then Curtis mentioned how birds and snakes can startle the horses! It made for not a completely relaxing ride.

We stopped off for a much needed drink and lunch in an air conditioned trendy cafe.<\/p><p>Next we went for a drive in the car. First down Sunset Boulavard, then through to Beverley Hills which was very neat and tidy with big, expensive houses. Rodeo Drive was a narrow street with all the top shops. It almost looked fake. We just drove past admiring the expensive-ness of it all.<\/p><p>Next was a longer than expected drive through the residential parts of Bel Air. Another posh suburb. Not much traffic and wound our way up the hill to the top of Stradella Road. We were trying to spot famous peoples houses. Ben and Katie reckoned they saw some big You Tubers house.<\/p><p>It was a painfully long journey back to the hotel due to the traffic again, we went via the infamous Compton. A quick swim before going to the Italian next to the hotel and then walk over to Downtown Disney. There was a Lego, Build A Bear and Star Wars shops. A couple of street bands played which entertained the boys whilst waiting for the girls to appear from the make up shops.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_24-USA_Day05-94-Hollywood.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Our Pumpkin' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Our Pumpkin<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"USA Day 5 - Hollywood"},"version":0},{"date":{"d":23,"m":10,"y":2017},"datev":20171023,"first":{"value":null},"images":3,"info":{"content":"<p>We headed north again, but as the traffic was so bad we  went through Los Angeles.

Also we all stuck together as we could all go on everything. We experienced the rides in The Simpsons (simulator), Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey (simulator), Revenge Of The Mummy (rollercoaster), Transformers (simulator), Dispicable Me (simulator), Jurassic Park (boat flume) and of course the studio tour which took about an hour included driving into a couple of tunnels and watching fast action movies portrayed all around you. The 'Waterworld' show was very entertaining. Pyrotechnics, speed boats, acrobatics and a fantastic set. Mummy got the wetest as we all sat in the seats designated for being drenched. Overall, we had a great time here, the queues were not too long, prices not too bad. I think Harry Potter land stole the show. The street looked fantastic. Ben bought a wand from Ollivanders. We also tried Butterbeer, however the hard to describe taste didn't go down too well with us all.<\/p><p>As ever we stayed from opening time right up to closing time, so maximised our stay. Outside there was a shopping mall with various shops that took our interest. We sat and ate at Bubba Gumps.

We strolled along the promenade popping into the various t-shirt and souvenir shops. We bought some sunglasses and t-shirts. Some purchases were better received than others! Ben and Daddy watched locals play basketball which was very interesting and tried some of the apparatus around Muscle Beach. The gym at Muscle Beach was very disappointing.

We mixed it up a bit as Jessica was too short for a lot of the rides that Katie and particularly Ben wanted to go on. Ben and Katie went on: Batman, Superman, Goliath, The Riddlers Revenge and Full Throtle. The rides were very good and we stayed until after dark. It was fright night, so there were characters dressed up roaming the streets going around scaring the park One of the characters came running in and slid on his knees to scare us.

He was so worried he phoned Farfar to go to our house, take an insulin from the fridge and drive to Heathrow Terminal 3 and somehow get it through security. At this stage there was an hour and a half till take off. However, traffic was not great and time marched on. It trotted on so much that Katie who had gone through to board began sobbing, the flight info stated the gate was closing and still no insulin. Daddy had arranged with security for the insulin to be passed through as Farfar was not allowed to present in person. It finally came, 20 mins before take off. Now the dash to the plane. Of course gate 22 one of the furthest away and to add to the problems, the Heathrow staff shut off the walk way to allow passengers to exit other planes.

OK, maybe it was a bit of a stretch to say we dressed up. Daddy was the only one brave enough to put some headgear on. Black clothing was about the closest we came! Everyone else at the party looked the part. There was a massive gazebo in the back garden which was a bit of luck as it was chucking it down outside. It was to chat to Alan and Tina. I'm amazed at how Tina is so strong with all her medical issues. Strong as an ox. Good on her. She was entertaining as ever. Alan was recalling his trip to Abu Dhabi last year with James and Iolanda. Sounded amazing. Chatted to Gary and some of his friends and of course Emma. The Bullen family are very close nit, living seemingly within a mile of each other. We saw Jack's new addition to the family, Eve briefly. It was really good to catch up with everyone for Daddy. It only happens once in a blue moon.

It must have taken half an hour to get 200 metres. Still we survived and carried on eastwards. Then another field and the main road, A327, where we waited to cross the road, however, Jessica slipped into a nettle bush and screamed like you've never heard before. So much so that a lady came rushing out of her shop opposite. We looked for doc leaves and sat down. It took 5 or 10 minutes for Jessica to stop crying. The very kind ladies in Eversley Antiques Barn helped us by going home to get some antihistamine cream and some flapjacks! This helped and after half an hour of recovery we were off again.

This meant predominantly road riding now for the remaining 7 miles which pleased us all. Mummy conceded and vowed to come back another time to follow the off road route.

We escaped one royal park, into another royal area; Prince Andrew's gaff at Sunninghill - this wasn't so impressive but we had a quick peek of the 'Great Pond'.

At Swinley Forest we stopped at the Look Out where Katie and Ben saw some friends who they played with whilst we had another ice cream stop! 25km achieved so far.<\/p><p>Next we trekked Swinley Forest showing Mummy where Ben had fallen down Gravel Hill a month before and the new mountain bike area that has been chained off because it's too dangerous. Katie whilst having a 'bathroom break' in the woods left her make up bag, so Daddy had to go back to go and collect.<\/p><p>We exited out of Bracknell Forest and into Broadmoor territory which of course got Katie's anxiety juices flowing. We were ordered to hurry on. And now we came across the first of the gates, styles, obstacles to stop bikes! Daddy's duty was to negotiate 5 bikes around each of these! At first quite fun, but the novelty quickly wore off! One set of obstacles was the railway line (36km) which we crossed near Ambarrow Court.

He hurt his leg enough to be limping. He struggled to lift the bike off the road, a fellow motorist helped it up and parked it at the side of the road. Oil was leaking out, the brake level was broken and their were of course scrape marks up the bike. No other damage.
