We arrived before it opened so we could rush into get to the big rides before the crowds arrive.

Ben went 5 times, Jessica 2, Daddy 1 and Katie was very brave as she went in the capsule, lost her nerve, got out, then returned 2 minutes later to do the slide. The queues were relatively short for the first 90 minutes. Next up was a double rubber dinghy near vertical drop. It was terrifying for Daddy. Loved it. However, Daddy's favourite ride was the 'Superman Slide'. You go down a modest, ski jump style slide with a rolled mat in front, then launch off in a superman pose and land 5 to 10 metres from the slide. It feels as if you are flying. We did the Crazy River which had loads of whirl pools. It was good fun and even Mummy joined in on this one... despite wanting to get down as quick as possible. Ben did all the slides, even the kiddy ones. That's his thing. Mummy's favourite slide was the 5 way race straight slide, Ben's the Stuka, Jessa's and Katie's the double dinghy vertical slide.

We paid our 12 euros for the hour of fun. We had the usual Ben attempting to rock the boat over and mummy trying really hard at pedaling. We had a great time. Mummy spotted a lazy, floating chair. She hired it and read her book out on the lake. Her idea of heaven. Ben and even Daddy also had a go. It was very relaxing.

The lawns were cut fine, the trees looking mature and well kept and then the main event of two thermal spa lakes.... with some fun bits. Jessica I swear never left the lakes.

It was a path ended via a small canal with streams of Gondolas going down it. We dangled our legs in to the water (later found out this is against the laws) and ate our picnic. We bought some not so cheap sweets in the candy store. There were many shops and restaurants lining our path. Sure they were a tad more than England, but not the extortionate rates we were led to believe.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2019\\2019_08_17-20-LakeGardaItalyHoliday_4-PadovaParkrun-Venice_Venice.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Rialto Bridge' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Rialto Bridge<\/p><p>The famous St Marks square.

Jessica wasn't too happy of the amount of endless waking in the crowds and heat. Once you've seen one canal you've seen them all, was her attitude.

A few laps around terminal 2 before realizing we needed terminal 1. Fortunately Jessica saw the sign for the shuttle bus across. The weather was good, 26 degrees.<\/p>\u000a<p>We were amazed at the car Daddy got. It was almost normal and non-cheapskatey. We had a two hour journey in the Alfa Guilliet, eastwards to Cola where we picked up the keys to the apartment. The accommodation was pretty basic, off the beaten track and compact. However, it had a lovely view of the lake and had a shared swimming pool..... which we made use of straight away. We even tested our new under water camera.... and it wasn't an iPhone!<\/p>\u000a<p>We later headed out to Lidl and got in some supplies. We bought pizza, then realized we didn't even have an oven!<\/p>\u000a<p> A pasta dinner, another splash in the pool and then we decided to visit our local town, Bardolino, a mile and half away. Daddy made us do a walk. A beautiful walk that took in the quaint, narrow streets of shops and the water's edge. The sun was setting over the Alps which made for some stunning views. We continued on the edge of Lake Garda. Everyone was eating gelato. So we dipped in too. It was the nicest, best value ice cream we've ever had. We trundled through the streets, got some tat in the tourist shop before heading back to the apartment. A third and final swim with all the fairy lights on was great. 19 hour day.<\/p>\u000a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/2619274304\" target=\"_blank\">Route\u000a    \u000a    \u000a    <img class=\"image-icon\" src=\"\/Scripts\/components\/navigation\/images\/strava.png\" \/>\u000a<\/a>\u000a<img src='images\\years\\2019\\2019_08_14-11-LakeGardaItalyHoliday_1-Bardolino.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Piggy backing in Bardolino' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Piggy backing in Bardolino<\/p>\u000a<img src='images\\years\\2019\\2019_08_14-46-LakeGardaItalyHoliday_1-Bardolino.JPEG' class='diaryImage' alt='Looking onto Lake Garda and the Alps' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Looking onto Lake Garda and the Alps<\/p>\u000a<div class=\"youtube\">\u000a    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/1KuVnTGby1k\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe>\u000a<\/div>\u000a\u000a<div class=\"youtube\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/-Lf5_U3IRhw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/div>\u000a","images":false},"title":{"value":"Italy Holiday 1 - Flights, Bardolino"},"version":5},{"date":{"d":11,"m":8,"y":2019},"datev":20190811,"first":{"value":null},"images":2,"info":{"content":"<p>Jessica imposed a challenge on herself not to enter the house for 24 hours.

They went into the local pub in West Auckland only to find a load of other Chertsey Town supporters! The ground was neat and tidy and had some interesting undulations. Chertsey brought a 100 or so supporters. They were by far the noisiest out of the 734 in attendance. Chertsey started strong and went 2-0 up in the first half and hour. They then pretty much sat on the lead and defended resolutely to run out victors. Great celebrations afterwards, especially on the team coach back to Darlington. A full on karaoke session started up.

Tottenham's stadium was still not finished. Almost there. After Tottenham's poverty, they headed south towards Arsenal's, Emirates stadium. In contrast the area seemed quite attractive and affluent. They circled the stadium before reaching the busy Regent's canal. They headed south east. Daddy on navigation duty missed a turning and they headed 6 miles out of there way reaching Limehouse Basin. Whoops. They headed north again past Mile End, via a hot chocolate stop. By the time they reached West Ham's stadium they were ready to push on again. Leyton Orient's ground came quickly after. A large looking non-league ground. The final leg of the journey involved going up the River Lea.

Ben was battling in the centre of midfield. Both had battle wounds at the end of the game. In the second half Alton regained the lead with some dodgy keeping from Cam. Ben popped up later from a corner, used his physical presence (i.e. fouled 2 players) whic allowed him to scramble in an equalizer. Late in the game, Tyler was through 1 on 1 with the keeper and Joey miss-timed his tackle and wiped the Falcons forward out. Joey was booked.

Daddy skidded, the backend of the bike going sideways for a bit. A change of underpants later and he somehow managed to avoid the car!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_11_11-47-TeneriffeCycling_3-SantaCruzTF12.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Some lovely scenery climbing TF12 ' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Some lovely scenery climbing TF12 <\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_11_11-38-TeneriffeCycling_3-SantaCruzTF12.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Hills!' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Hills!<\/p><p>Finally they found a great cafe stop called Casa Santiago and ate Tappas. Almost at the top now and again they split up, leaving Daddy trailing behind..... and bang! Puncture going down the hill. Not only that the same 'valve' problem as before at London Ride 100. The pump kept unscrewing the valve. This was exhausting work. Finally Daddy managed to get going again. Everyone else was waiting a while. Another two miles on. Bang! Not again! A second puncture. He almost threw the bike in the bushes. He cut through some slippery rocks having gone off road attempting to reach the others. Michael took a look and noticed that the brakes block had been scraping against the tyre sidewall and created holes! A boot was made, a second change of innertube and the boys were off and running again.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_11_11-61-TeneriffeCycling_3-SantaCruzTF12.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Second puncture repair' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Second puncture repair<\/p><p>It was all downhill from here and they all stuck together going through the city centre and final stretch of flat where Daddy could confidently put some power down and wasn't last!

After a bit of a mishap at the start with directions, we crossed north of the TF1 and ascended up Tiede which was the focal point of the whole island.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_11_10-41-TeneriffeCycling_2-TiedeAllTheWay.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='At the beginning in Los Christianos ' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>At the beginning in Los Christianos <\/p><p>Daddy really struggled compared to the others.

Crashed. Car almost hits me, tourist gets flat car battery\" rating=\"8\"><p>Reaching the cable cars by the volcano took a lot longer than expected. Five and half hours predominantly in first gear (28 cassette). The final 3 miles had quite an ascent. Daddy was still going up hill after the cable cars. Dusk was forming. The views were amazing. Some sand dunes, strange rock formations and a dried lava river. Fantastic. The light was drawing in quick and as the sun descended and the shadows grew, the temperature dropped as Daddy started his descent down the north side. Cars had there lights on, Daddy unfortunately had no front light and the back had run out of battery. However, not a problem in the semi light, Daddy descended at a steady pace. Within the next mile or two, close to Portillo Alto, the skies were clear and the moon could be seen clearly. Still enough to descend. Now the rocky landscape changed to pine trees lining the roads. This meant what little light there was had now gone. Daddy was freezing, especially on the hands. He was shivering so much it slowed him down as his bike wobbled down the hill. With no light Daddy chose to use the maps on his phone to know when a bend was coming up. Fortunately most of the traffic had gone, but there was still the odd car coming down the mountain. Whenever car lights were seen from behind, Daddy thought it best to stop and go into the side of the road. Daddy had managed to descend about 1000 metres like this. <\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_11_10-14-TeneriffeCycling_2-TiedeAllTheWay.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='It's getting darker.

However, he couldn't see the side of the road and misjudged it. He rode into the gutter \\ ditch. He fell off into the gutter, his bike ended on the road, on the bend. Fortunately the car behind swerved around it, the car following also managed to somehow miss it! Daddy picked himself up, brushed himself down. He sustained a bruised elbow and a small cut to the knee. The bike however had a buckled wheel and was un-rideable.<\/p><p>As there was no place to stop, the two cars went 50 yards down the road and then stopped. Both drivers spoke to each other in English. Daddy could hear that they were saying I was stupid for riding down a mountain with no lights.The second was accusing the first of hitting Daddy! Daddy assured them it was his fault and apologised profusely. They both offered to take Daddy down the mountain in the car. Daddy had already international rescue, aka Michael to pick him up. The first driver who was a German tourist offered to take Daddy back to the villa with the bike. A little taken aback from his generosity, Daddy politely refused and urged him to continue on his travels. Michael was an hour away. The German tourist insisted in staying until Michael arrived. He left his car lights on so Michael could see where we were. After conversations about WWII, Brexit and the car industry, he noticed that the car lights dimmed. He tried starting his car, but all that was heard was tick, tick, tick! Oh no. His battery was now flat.<\/p><p>The obvious solution was to push start the car, but both were unsure. What happens if that was not the problem and the car was pushed down the mountain in the pitch black, little on the brakes (servos no power) and no place to rest up if it didn't work. With Daddy's luck he envisaged pushing the German off the mountain to his death!<\/p><p>Michael arrived and with some convincing the car was bump started and all was good. The adventure was over. Goodbyes were said.

Here we had booked in to go on an adventure trip around Penmachono Slate mines which ran for 200 years. We kitted up in wellies and a hard hat and caught a mini bus, southwards. The site was close to Ffestiniog. The slate was also quarried at this site. We could see the rejected slate. We climbed up on the slate, then through the most beautiful wood ever. It was thick with trees, ladened with moss on the trunk. It was almost eerie as we climbed a kilometer or so to one of the modest entrances to the mine. Last wee stop for a few hours!<\/p><p>We entered the mine. Glad we had wellies on as the ground was a mix of puddles and a running stream. We continued to climb and got to a chamber filled with water. The only way to the next stage was to get in the rubber dinghy and paddle across. The guide told us all we needed to know about the slate mine. We had a number of other elements to tackle during our 3 hour stint under ground including: zip wire, abseil and plenty of rock climbs. Interestingly enough we were told to be careful when we stopped for lunch as any crumbs created would turn into lumps of penicillin. There is nothing else to take the debris out of the cave! We finally climbed up a 80 foot ladder back to the surface near to the top of the mine.

Daddy put his motorbike on Autotrader at Â£750, listing all the problems with it. The most severe was an oil leak. On Thursday he got a phone call from a Russian chap (Russian 1) wanting to come down from Leicester to see it. He arrived after football training in the dark. He could barely speak English. So bad, Daddy had to send the house postcode by text. The Russian brought his friend along (spoke equally as badly) who almost drove it through next door's front window. They were obviously concerned about the oil leak, but they really didn't have a clue about motorbikes. They liked the bike and offered Â£700 which Daddy accepted. They paid a Â£300 deposit and said he'll be back on Sunday morning (today) to collect it.<\/p><p>Friday came along and a short email message came through from a chap called Dimitri asking if I knew where the oil leak was. Daddy replied no, and the chap asked to see the bike that evening. Daddy thought it was Russian 1, given the name 'Dimitri' just wanting a closer look at that oil leak. Dimitri emailed to say he's had a job cancelled in Watford and he come down. Bearing in mind this was Friday night rush hour, he must have spent an hour and a half getting from Watford. He arrived and Daddy soon realized Dimitri was not the same person as Russian 1. Massive dilemma. Does he tell this new chap that there is a mistake in identity. Daddy couldn't do this so explicitly seeing he had traveled so far. Daddy's tactic was to exaggerate the oil leak and all the other faults. He did such a bad job that Dimitri offered the full amount and could pay for it all right now! Arrrgghhh. Daddy couldn't say no - what excuse could he have given? So the paper work was done, the only proviso was that he couldn't take the bike away till Monday, during the daytime. So Daddy gave him the keys to the motorbike so he could just ride off.<\/p><p>Daddy then frantically tried to get hold of Russian 1 to say the deal was off. Citing a problem in Daddy's new bike, therefore needing his old bike. Over a dozen calls and texts were sent during the Saturday and Sunday and no reply.<\/p><p>Daddy was very nervous. What if Russian 1 just turned up, having not read any of the messages, seeing the motorbike in driveway and wondering why he couldn't drive it away. Fortunately, he didn't turn up. Not a peep. Perhaps he'd forgotten.<\/p><p>In the end Russian 1 contacted Daddy a few days later, and was ok about the situation. It then took another week for the deposit money to be returned as there was an issue with receiving SMS texts from him. Daddy feels he got away with that one.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_09_17-14-SellingMotorbike.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The silver bullet has got to go' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The silver bullet has got to go<\/p><\/woops><p>Katie has been struggling with science at school, which is partially at the fault of the school and their bad teachers.

Getting out of the airport was a mission in itself. Or at least getting out at the right exit. Eventually he was out and running up a dark, spooky path with 6 foot high chain link fences either side. At Horley some people who had finished in the pub for the night were wondering why I was jogging at 1am in the morning!

The reason we chose Tenerife was because we looked up where the best Water Park in the world was. Siam Park was the answer, so based our whole holiday around this. Mummy had saved Â£600 to get us all the VIP tickets. This granted us unlimited fast pass entries and unlimited food and drink. The Teale's were also in Tenerife and we met up here to experience the day together.<\/p><p>The big question was going to be whether Ben could get on the Tower of Power. The large, drop slide. The big problem was you had to be 14. When Alice also said you had to be 45kg, Ben was upset and had resigned himself to not going on the slide. There was a bit of phaffing at the start, but by 10:30 we were off and starting our first slide. Mummy was relishing the free food and drink. Having the fast pass was certainly useful. The normal queues were long and would have taken 30 \/ 40 minutes plus. Fast passes were about 10 minute queues.<\/p><p>Most rides involved an inflatable ring. Many of them needed 2, 3, or 4 people to ride in them. It was great. Having got around to the afternoon having tried all but 2 rides. Probably the best two rides. First up the Tower of Power.<\/p><p>No fast pass on this, but the queue was reasonably short. Daddy was confident that Ben would not pass for 14. He was shocked at the exchange. Attendant: How old are you? Ben: 14 Attendant: Really? Ben: Yes. Attendant: OK then, on you go! Unbelieveable. Ben very happy. Daddy dreading what was coming up. 20 minutes later Ben at the top and the lady gently shoving him down the slide. Daddy followed. Ben's reaction: it wasn't that scary! The second ride was one with a shared inflatable with 4. It went so high up the banked edges. Daddy and Ben went on with some weighty people. We stayed to the end. Daddy and Ben calculated 18 slide goes and a trip on the lazy river and big wave machine.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_08_21-05-Tenerife_7-SiamPark-Teales.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Jessica and Alice' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Jessica and Alice<\/p><p>We were invited back to the Teale's villa just 10 minutes away.

Definitely the steepest roads Daddy has ever driven. After an hour and a half of driving we eventually we reached the town of Garachico.<\/p><p>Garachico used to be the biggest port in the Canaries until a volcano erupted and destroyed the town. The lava formed these natural rock pools which is used to today by us and other tourists to swim in. Dare devil Ben was finding the highest rocks and jumping in first. The rest of us timidly followed in after him. It was an interesting setup. We played around for an hour or so before heading in to the sleepy town. We walked the picturesque streets via the church and town square. We made it to an ice cream shop to have some much needed cool down time.<\/p><p>We returned to another part of the natural pools.

The Europcar lady replied when asked Daddy said there were only 4 people. Daddy called her a liar, because he hadn't said that. The voices were raised and anger displayed from both parties. At the 'liar' accusation the lady threatened to call the police. Daddy welcomed, this and invited her to do so. Daddy wasn't going away! The lady turned to her next customer, who was listening to this and served them for the next 10 minutes. Daddy waited patiently. After dealing with the customer, Daddy asked where the police were, so the matter could be dealt with...... she hadn't called them. Daddy said she had therefore lied again! Eventually she allowed the use of her phone (which was not available) so Daddy could speak to customer services.

After, they walked around Parliament Square looking at all the statues and onto Westminster Abbey.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_08_06-11-LondonBen.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Lunching by parliament' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Lunching by parliament<\/p><p>2pm and they made it to Portcullis House, got security screened and met up with James. He's a church friend who works for Gary Streeter MP. He happens to be the chairman of the Christians In Politics group, which James helps on. James's degree in Politics and Theology means this is the perfect job it would seem. However, after 5 years he leaving to train as a vicar.<\/p><p>James first led us through a tunnel, under Westminster Bridge Road, which we didn't realise existed. He began by taking us to Westminster Hall, the only original part of Parliament after the fire in 1834. Through St. Stephens Hall and into the Central Lobby. We first turned right towards the Lords end of Parliament. Everything is red and gold. It was very interesting to hear the stories and protocol. We headed towards the Commons next. At first I thought this was big, then thought how small it was to house 650 MPs. It was interesting to the galleries which you don't see on the TV. Again some interesting points of fact. After an hour and a half we ended back up at Westminster Hall and thanked James very much for his time.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_08_06-18-LondonBen.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Westminster Hall' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Westminster Hall<\/p><p>We caught a bus and briefly got off at Trafalgar Square. Ben was very pleased to see London again. Because of Katie's anxiety over London we generally don't go up much these days. Ben loves it. They continued on the bus past Piccadilly Circus and up Regents Street. They disembarked went in the Bose shop and visited all 5 floors of Hamleys. Harry Potter and Lego are still the big sellers. They walked through Carnaby Street, visiting some sports shops before hitting Nike Town at Oxford Circus. The initial purchase was made for a school bag. We then went into many other sports shops. Ben loved it as there were all the shops he could hope for, and they were all the flagship outlets, which meant they were big. Time was marching on and they were both fatigued from their excursion. A tube ride took them back to Waterloo. They were then able to train it back home.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_08_06-12-LondonBen-COLLAGE.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Various London bits' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Various London bits<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Parliament Tour, Imperial War Museum, Oxford Street retailing"},"version":2},{"date":{"d":5,"m":8,"y":2018},"datev":20180805,"first":{"value":null},"images":3,"info":{"content":"<p>Ben turned into a teenager today.

Not sure whether to laugh or cry. Myself and Michael had entered the Prudential Ride 100. A 100 mile bike ride, starting and ending in London. As a back-drop to this, I had not done any distance training, and I had the Thursday and Friday off work due to feeling rundown, sore throat and a headache. So going into this I was concerned about my overall physical state.<\/p><p>We had to register on the Saturday at Excel. The traffic around to the opposite end of the M25 meant it was touch and go whether we'd make the 5pm deadline. The journey involved going in Michael's mobile gas chamber. There is a fault, such that exhaust fumes go into the car, so we had to roll the windows down. With just a few minutes to spare, we dumped the car in a pub car park close by, hoping we wouldn't get clamped. We got in just in time. Even managed to get some cheeky photos in.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_07_29-03-PrudentialRide100.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='At the show' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>At the show<\/p><p> We made our way to the hotel, 'rebuilt' our bikes and watched the Tour De France highlights. After, I went out to the supermarket to get some supplies from Tesco. Got on the bike went around a bend and almost fell off. Rear puncture! Great one of my two inner-tubes used up before I'd even started! Eventually rode the 1.5 mile trip past Excel to a Tesco Express. There were a lot of people shopping and milling about outside. I was a little nervous at leaving the bike right outside, so wheeled it down a barrier'ed slipway to a car park. I went in got yogurt, milk and some fruit. I was panicking a bit, so quickly went out to check. The bike was still there. I went back in again to pay for the shopping. Must have been 2 or 3 minutes. GONE. Bike was nicked.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_07_29-29-PrudentialRide100.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Where has my bike gone. Site of crime!' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Where has my bike gone. Site of crime!<\/p><p>I knew there was no chance finding it. It would have been long gone. I did look around, but nothing. I wasn't so worried about the bike so much, but it had my timing chip on it and the bracket \/ clips for my lights which are going to be hard to replace. Also, what was I going to tell Michael? I started the long trudge back to the hotel and was resigned to the face I wasn't going to do the ride. It was now 9:30pm, I entered the hotel and told Michael what had happened. After he stopped laughing, he hatched a plan which would involve driving 1h 45 minutes back to Alton to pick up his spare bike and drive all the way back again. So windows down in the car for a 3.5 hour round trip plus a bit extra as the bike had no pedals and needed a tweak here and there.<\/p><p>On returning back, I managed somehow to lose the hotel entry card. So we needed to call the receptionist, issue us a new card. We just needed our beds. As soon as we got in our room, I went to the toilet and pressed what I thought was the cord for the light switch. As it was a disabled toilet, it wasn't a cord for the light switch, instead it was the emergency cord! Oh dear. A mini-siren sounded, a flashing red light out the room and the receptionist running towards us. Again this is 2:30 in the morning! After apologising and setting the phone alarm for 2 hours 10 minutes time we finally went to sleep.<\/p><p>4:40am and the alarm went off. What were we doing? Gulped some breakfast down, managed to lose the second of our room cards, and took our stuff out to the car. Michael hid his car key on the tyre of the car, misjudged it and the keys clattered inside the wheel. We just left it for now as we were running behind schedule. The weather was a little nippy as we rode the 6 miles to the start line. The scale of the operation was vast. 29,000 riders all starting from the same area. Myself and Michael, not only had different start times, but also were starting at opposite ends of the Queen Elizabeth Park. So I decided to try and sneak in and start with the 'Greens' at the earlier time.<\/p><p>It was 7:05am and we were finally off. It was nice to get going finally. Within 15 minutes the heavens opened and for the next 8 hours it rained and rained. We hooked on to some fast trains as we snaked our way through London and finally out into the countryside. My 'new' bike was great. Loved it. The seat post needed adjusting, but otherwise the ride was much better than my Giant Defy.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_07_29-12-PrudentialRide100.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='To the Tower' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>To the Tower<\/p><p>Michael picked up a puncture around the Byfleet area. The stop and the rain made us a little cold so we stopped in for a coffee. We got to Newlands Corner and stopped for a bit, before heading down the fast descent down towards Gomshall. As I raced down, Pssstttt. A wobbly front wheel made me almost lost control as I had a blow out. Damm it, another puncture.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_07_29-14-PrudentialRide100.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Puncture going down Newlands Corner' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Puncture going down Newlands Corner<\/p><p>My turn. We must have spent over 30 minutes trying to sort this out. We had a problem. We changed the tube, pumped it up and as we unscrewed the pump, the valve unscrewed with, making the air come all out. We must have tried 2 or 3 times. It really is exhausting stuff trying to get enough pressure into the tubes. Michael ingenious idea was to tighten the valve to the inner-tube by trapping it in the rear axel with the use of the quick release. This worked a treat and finally we pumped the tyre again, and off we went. Better still there was a track pump just up the road to get me up to the ideal pressure. Also a chap sold his spare inner tube as we had none between us and we hadn't much luck so far. Then down the next hill again and Pssssttttt. Arrrrgghhhh. Another puncture in the same wheel. Something fishy going on now. The tyre sidewall had eroded a bit. We worked out that the brake block was set too low and was rubbing against the tyre, causing the punctures. We happened to fix the puncture at the bottom of the road leading to Netley House, my company's old premises. Again quite a time was spent re-enforcing the tyre with a gel and getting the tyre pumped up. It was still hammering down with rain. Again we were down to no spare inner-tubes between us and now I couldn't use the front brake. We were just entering the really hilly section now!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_07_29-15-PrudentialRide100.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='At this point, chucking the bike in the hedge was looking appealing' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>At this point, chucking the bike in the hedge was looking appealing<\/p><p>We were diverted past Leith Hill as someone had a heart attack and CPR was being administered by the paramedics. That explained the various ambulances and medical vehicles screaming passed us. I found a track pump, but rather than making things better it made them worse as all the air escaped. It was a rubbish pump. I managed to get back to 40 psi, but it was less than half inflated. It was slow going through Dorking due to the traffic. The organisers had shut Box Hill due to an accident. So we avoided both main hills and it meant we were only going to do 90 miles, not 100. At the next stop there was a bike shop. Yippee.. I managed to get full pressure again in my tyre, but they had sold out of inner tubes. With 25 miles to go we hit another blockage in the road at Leatherhead.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_07_29-17-PrudentialRide100.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Held up in Leatherhead' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Held up in Leatherhead<\/p><p>The rest of the journey back to London was quite pleasurable. The weather started to clear and as I hadn't actually felt we had started, I had plenty of energy to push some pace. We finished at goodness knows in what time. It was largely irrelevant.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_07_29-22-PrudentialRide100.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Finishing down The Mall' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Finishing down The Mall<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_07_29-27-PrudentialRide100.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The Medal shot' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The Medal shot<\/p><p>We collected our medals, took some photo's and headed back to City Airport. However, we were determined to do 100 miles. Considering we had done 6 extra miles to get to the start line, we decided to ride back to Tower Hill and catch the DLR. I made it back home at 8pm. What a journey the past 28 hours were. Because my timing chip was stolen it hadn't counted officially, so that means I got to do it again another year.

Today all five of us went to the Eating Disorder clinic in Epsom where we had a 3 hour meeting talking about Katie's condition. They were assessing whether they would take us on for a 6 week course of treatment which largely involves giving advice and helping Katie get back to a healthy weight. The meeting involved the Nurse, a psychiatrist and a student nurse. In fact Mummy knew the psychiatrist from a talk she gave a few weeks previous on the very subject matter. The nurse also lived in Mytchett and had a son who goes to Tomlinscote and is in the same year!<\/p><p>It was very hard to hear Katie's account. It boils down to body image. The trigger point happened in February. A number of contributing factors include: Being called fat by one of her friends, body image pressure, looking up to friends who have a thin figure, seeing on the internet that you shouldn't eat after 7pm, sometimes bored after school, thinking we were too poor to buy food and probably lots of other things. Daddy cried in the meeting - when Katie was out of the room, it distressed him greatly. Mummy was obviously very concerned and anxious as well. Jessica and Ben contributed as well in the meeting and had a role to play.<\/p><p>We were told that BMI was not used as a measure in children. Instead they use some other height vs weight measurement. It was expressed that 100% is a normal, healthy weight. They recommend children should be between 95% and 105%. At 80% they recommend that the child should be taken out of school. Katie was just above that at 81%. Very concerning. The solution was simply to load calories. Avoid anything that takes away the calories such as exercise. 3000 calories was suggested. 3 meals a day, 3 snacks a day and a pint of 3% fat milk (blue top).<\/p><p>The clinical team went away to meet and they agreed to take Katie on. Initially for a 6 week stint to get her weight back. After that, depending on how she is doing, some psychiatric treatment will be given.<\/p><p>It was quite a session, but at the end of it, we had acceptance from Katie and we felt we had a plan going forward.<\/p><p>After, we went into Kingston and went to Pizza Hut to eat the unlimited buffet.

She was running late, so entered the church service and sat in one of the pews. For Sunday School she needed a microphone so the children could be interviewed. The nearest we had was Ben's megaphone which was accidentally left on. This unknown to anyone played havoc with the church's sound system and basically provided feedback. The feedback was so loud, the congregation were blocking their ears. Unknown to anyone the megaphone was the cause of this problem. Some stand in engineers were up on ladders, fiddling around with cables attempting to fix the problem. They even switched off the sound system and yet the feedback was still reverberating around the church. It was then decided that the service could not continue inside, so it was decided that the service should be held outside.<\/p><p>As Mummy went to leave the church to go outside with the others, she picked up the bag and all of a sudden the noise stopped for a bit, and the pitch of the squeal changed. At that point she knew the cause of the problem. The Megaphone!<\/p><p>Instead of owning up or even just removing the bag, mummy panicked and just left the bag inside the church and joined the service outside.<\/p><p>After 10 minutes Mummy had to leave the service to do Sunday school and made Auntie Charlotte go and get the bag which was in church. However, the men who were busy attempting to find the source of the problem were still there. Mummy told Charlotte to grab the bag and quickly escape. Instead, once the bag was moved it became very obvious to everyone the source of the problem! As no one knew her, she just owned up and said it was her sister's and then sheepishly sloped off. After Sunday school we all ran home without talking to anyone.<\/p><p>The parishioners  later were gossiping about the silly girl who brought a megaphone into church.

The lack of food intake has been minimal and what is being consumed has all been healthy stuff. She has been having fruit for breakfast, skipping lunch at school (because she hasn't time) and then not eating much for dinner. No snacks either. Today and last night it all came to a head, and Mummy took her down to the GPs where she was diagnosed with Anorexia. She is 43kg and her height is 163.5cm. The GP has referred her on, and in 2 weeks we have a follow up appointment for bloods. Katie does not like speaking about it and has been in denial about it. Today, however, she recognises there is an issue and is positive about resolving it. She loves 'planning' at the moment. So we popped to Hobbycraft and purchased a large piece of card. Katie has looked up meals and snacks that she would like and has written them on cards. So for each day of the following week she knows what she is going to have at breakfast, lunch and dinner. She also has a snack card. She seems quite determined to follow the plan. She says she feels a lot happier and that she has turned over a new leaf. This week at shopping she went around the supermarket and got all the ingredients for the menu's she has devised.

We even got to get tickled by a shrimp! The Lego cars were eagerly awaited and didn't disappoint. Katie was an expert at pulling off a u'ie without notice, Ben an expert at looking cool and easy and Jessica loved a good car wash and petrol station visit. There was the River Tyre ride which Daddy got soaked on (see video) and possibly the most exhilarating rides were at the end of the day.

The day was bright and flight smooth, if a little noisy as it appeared to be doubling up as the âLegoland Special.â We touched down on time at around 10.30 (Danish time) then spent an eternity queuing to go through passport control. There were only two positions available which was obviously inadequate.<\/p><p>That hurdle passed, our next task was to collect our vehicles.

We set off into the sunshine to the nearby town Grinsted and arrived to a near deserted town centre soon after noon to seek a cafe for lunch. A walk through the main street, popping into what shops were open (most close at one oâclock on a Saturday in Denmark), brought us to a highly suitable eatery where we sat outside in the sunshine for a varied lunch.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2018\\2018_05_26-02-Denmark_Day1-LegoHouse.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Katie and the church in Grinsted' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Katie and the church in Grinsted<\/p><p>Thus sated, our next task was to stock up with provisions which we managed at the Kvickly supermarket (in contrast, they stay open all hours) in the town of Brande, five miles from our destination. Beer, of course, was an important item in the inventory, along with sufficient food to get us through the weekend. Arrival at our destination was effected by about two thirty which gave us an hour to settle in before our first event.<\/p><p>The accommodation was at the Damgard B and B on Fasterholt Vej, set back 200 yards or so, just outside Ejustrupholm. It was an annex of a former farm and set in many acres of land that could be explored. Downstairs, it consisted of a utility room, kitchen, living room, one bedroom and a bathroom, all of generous size and well appointed. Upstairs lay a large landing, a room in itself, a bathroom, two ânormalâ bedrooms and a large family bedroom. There was heaps of room all round.<\/p><p>Our first adventure, the Lego House, beckoned for we had tickets for a 4.00pm entry. Billund, direct, took a smidgen over half hour.

Two hours passed of monotonous, but scenic driving.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_28-USA_Day09-61-GrandCanyon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Jessica posing in front of some rocks' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Jessica posing in front of some rocks<\/p><p>A little jaded from the journey, the heat and Daddy constantly stopping for photos we arrived at the Hualapai's grounds. It felt like we had reached some kind of base camp, which it was really. There were domed temporary looking buildings next to an air strip with light aircraft buzzing in and out. We parked up and took the bus to Eagle Point: the glass walkway. We had to deposit cameras in a locker before walking on the glass floored, u shaped bridge. This annoyed Daddy intensely. He let the officials know of his displeasure, and frankly ruined the experience for him. The views were good. We were on the walkway for about 10 minutes. It was a bit of a let down to be honest.<\/p><p>We traveled by bus on to the third stop, Guano Point, which really lifted our spirits. The views from here were so much more spectacular. There was a spit of rock which you could climb to get 360 degree views. Fantastic. Katie was a little too nervous to attempt the trek and Jess was tired. The other three enjoyed some great views.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_28-USA_Day09-102-GrandCanyon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Family +1 in a Grand Canyon shot' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Family +1 in a Grand Canyon shot<\/p><p>Time was marching on very quickly, especially after faffing around for a very late lunch. We were going to make it for the Hoover Dam so we were resigned to heading back to Las Vegas. We went directly to the strip and after another spot of retail therapy in Nordstrom, we went to the Stratosphere where Ben want to try out possibly the scariest ride in the world, called Insanity. You go 900 feet in the air, get strapped to a chair which is lent forward 70 degrees, dangled off the side of the building, and then you are spun around, pulling 3G's. Mummy closed her eyes. Ben loved it. It turns Daddy stomach just thinking about it. Brave, brave, brave. The stratosphere was in a quite rough area so once finished we quickly exited the area via some tacky gift shops.<\/p><p>We went to the disappointing show in the Forum and the gardens in the Flamingo Hotel. Jessica really wanted to go on an upside ride. The New York, New York Hotel had a rollercoaster going through it which went upside down. Unfortunately she was not tall enough to go on the ride! So it was left up to Daddy and Katie to take the honours. It was quite funny to experience a rollercoaster in the middle of a city. It started off high and did end up going upside down. Again another full packed day.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_28-USA_Day09-135-GrandCanyon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='New York, New York' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>New York, New York<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"USA Day 9 - Grand Canyon"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":27,"m":10,"y":2017},"datev":20171027,"first":{"value":null},"images":3,"info":{"content":"<p>Unfortunately we had to leave Los Angeles and make the long trip to Las Vegas. We could make it simple and take the motorway route which would take about 4 hours. Instead we found a \"scenic route\" which takes us south through the Mojave Desert.<\/p><p>As we traveled along we read the guide detailing information about the towns we passed. We went past the San Bernardino mountain range with its mass of wind turbines, through 29 Palms where we tried to swim. It wasn't until we got on to the road to Amboy that we really felt were alone in the desert. The roads were straight, mountains on the horizon and a searing heat outside. At Amboy, a disused town, we saw a volcano, two massive trains and Roy's Cafe. This was the start of the old route 66. Us children weren't that impressed. We just wanted to get to Las Vegas. Daddy scooted along to Kelso and the salt flats, then the big smoke of Las Vegas. Total travel time was about 6.5 hours.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_27-USA_Day08-12-RoadTripLasVegas.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Twentynine Palms' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Twentynine Palms<\/p><p>We arrived at the vast Excalibur hotel, which was situated on the strip. It was like a fantasy hotel with a very large casino on the bottom floor. So many glorified fruit machines, the table of poker, some blackjack, craps and roulette. The hotel was so vast. Finally we got seen to and fortunately got upgraded to the Royal Tower, whatever that meant. Compared to what we had previously the adjoining rooms were luxurious. Each room had two double beds a massive shower and unfortunately a safe which Mummy put the passports and then forgot the combination code she had set! We made a quick trip to the outdoor swimming pool. What we imagined to be a typical hotel swimming pool. Curvey shape, lots of fun beds, music, a bar and a busy, shallow pool. It wasn't really us - we like a deep pool that is quiet. Still we had a nice play.<\/p><p>Graham's brother recommended a BBQ restaurant which we looked up, Rollin' Smoke BBQ. It was a bit off the strip and looked a real locals place. We were the only tourists in an otherwise 90% tourist town. The food was fantastic. The burnt ends were so tasty. We parked the car in a dodgy place and made the long walk through to the Mirage where we saw the Volcano show. We went through Caesars Palace where Katie purchased yet more makeup. $37 for some lippy! We eventually made it into posh Bellagio. After a little explore we stayed to see the fountain show.We were knackered, so Daddy and Katie went to get the car 2 miles away to chauffeur the tired crew back to the hotel.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_27-USA_Day08-50-RoadTripLasVegas.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Our Hotel, the Excalibur' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Our Hotel, the Excalibur<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_27-USA_Day08-86-RoadTripLasVegas.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Waiting at the Belagio for the fountain show' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Waiting at the Belagio for the fountain show<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"USA Day 8 - Road Trip to Vegas"},"version":3},{"date":{"d":26,"m":10,"y":2017},"datev":20171026,"first":{"value":null},"images":4,"info":{"content":"<p>Another gloriously sunny day which started for Daddy in a running lap of Disneyland <a href=\"https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/1247752323\" target=\"_blank\">Route<img class=\"image-icon\" src=\"\/Scripts\/components\/navigation\/images\/strava.png\" \/><\/a> but for everyone else a Denny's and a trip to the hotel pool. There was not much enthusiasm from us children about going on a boat for 2 hours. However, hopefully they should learn to give things a chance as this would become their highlight of the holiday. We headed to Bilboa Island at Newport Beach for a two hour whale watching tour. They say whale watching, however there appears to be a 50\/50 chance of seeing any whales. Bilboa Island was lovely and relaxed. Many of the holiday houses were dressed for Halloween. Alex our captain took just us on his speed boat out in to sea. Almost straight away we caught up with a pair of Fin Whales, the second largest animal in the world (behind the Blue Whale). They surfaced every couple of minutes. Alex mentioned how lucky we were to see them. Fin Whales were last seen a few months ago in these waters. They were distinctive with their fins which could be mistaken for a sharks. We tracked them for a long way eventually leaving them to head north for a pair of hump back whales. Alex said we had probably picked the best tour of the year. So lucky to see four whales. Although the whales should have been the highlight, the dolphins were the star of the show. Pods of 4 or 5 swum in front of the boat. Fantastico. Love them. At one point there were birds perched on the water, with the whales, dolphins and sea lions. We were very spoilt. After a couple of hours we had to return to harbour as our trip time was up. A fantastic experience.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_26-USA_Day07-81-WhaleWatching.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The whale watching crew' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The whale watching crew<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_26-USA_Day07-10-WhaleWatching.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Friendly Dolphins came to play' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Friendly Dolphins came to play<\/p><p>It was a double exciting day for the girls as it was shopping time. Katie had been researching stores to visit for the past I don't know how many months. There was a Sephora a few miles away in Huntington Beach. Whilst Katie was spending over $300 on make-up (didn't know that was possible), the boys enjoyed the crashing waves and quiet beach.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_26-USA_Day07-20-WhaleWatching.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The hunk at Hutchington Beach' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The hunk at Hutchington Beach<\/p><p>The main shopping event was still to come.

It puts a shudder down my spine.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_26-USA_Day07-28-WhaleWatching.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Girly shopping time' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Girly shopping time<\/p><p>In the evening we headed to the Packhouse for an evening meal. It was recommended by Alex, our captain, as a quirky, trendy place to eat. He wasn't wrong. Mummy had her two favouite meals on a plate: Chilli and Mac. In contrast to the excesses today we were spooked out by a homeless person who was going around the petrol station we had stopped at begging. Such ends of the scale.

It was like we had reached a different world. The atmosphere was very relaxed and felt like we were cowboys with our horses. Curtis our guide, sized us up at the stables for our one hour trip along the mountain path. Mummy got a horse which was a little lively at first. It was lovely that we were all doing the same thing. First time on horse for Jessica and Ben, and both did ever so well. First bit was a steep incline which Jessica's horse, Magic, decided to trot. It would have freaked the rest of us out, but not Jess, she gave her a little well done 'pat'. The horses were walking right on the edge of the road. One false slip and we would be down the mountain. Funnily enough we all thought what would happen if the horse was suicidal! Then Curtis mentioned how birds and snakes can startle the horses! It made for not a completely relaxing ride. However, it was a lovely experience and one of Daddy's best of the holiday.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_24-USA_Day05-05a-Hollywood.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='A bunch of cowboys and girls' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>A bunch of cowboys and girls<\/p><p>We headed into Hollywood itself and went for a walk up and down Hollywood Boulavard to see the Chinese Theatre and all the stars on the pavement. We stopped off for a much needed drink and lunch in an air conditioned trendy cafe.<\/p><p>Next we went for a drive in the car. First down Sunset Boulavard, then through to Beverley Hills which was very neat and tidy with big, expensive houses. Rodeo Drive was a narrow street with all the top shops. It almost looked fake. We just drove past admiring the expensive-ness of it all.<\/p><p>Next was a longer than expected drive through the residential parts of Bel Air. Another posh suburb. Not much traffic and wound our way up the hill to the top of Stradella Road. We were trying to spot famous peoples houses. Ben and Katie reckoned they saw some big You Tubers house.<\/p><p>It was a painfully long journey back to the hotel due to the traffic again, we went via the infamous Compton. A quick swim before going to the Italian next to the hotel and then walk over to Downtown Disney. There was a Lego, Build A Bear and Star Wars shops. A couple of street bands played which entertained the boys whilst waiting for the girls to appear from the make up shops.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_10_24-USA_Day05-94-Hollywood.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Our Pumpkin' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Our Pumpkin<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"USA Day 5 - Hollywood"},"version":0},{"date":{"d":23,"m":10,"y":2017},"datev":20171023,"first":{"value":null},"images":3,"info":{"content":"<p>We headed north again, but as the traffic was so bad we  went through Los Angeles.

Eventually we made it to Universal Studios, parked up and headed in on this very hot day.<\/p><p>There were loads of simulator based rides, which sound not as good as the coasters, however, they were done really well. Also we all stuck together as we could all go on everything. We experienced the rides in The Simpsons (simulator), Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey (simulator), Revenge Of The Mummy (rollercoaster), Transformers (simulator), Dispicable Me (simulator), Jurassic Park (boat flume) and of course the studio tour which took about an hour included driving into a couple of tunnels and watching fast action movies portrayed all around you. The 'Waterworld' show was very entertaining. Pyrotechnics, speed boats, acrobatics and a fantastic set. Mummy got the wetest as we all sat in the seats designated for being drenched. Overall, we had a great time here, the queues were not too long, prices not too bad. I think Harry Potter land stole the show. The street looked fantastic. Ben bought a wand from Ollivanders. We also tried Butterbeer, however the hard to describe taste didn't go down too well with us all.<\/p><p>As ever we stayed from opening time right up to closing time, so maximised our stay. Outside there was a shopping mall with various shops that took our interest. We sat and ate at Bubba Gumps.

We strolled along the promenade popping into the various t-shirt and souvenir shops. We bought some sunglasses and t-shirts. Some purchases were better received than others! Ben and Daddy watched locals play basketball which was very interesting and tried some of the apparatus around Muscle Beach. The gym at Muscle Beach was very disappointing. It looked weathered and empty. It had seen better days.

There were over a dozen rollercoasters. Some where you lie flat, lie on your back, stand up, go 100 mph, highest loop. The queues into the park were long, the queues in the park were also long. We mixed it up a bit as Jessica was too short for a lot of the rides that Katie and particularly Ben wanted to go on. Ben and Katie went on: Batman, Superman, Goliath, The Riddlers Revenge and Full Throtle. The rides were very good and we stayed until after dark. It was fright night, so there were characters dressed up roaming the streets going around scaring the park One of the characters came running in and slid on his knees to scare us.

He was so worried he phoned Farfar to go to our house, take an insulin from the fridge and drive to Heathrow Terminal 3 and somehow get it through security. At this stage there was an hour and a half till take off. However, traffic was not great and time marched on. It trotted on so much that Katie who had gone through to board began sobbing, the flight info stated the gate was closing and still no insulin. Daddy had arranged with security for the insulin to be passed through as Farfar was not allowed to present in person. It finally came, 20 mins before take off. Now the dash to the plane. Of course gate 22 one of the furthest away and to add to the problems, the Heathrow staff shut off the walk way to allow passengers to exit other planes. It was very frustrating as Daddy was in a rush.

It was held at her house in Weymouth. We arrived 3 hours into the party. As Emma was a hardened punk in the 80s, we all dressed in punk outfits. OK, maybe it was a bit of a stretch to say we dressed up. Daddy was the only one brave enough to put some headgear on. Black clothing was about the closest we came! Everyone else at the party looked the part. There was a massive gazebo in the back garden which was a bit of luck as it was chucking it down outside. It was to chat to Alan and Tina. I'm amazed at how Tina is so strong with all her medical issues. Strong as an ox. Good on her. She was entertaining as ever. Alan was recalling his trip to Abu Dhabi last year with James and Iolanda. Sounded amazing. Chatted to Gary and some of his friends and of course Emma. The Bullen family are very close nit, living seemingly within a mile of each other. We saw Jack's new addition to the family, Eve briefly. It was really good to catch up with everyone for Daddy. It only happens once in a blue moon.

It must have taken half an hour to get 200 metres. Still we survived and carried on eastwards. Then another field and the main road, A327, where we waited to cross the road, however, Jessica slipped into a nettle bush and screamed like you've never heard before. So much so that a lady came rushing out of her shop opposite. We looked for doc leaves and sat down. It took 5 or 10 minutes for Jessica to stop crying. The very kind ladies in Eversley Antiques Barn helped us by going home to get some antihistamine cream and some flapjacks! This helped and after half an hour of recovery we were off again.

Due to the slow progress it was decided at Preston Oak Hills that we should go the quickest route to the hotel. This meant predominantly road riding now for the remaining 7 miles which pleased us all. Mummy conceded and vowed to come back another time to follow the off road route. Quick progress was made until we got to the final 2 miles where there was a long uphill section and an off-road bit!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_05_31-26-Windsor2WinchesterBike_Day2-Eversley.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Cutting through the bush' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Cutting through the bush<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2017\\2017_05_31-34-Windsor2WinchesterBike_Day2-Eversley.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Come on Mummy only 2 miles to go' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Come on Mummy only 2 miles to go<\/p><p>We finally made 'The Woolpack Inn' at 7:30pm.

We stopped off and looked down 'The Long Walk' back towards the castle. We escaped one royal park, into another royal area; Prince Andrew's gaff at Sunninghill - this wasn't so impressive but we had a quick peek of the 'Great Pond'. Crossing the road, we hit the start of the old mile course at Ascot. Interesting to see the old concrete pillars which helped stop enemy aircraft using it as an airstrip during the war.

We stopped off at Englemere Pond for some refreshments before crossing Whitmore Bog, Swinley Park and then onto Swinley Forest. We won't mention  the stop or non-stop at the Woodcutters pub! At Swinley Forest we stopped at the Look Out where Katie and Ben saw some friends who they played with whilst we had another ice cream stop! 25km achieved so far.<\/p><p>Next we trekked Swinley Forest showing Mummy where Ben had fallen down Gravel Hill a month before and the new mountain bike area that has been chained off because it's too dangerous. Katie whilst having a 'bathroom break' in the woods left her make up bag, so Daddy had to go back to go and collect.<\/p><p>We exited out of Bracknell Forest and into Broadmoor territory which of course got Katie's anxiety juices flowing. We were ordered to hurry on. And now we came across the first of the gates, styles, obstacles to stop bikes! Daddy's duty was to negotiate 5 bikes around each of these! At first quite fun, but the novelty quickly wore off! One set of obstacles was the railway line (36km) which we crossed near Ambarrow Court. Unfortunately Daddy dropped his phone and it cracked the screen! Arghhh.<\/p><p>By the time we got to Tri-Lakes we were ready to stop and wished our hotel would come to us, rather than vice versa. Mummy led us into someone's big property in Moulsham Green. The Indian man came out and was most helpful. Mummy was almost arguing with him, saying the book instructs us to go this way. The man helped us, and Mummy mis-read and agreed with the man in the end.... and felt a bit embarrassed about making a small fuss!<\/p><p>Finally we made it to the main road in Eversley and tried 2 pubs who had very similar menus and similar prices before settling on the third pub, The Golden Pot. We collapsed and sat down for a lovely big meal. Partly to celebrate Mummy's passing of her nursing exam.<\/p><p>Just up the road was our hotel, the Kingsley. It looked lovely and there were 5 beds for us.

So he was a little sceptical on how useful the course would be.<\/p><p>Retrospectively speaking, the course surpassed expectations and he was really glad he went on it. So much so, Daddy really could have done with this course much earlier. What it taught him over the 3 days, was it's not sugar so much, but carbohydrates as a whole. So the porridge Daddy eats each morning requires more insulin to be taken than a doughnut for instance. During the week they calculated that for every 8 grams of carbs taken, 1 unit of Humalog is required. Also a correction dosage of 1 unit for every 2mmol. Also probably the 20 units of Lanctus was a few too many. It's now reduced to 18. The other thing learnt was carb counting. So estimating the carb content in a plate of food. This estimating process is now a lot better. Finally at the end of the course a new gluscose monitoring machine was handed out. Daddy now enters the number of carbs taken, and the machine calculates the insulin dosage. Since the course (and even during the course), Daddy's control has got a lot better.

It was quite atmospheric with the steam wafting about and the organ music playing in the background. We had a go on Neptune first, then an old fashioned roundabout thing which crushed poor Jessica. A real stomach churner. We had candy floss, went on the steam train, swing boats, chair-o-planes and carousel. Ben was really tired come the end of the day. We had a great time, something a bit different and left at about 10pm.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_22-15-HollycombeSteam.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Fars enjoying Hollycombe' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Fars enjoying Hollycombe<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_22-11-HollycombeSteam.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Jessica in vintage car' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Jessica in vintage car<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"parkrun, Ben Football, Elders, Hollycombe Steam Fair"},"version":3},{"date":{"d":16,"m":10,"y":2016},"datev":20161016,"first":{"value":null},"images":3,"info":{"content":"<p>In the morning we went off to church and Daddy for once didn't go out on a ride or run!

Dave stopped at the villa to sort some work stuff out. The others drove to the top of Puig Major, the highest point in Majorca. On the way they stopped off at Sa Ruta Verde for yet more 'large' coffee and juices. Some clothing was also bought. They parked just before the tunnel at the top of the 8000 foot mountain. Down below was the destination, the town of Soller. It was a spec in the distance. It was pretty misty and cold so it was jackets on for the fast descent.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_10-403-Majorca_Day4-PuigMajor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Before the 7200 foot Puig Major Descent' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Before the 7200 foot Puig Major Descent<\/p><div class=\"youtube\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/9vJlTfnFGIE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/div><p>Down they went. Bob and Robin raced off, Michael hung back with Daddy and Nick attempting to get some Go Pro footage. It was a 8.5 mile trip down completed in 18 minutes. It was flat out most of the way, going full pelt before applying the brakes slightly for the sweeping bends. There were quite a few nutters road skiing back up the mountain. That was pretty hardcore. Daddy managed to hit a large stone on the way done, giving him a speed wobble. Undeterred they all raced down for the best 8.5 miles ever.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_10-405-Majorca_Day4-PuigMajor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The Rockets in Soller' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The Rockets in Soller<\/p><p>At Soller, Michael and Robin decided to ride back up Puig Major to the bus. They managed to clock in just under the hour which is very impressive. The others meanwhile continued through and climbed Coll de Soller. A hard climb, where Daddy yet again almost came off his bike when he was distracted rounding a tight hairpin. It was tough going. The descent on the other side was not much to write home about. The road surface was poor and length of straights short. There was a beautiful stretch of tarmac however leading into the town of Bunyola. Bob stopped off for his prized map which he had been after for the whole trip. They also got chatting to this English girl who overtook them on the Coll de Soller. She was cycling on her own, I guess no one could keep up with her. The initial climb out of Bunyola was nice, with terraced houses clinging on to the rock face. The next challenge was to attempt to get to Orient before Michael and Robin caught the three remaining boys up. In the way was the Col de Honor. A tricky little devil but had little traffic. The last hill climb of the holiday, so Daddy put all his effort into it. Another sweat on, another attempt on trying to keep Bob in Daddy's sights. 30 minutes later and the bus passed just before the summit. The road surface was pretty poor on the way down, but Daddy and Bob made it to Orient. Far beyond what they thought they could achieve today. Time was getting tight so it was villa bound in the bus. <\/p><p>A rather hectic clean up, lunch and departure from the villa which will be missed. It served the boys well. Will always remember Miguel for his 'uffff' comment. Not sure what it means, it is assumed it is like a huff or a sigh!<\/p><p>The flight home was fully booked so Dave had to stop for an extra night so he was dropped off at his hotel in the centre of Palma. With an hour or so to kill the boys took in another coffee and went souvenir shopping on the front and dipped on the beach just so they could say they touched the sea!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_10-410-Majorca_Day4-PuigMajor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='On the beach in Palma' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>On the beach in Palma<\/p><p>The bus drop off and flight went accorrding to schedule.

However, after a large breakfast, the boys were almost ready to go. Daddy had another overnight puncture. This broke the breach and they looked into why he had 3 punctures within a day. Too many for a coincidence and the boys found that a previous spoke repair had been carried out without taping the wheel properly again! Thank goodness resourceful Bob had some tape with him.... and off they went - initially with a slight drizzle of rain.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-301-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='On our way together' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>On our way together<\/p><p>A few miles down the road, rain jackets off and a stop off at a nice little coffee \/ juice bar where Michael and Robin had man-sized coffees. This bar, Sa Ruta Verde, was much loved. Perhaps because it had nice drinks, merchandise and a owner who was very sociable. A challenge was set for the foxes to catch the hares up the mountain to the petrol station. Bob sneaked in first (hare), followed by Nick (hare) and Daddy (hare) then shortly after Michael (fox), Robin (fox) and Dave (hare). They stopped for 'petrol' and veered off yesterday's route down past Lluc on a short downhill stretch.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-310-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Robin and Michael enjoying big drinks for a big ride' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Robin and Michael enjoying big drinks for a big ride<\/p><p>The group split and came back together a few times as they skirted around Puig Tomir and then down some more big hills. The cars were a bit of an obstacle.... well not to Michael, he sped past most of them. Then once on the flat into and past PollenÃ§a the Rockets looked like a pro outfit. The six were drafting and making superb progress. Probably Daddy's favourite bit just because they were altogether working as a team and speeding along at a great rate. Fantastico.<\/p><p>An early lunch in Port de PollenÃ§a. Michael happened to drop his guts in the town centre which a couple of tourists heard. Daddy and Nick made the most of it and egged on the tourists to laugh at him and make smelly hand waving actions. All were holding their noses. I think Michael was a touch embarrassed, and so he should. :)<\/p><p>After many miles of easy riding, the boys were still on the way out and now the tricky Formentor peninsula had to be tackled - 12 miles of it. First a 800 foot climb to Mirador Es Colomer where there were many tourist marveling at the north coast view and an obelisk. The boys moved on attempting to tick off a mental barrier, the half way point. Many ups and downs, a tunnel and a lady wanting her picture taken by Michael were all on the route.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-331-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The tunnel on the way to Formentor' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The tunnel on the way to Formentor<\/p><p>Finally, they rounded the final bend and the lighthouse was waiting and drawing the Rockets in. There were cars queueing for quite a way. Daddy smugly overtook them and reached the rest of the group. Time for looking about. Couldn't get too close to the lighthouse. The views were pretty good. Robin was bushed and I've seen worse places to kip!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-339-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Robin making the most of the views!' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Robin making the most of the views!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-345-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Rockets at Formentor 1' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Rockets at Formentor 1<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-346-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Rockets at Formentor 2' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Rockets at Formentor 2<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-348-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The actual lighthouse' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The actual lighthouse<\/p><p>They had a few group shots, before moving off on the homeward journey. Again good initial pace was made and the journey off the peninsula seemed much quicker than the one to the lighthouse. They hugged the coast down Port de PollenÃ§a again turning right and much relief away from the traffic and other cyclists. In fact it was nice to be alone again. Daddy and Nick followed the route back whilst the others took a slightly longer route - they got lost! Daddy by now with only 10 miles to go was flagging seriously and had to stop a number of occasions. Nick was great support. Finally everyone met at the local bar, Bar Sa Tafona in Biniamar for a well earned beer.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-354-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Well deserved beer in Biniamar' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Well deserved beer in Biniamar<\/p><p>The last evening and the decision was made to go out to eat. Biniamar had nothing to offer, so whilst we were getting ready Mr King was tasked on finding a place to eat. They crammed in the bus and headed for the next town of Llosseta. Nick on navigation took them down some very narrow streets and credit to E'ster who drove superbly. The passengers just shut their eyes and prayed. They dumped the van in the town square (a bit unorthodox) and set on foot. Nick not inspiring confidence on knowing where he was going. We almost completed a lap, but stumbled across the targeted, Celler Can Carrossa Restaurante. Not many in, and looked a little too fine for the rabble of men. However, we set forward and went for the set menu. Course after course came out. I think Nick must have sweated a bit as the diners were getting increasingly concerned at the final bill. Siz courses of fine dining later, the bill came out at just 35 euros each. A bargain considering the quality. They had puffer fish, lamb, sorbet, and many other dishes. Nick got a pat on the back in the end. An end to great day. Packed a lot in.<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Majorca Biking Day 3 - Formentor"},"version":18},{"date":{"d":8,"m":10,"y":2016},"datev":20161008,"first":{"value":null},"images":10,"info":{"content":"<ul><li>Distance: 79 km<\/li><li>Climbs: 3,108 metres<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/741279810\" target=\"_blank\">Day 2 Route\u000a               \u000a        \u000a            <img class=\"image-icon\" src=\"\/Scripts\/components\/navigation\/images\/strava.png\" \/><\/a><\/li><\/ul><p>The first big day and the iconic Sa Calobra with it's twisting, switch back roads.

Robin and Michael shot off as they were so much quicker than the remaining four. That was pretty much the last time they were seen! The rocky limestone mountains created a complex and striking landscape, dotted with fig and olive trees that cling to the mountain side. Itâs no wonder the mountain range has been awarded UNESCO World Heritage status. The four reached the peak and the petrol station landmark at the top. A hub for all cyclist, road and off road. Don't think any cars actually filled up with petrol. Some of the views on the ascent were breath taking. Also the first experience of the switch backs.

Bob and Dave raced down, whilst Daddy and Nick stopped here and there for a few photos. Wow what a decent - speeds close to 40mph. Near the bottom of the mountain Daddy got a puncture, luckily it wasn't when he was going fast - the first ever on a road bike. As they were fixing it, Michael and Robin went past on the way back up Sa Calobra.

It was an early flight, meaning Daddy left home at 2:00am to meet first with Bob. However, first issue. As Daddy had to carry quite a bit on his motorbike he clipped his cycle helmet to the bag, meaning it was flapping around at 80mph down the A331. Then fling..... the helmet was no longer attached. Daddy hadn't realized this until reaching Bob's house. So a speedy exit back onto the A331, followed by a crawl in the dark to find the missing helmet, hoping no other vehicle had damaged it. Fortunately, it was lying at the side of the road in North Camp without damage! Not a great start.<\/p><p>Dave met up and drove to Gatwick where all the crew met together. Only Daddy got stopped at security (for no reason!) and then off and away on the 5:40am flight to Palma.<\/p><p>Having arrived in warmer climes, they picked up the hire car and shot off to the villa (Cami Vell) in Biniamar, via the supermarket and bank in Inca. Daddy was having trouble getting enough cash out of the ATM to pay for the villa. Fortunately they got around the problem, and after an hour's worth of showing the villa off, Miguel left the tried, but still eager cyclists to their own devices. Unfortunately when the bikes turned up Dave's was the wrong size. Michael also wanted to spend a bit of time adjusting his bike, so only Daddy, Robin, Nick and Bob went cycling and headed 20 miles eastwards towards Port d'AlcÃºdia. Nick and Bob almost had a coming together when a car turned in on then.... they attempted to see the sea, but realized they were looking at Es Llac Gran, a lake!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_07-105-Majorca_Day1-PortDePollenca.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Es Llac Gran' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Es Llac Gran<\/p><p>They crossed the road, saw some ladies play beach volleyball and moved on quickly, deciding to head north and meet up with the other two in Port de PollenÃ§a! Cycling was like a dream. Perfect weather conditions, the roads on the whole were smooth and a pleasure to ride on. One stretch however along the bay, Badia de PollenÃ§a, had a narrow, bumpy, two way cycle path, which would be very dangerous if not fully concentrating. Pedestrians and runners also shared this highway. A couple of incidents!<\/p><p>The four reached Port de PollenÃ§a and found Tolos Bar and supped on a couple of pints of strong lager.... the strength of which is still not resolved today!

They were pitched just at the right level of difficulty. Ben had the classic impatient, give it me attitude and fell into the trap of, if not finding the answer straight away then give up.... then when he read half the clue, would rush off! This would cost us dearly later on!<\/p><p>After over 2 hours we eventually made it to the half way stop at the Mytchett Canal Centre where we stopped for refreshments with the Fars. Ice Creams and drinks all round. Part 2 of the treasure hunt saw us explore into the woods behind the cafÃ©. This proved more challenging and more popular for some reason. We eventually ended up at bottom of Deepcut, passing some horses along the way. Here we trusted Ben a bit too much. 'After Lakeland House' take the next right, go along the road for a bit and look for a sign naming the woods'. Well Ben thought he saw the house at the corner with the mini roundabout so we turned up Bellew Road. We looked left, no evidence of the sign. We went up the big hill, some had to walk. Still nothing. We basically went the length of Bellew Road into Deepcut. We doubled back again and went to the junction with Lake Road. Daddy Re-read the clue and questioned the Lakeland House part of the clue and wanted to see for himself this house. It was not where Ben had said it was. In fact we shouldn't have gone down Bellew Road at all. Lakeland House was further towards Frimley Green. We should have turned down St Catherines Road. To atone for his earlier mistake Ben went rushing off to look for the sign. Yep you guessed it. He rushed right past it and ended up near to the Fars house. Daddy found the sign a kilometre back! We must have lost half an hour due to Ben's antics. We all had a laugh about it! We ended the 28 clues back at our house and dealt out the final treasure which proved fruitful for us children.\u000a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/724872944\" target=\"_blank\">Treasure Hunt Route<img class=\"image-icon\" src=\"\/Scripts\/components\/navigation\/images\/strava.png\" \/><\/a><\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"6 Football Grounds Bike Tour, Farfar's Bike Treasure Hunt"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":24,"m":9,"y":2016},"datev":20160924,"first":{"value":null},"info":{"content":"<p>Mummy and Daddy went to get their flu jab first thing.

It's 9 a-side on a 1\/2 pitch, 30 minutes each way, rolling subs. We had 11 players, including one girl, Lucy. Ben has and was very excited to be playing, although gutted to miss parkrun. He was larking about with his mates for most of the warm-up. Daddy was on the strictest of instructions not to 'give advice' and just let Ben get on with it! Ben started centre midfield and surprised Daddy on how well he did. He got involved. He looked to get the ball, rather than wait to come to him, he 'skilled' people, he passed, he shielded all very good. At this age strength is a bit of a problem in terms of kicking the ball hard and getting shrugged off the ball. Mytchett were outclassed really. There was the rare attack from us. On one occasion, Ben bullied his way throw and the goalkeeper took him out. Penalty! Ben steps up and........ keeper saves it. Bad luck Ben. Ben got 'studded' at the end of the first half which made him cry. He got up though and got on with it. Eventually we were on the end of a 7-0 defeat but the team enjoyed themselves, which is the most important thing. Ben got man of the match.

Katie was nervous about coming to London because of the crowds and fear of a terrorist attack. It was only 2 minutes before leaving she bailed and fortunately the Kelley's were able to take her in. We left at 7:34am and drove around the M25, A2 to Blackheath.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_04_24-26-LondonMarathon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The support crew' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The support crew<\/p><p>I got dropped off at 9am. I met with Louise and Kelly and we started right at the back of the blue start, next to Bobafet. It took us 16 minutes to get to the start line where the support was loud. Felt really good and just wanted to jump and smash the the air to the music. For the first 5 or 6 miles I felt really good. I saw the fars, Laura, the kidies, the Elders and the in-laws. It's not till you get around the other side of the Cutty Sark do the crowds almost deafen you. I saw a 15 foot dinosaur, a man running in bare feet, Jesus and so many in fancy dress costumes. I was aiming for 6min a km for as long as I could.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_04_24-35-LondonMarathon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Kelly, Loiuse and I starting at the back' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Kelly, Loiuse and I starting at the back<\/p><p>Moving swiftly past 8 miles and Canada Water, nature called. Fotunately there was a fence where a dozen or so blokes were lined up water the plant life. I had to join them... then off again into the quietest parts of the marathon, Bermondsey. Clicking past 11 miles and I began to feel the first effects of fatigue. However, the distraction of Tower bridge was welcommed. Again amazing support. I ran straight down the middle. You don't get the chance of running down the centre of tower bridge all that often, so made the most of it!<\/p><p>Turning the corner and heading towards the Docklands it was nice to see the fast runners 7 miles ahead still running strong. I thought it might be de-motivational but no. I did have a look out for the likes of Phil Jelly and Ali but to no avail. That was the only point in the run I looked out for other competitors. I started to talk to an old guy who said 32 years ago he would have been 7 miles ahead of his current position. Got to give the old'uns the respect due, but I was struggling to maintain a conversation as my legs were on the turn.<\/p><p>By mile 14 I was looking forward to seeing the family and kept a look out for them as communications were a little skant. My calfs felt so tight, I was ready to give up. However, thought I had to get to the family.... and then I became a little emotional on seeing them. I felt very privileged that Ellie and Gerry had made the effort to see me, and I re-paid them by running slowly and not really saying hello when I saw them. I cuddled Laura, Jessica and Ben, then ran off again. If I could I would have cuddled everyone. Shortly after I entered the Isle Of Dogs and the 15 mile marker. I was crushed. I began to walk and run for the next 5 miles. Each time I ran after 5 minutes the pain was insufferable and I had to walk. Others with the same idea of walking were overtaking. I couldn't even walk fast. I was so dissapointed as I felt this run was not doing myself justice after all the training. It was a problem I had not encountered before.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_04_24-54a-LondonMarathon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Tower bridge' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Tower bridge<\/p><p>Anyway 20 miles, out of the Isle Of Dogs and again by Westferry I saw the family. This really spurred me on and the tighten of the calfs disapated. Just general fatigue kicked in. The furthest I had run in 16 years now. The face slowed still dispite my spirits lifting. At 21 miles James and Duncan almost had to break the barriers and grab me before I noticed them! I went in for a Ball man-hug.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_04_24-54b-LondonMarathon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='21 miles and the Balls' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>21 miles and the Balls<\/p><p>24 miles and the Embankment, I tried to keep going. First time I felt the end was achieveable soon. Again I saw Laura, Ben and Jessica on Birdcage walk. It sounds stupid, but it is as if I hadn't seen them for a month, such a welcome sight. Buck house and rounding the final corner, up the home straight I remembered to finish in the middle lane where Kelvin was welcoming the runners in. The final official time was 5:06.13. I came 30255 out of 39083. 14 minutes quicker than my personal best, but 25 minutes later than what I was aiming for. I was disappointed in the time to be honest. People say I done well.... but I know better. I know I should have got a quicker time, and no one can convince me otherwise. Still the finish time only equates to 25% of the enjoyment of the very well run event.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_04_24-57-LondonMarathon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The medal' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The medal<\/p><p>7:00 min\/km <a href=\"https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/556217628\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"image-icon\" src=\"\/Scripts\/components\/navigation\/images\/strava.png\" \/><\/a><\/p><p>Louise Parker came in a few minutes later. We both struggled to walk up the Mall. We collected a goody bag, but I was in no shape to look at it. I needed some food and drink. Thinking about it. I barely ate anything during the past 5 hours.

There were lots of staff on the tills.<\/p><p>First ride was on the sedate rocket ride. One of the oldest on the park. Ben and Daddy went on the Ice Blast, the ride that shoots you up 210 feet vertically at an inordinate velocity. Ben was scared. You could tell by the noises that came from him. They weren't from a cool, 'I can handle dad', Ben. We then went on the Grand National, a favourite of mum's. We then split, mummy, daddy and Ben went on Infusion, the vampire equivalent ride, that went upside down and very fast. It felt as if we were in one roll into the next. Again Ben loved it. Not as scary add he thought. Katie and Jess went too Nickelodeon World and went on a Blue Flyer coaster. Then it was time for the Big One.... or Pepsi Max in old money. Daddy was worried. Speed is what does him in these days. Ben sat on the back car with him, with mummy just in front. The long climb up is the worst, followed by arching the summit, the 90 degree twist, then woosshhh. 85mph. Best ride off the day.<\/p><p>So many more rides as the queues were reasonably short. Avalanche, a coaster seemingly not running on rails, a toboggan ride. Revolution, loop the loop backwards and the disappointing  Red Arrows Skyforce ride, where you could control when you went upside down..... except Ben's arms were not long enough to control this! The girls got soaked on the watery Valhalla ride. They were scared stiff as by this time darkness had fallen and the ride was in pitch black going down into water! We ended about 6pm, headed to the nearest chip shop, sort of looked at the illuminations. The traffic awful to drive down the seafront so decided to make the 5 hour journey home.

First a walk around the ground and get loads of photos. We got told off when Ben climbed and sat on the Charlton, Law, Best statue. Still we got a photo. The Reds cafÃ© was awesome, just because each of the back of the chairs had a Man Utd legend on the back. Small things and all that. No Schmichael or Olsen though!<\/p><p>We were too engrossed in the museum and missed our tour time slot! Fortunately we got on the next one, ten minutes later. We started by going up in to the Alex Fergusson stand and sitting on the seats viewing the stadium for the first time. You could see Ben was in awe of the size of the place. We had a couple of good tour guides and visited the dressing rooms, 3 areas of the seating, the tunnel, the press conference room, where the directors hang out and sit in the dug out seats. Really good. We loved the 90 minute tour. We visited the megastore and bought some sweatbands and captains armband before re-visiting the museum once again briefly.<\/p><p>We all met up again mid-afternoon and set off for Manchester City Centre and the Arndale Centre. Daddy's next treat was a Topps Match Attax swapping event! Ben indulged in a Match Attax game against some other poor kid, who got pummelled 14-1 by Ben. He got a packet of cards for his troubles.

After about 45 minutes of doing more laps, the boys eventually found the bike hire place. Made difficult as there were TV crews, police cordons and barriers blocking the path to the bike hire place. All we wanted was three bikes! Anyway, Slop got stuck in the middle of the refugees passage, so began walking where the refugees walked. A policeman called him back, but he continued down into the hallway of the station hoping to find an exit.

We went high in the stands, in the dressing rooms, down the tunnel, the press conference area, and pitch side.

We did some laps. Baz spent Â£20 on about 10 prawns. Next stop HofbrÃ¤uhaus, a famous drinking establishment once frequented by Hitler! There was a Oompa Loompa band and some more stiens.... or in E'ster case, small Radlers (shandy). Apparently saving himself for a big session in the evening! Did that ever happen?<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_09_05-400-MunichTour_Day2_Hofbrauhaus.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Hofbrauhaus' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Hofbrauhaus<\/p><p>Baz got chatting to a hen party.... and managed to come out with his nails varnished in bright red! Dawg brought to the table another drinking game, something a little simpler than counting hopefully so Bazza wouldn't be drinking the kitty dry. Played with cards, each number on the card had a separate rule. The best was the Jack where if the 'Jack' person asked a question you were not allowed to answer. This seemed to trip Dawg up the most surprisingly.<\/p><p>After a couple of litres of ale, E'ster and Dawg went back to the hostel for a kip and to put makeup on, whilst the hardcore drinkers moved on to the Hard Rock cafÃ©.... and it was Queen day. Music to Slop's ears. Another beer and a short later and the 3 boys were sold by this a girl a rickshaw ride to Ned Kelly's. What a ride. The poor girl didn't know what had hit her. They shouted out 'Move it or lose it sister' to the unsuspecting public. Plenty of noise. Then Jonah forgot his jumper, so she had to turn back. By the end of the 15 minute journey the girl was out of breathe. She was rewarded well though. The infamous 5 were back together. Ned Kelly's and England v San Marino and another beer. A largely uneventful game, other than the 6 goals that is! Mikey still warming up his drinking arm.<\/p><p>We returned to the Wombats. Slop was in the communal area testing the hammocks out. The opportunity was too great for Bazza who tipped Slop on to his head and dragged him to the side of the hall. Others in the room were horrified. Slop and Bazza were sniggering like little school children. We claimed our free drinks at the Wombats Bar. Bazza tried out a bit of pole dancing. It didn't last long when he struggled to lift himself up.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_09_05-600-MunichTour_Day2_Hostel.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'><\/p><p>Next some laps.

Others have put it down as 40th birthday celebration! Daddy, Michael, Steven, Nick and Barrie or Slop, E'ster, Dawg, Kingster and Bazza all decided to go to Munich for a long weekend. It started with taxis from Messrs Papa Gay and Papa Barnett. A 6:30am departure for a meet at Heathrow Terminal 2. E'ster having not travelled much did not managed to comprehend that a nearly empty shower gel in a 250ml bottle will not get through security. Despite being told, he tried to sneak it through. He got stopped and had to empty his bag. The hi-jonx had already started. Baz left his e-cigarette pipe thing behind. Fortunately E'ster picked it up. Of course not letting on. We saw Baz running around looking for it.... yes Bazza actually running. He was desperate. Having left his bag unattended, a rummage through the bag saw an interesting pair of shoes which Slop took for later! the first beers were served up at 8am. <\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_09_04-107-MunichTour_Day1_Airport.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='8am beer at Terminal 2' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>8am beer at Terminal 2<\/p><p>Then came the flight.... It was only 2 hours. Man alive it was incident filled. We all sat together. First off, Baz was showing some videos on his phone which the woman in front of us appreciated! Then a trolley came around with drinks and food..... Beer number 2. More than one drink could be ordered.... so Slop had a coffee and orange juice. It didn't go too well. The coffee was spilt everywhere! Then Dawg proceeded to spill his beer and Bazza his orange juice on the person sat next to him!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_09_04-200-MunichTour_Day1_Aeroplane.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Plane mess' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Plane mess<\/p><p>Bazza went to the toilet and got stuck between the trolleys going up the gangway. Whilst he was waiting he cheekily asked for another beer!... Unsurprisingly his wish was granted, so was drinking beer at 9am on the gangway. This opened the floodgates for the rest of the plane to order subsequent beers!<\/p><p>On ordering the third beer, E'ster decided to get up and go to the toilet. Shuffling along Slop left his foot out on the gangway which tripped up the air stewardess who was serving the beer. Then E'ster wouldn't take the beer as he got up waiting to get out to the toilet. The male steward then came over, an excused Slop of purposely tripping up the air stewardess. As E'ster didn't take the beer there was a stand off between giving and receiving the beer. It got a bit tense for a bit. We were not ideal passengers I suspect. This coupled with Baz getting his suitcase down for the umpteenth time looking for his e-cigarettes we were right pains in the necks!<\/p><p>We arrived.... first a chance to change footwear... By the way Bazza never got to wear his winkle pickers over the whole trip!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_09_04-215-MunichTour_Day1_Aeroplane.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Nice shoes' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Nice shoes<\/p><p>Baz struck up a conversation with passport control.....<\/p><ul><li>Passport Controller: ... in Bazzas ears he thought he said 'Are you from Bracknell?'.

The room was clean and reasonably spacious. Bazza now lost some additional filters or something. He was all over the place. After the hardship of making our own beds we wandered out to E'sters first stop, Botanischen Garten, a beer garden and our first stiens. Baz could not handle it anymore. He needed nicotine. Just before plundering 10 euros into the cigarette machine, his true whereabouts of his e-cig thing were revealed!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_09_04-300-MunichTour_Day1_BotanischenGarten.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Botanischen Garten' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Botanischen Garten<\/p><p>We caught a tram to Hirschgarten for another beer and some sausage!

Germany v Poland in a Euro qualifier. We needed a good football bar. Thankfully the research before we left led us going to the Stadion. A busy pub with a reserved bench in front of the TV just for us. Like clockwork. We got chatting to some locals. Some of us were flagging under the weighty stiens. Still it didn't stop some.... in fact some accelerated the consumption rate.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_09_04-500-MunichTour_Day1_Stadion.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Stadion' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Stadion<\/p><p>....

So we pushed the heavy trolley up to that end thinking all car rentals must be together. 'Auto Rent' however were not. You guessed it. They were up the other end of the airport building, out the door and in car park 4. Pushing a heavy trolley in jeans in that heat, negotiating all the humps. bumps, curbs and oblivious people was not a fun experience. There was a portacabin finally we'd got there. Nope. So the second tier, local established firms operated out of here. Not 'Auto Rent'. This is where we picked the mini-bus up where the grumpy driver drove us 2 miles down to the road to the car yard. Unperturbed, the kids were excited about getting a new car. Apparently they wanted the white car... the kind man duly obliged and we were off...... off in the wrong direction initially, but at least we were moving. Set on the correct road out of Faro, we soon hit a 'road closed' sign. We were forced off onto the local roads. No diversion signs, no map, a choice of two directions running at right angles to the original road. It was literally a coin toss on which way to go. We turned left, eventually saw a town sign, got the mobile phone out and looked at Google Maps to see which way to go. Eventually we re-joined the main road again and headed towards Albuferia.<\/p><woops woopstitle=\"Driving on wrong side of road, two on coming cars and woman trying to undertake!\" rating=\"6\"><p>After over an hours driving we ended up in the jungle of villas to the east of Albuferia. We had a map, no road name. Portugal don't believe in road name signs or town signs. It is always difficult to know where you are. Every road looks to the same, there are no distinguishing features. We were going around in circles in the right area. Anyway after another U-turn in a side road, daddy unconsciously drove in 'English' mode. Was on the left hand side of the road. Turned out of the junction left, continued slow-ish for about 20 yards. All of a sudden, two oncoming cars appear. Ahhh. We're on the wrong side of the road. Without checking, daddy steered right (onto the correct side of the road), however, some woman was trying to overtake, so as we pulled across we cut her up. She slammed her brakes on, tyres squealing on her car, the smell of rubber masked the other smells which may have slipped out! The woman raised her arms in exasperation. Daddy, sheepishly pulled away. I would question why the woman was trying to overtake when she saw a daft foreigner on the wrong side of the road!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_07_28-10-Portugal-Day1.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Driving wrong side of road' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Driving wrong side of road<\/p><p>After Google Maps told us where we were, we quickly found the villa.

We've been sold a pup.<\/p><p>Whilst we were climbing \/ playing \/ mucking around with the gate, Katie managed to 'unlock' it. The property from the outside was gorgeous. Next, the front door - locked. The key inside a mini-safe which we didn't have the paperwork for! Suspected that Daddy threw it away. A call back to Gemma and she gave a few numbers to try. BINGO.

Albuferia was a lovely large town. Yes it was 100% aimed at tourists with gift shops and bars, but as long as you had that in mind, it was a lovely setting. No drunks, or beggers or hard salesman. It was reasonably cheap as well, probably due to the strong pound. We decided to stop and eat at a traditional Portuguese eating parlour. Well if Daddy had his way, however it was a Hamburger Restaurant we stopped at. At this point was really suffering in hindsight with exhaustion. It had been a long day, with the heat and the crutches it all took it's toll. Drakness descended and we headed back to the villa for a much needed good night's sleep.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_07_28-15-Portugal-Day1.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Exploring the streets of Albuferia' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Exploring the streets of Albuferia<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Portugal Holiday - Day 1 - Getting there"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":26,"m":7,"y":2015},"datev":20150726,"first":{"value":null},"info":{"content":"<p>Dani, one of Katie's friends who came to her party, invited Katie to her sisters 18th birthday.

Picked up by the Fars and taken to the River Thames for a nice Ice Cream. Then they went the scenic route to Wycombe Air Park where they met us!<\/p><p>This is the gliding club that Uncle Ron used to fly at. A couple of his friends were around Michael and Bob, who spoke warmly of Ron. Bob was taking Daddy up in a two seater glider... and letting him have a go on the controls. Both Mummy and Katie were scared stiff, Ben and Katie were a little braver. We all walked onto the grass airfield and saw Daddy being briefed and dressed for the occasion. He was sat the front with all the dials and joystick in front of him.<\/p><p>Take off time. The aeroplane pulled away dragging Daddy and Bob along. Katie was in tears, Mummy laughing in nervousness, Ben and Jess loving the adventure. They were towed to a height of 3000 metres at 70mph. All of a sudden the rope was disengaged which was a little disconcerting at first, but once everything had stabilized it was a relaxing experience.<\/p><div class=\"youtube\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ga9TcL4v9Mk\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/div><p> The speed dropped to 50mph and on average they we losing height at 1 metre per second, so gradual you couldn't tell. At times you could feel a gust of wind blow you, or feel a thermal push you up. It was the skill of the pilot to find the thermal, by looking for black clouds or rises from a hill. Daddy had a go on the controls, both steering left and right and controlling the nose pitch. Daddy could see Wycombe, Maidenhead and Stokenchurch quite easily. A house from Grand Designs sunk into the ground was close by as well as the straight stretch of Thames leading to Henley. London could be seen in the distance. Daddy was up in the sky for about 25 minutes before a fast approach to land. Bob skilfully landed the plane smoothly considering the uneven grass field.<\/p><p>Daddy received a certificate for his efforts.<\/p><p>After we all went to the Kings Head in Little Marlow for a meal treated by the Fars.

Importantly as well is the way in which he walks. Up till now he has been using the crutches and before that tip toeing on his right leg. He really now has to start putting his heal down flat as he walks in his air boot, assisted with a crutch. The physio lady is going to see us again in just over a week's time, but she did emphasise how important it is to be disciplined at keeping the hourly sessions going.

Over the past two weeks Ben has been getting more and more anxious about it. How much will it hurt afterwards was the main question. Whilst Daddy stayed at home to get Katie and Jessica to school, Mummy and Ben left at 5:50am heading to Stanmore. The orthopaedic hospital takes patients from all over the south of England. It's the best place to have his leg looked after.<\/p><p>So a reminder of the actual problem. I'm not sure of the technical term. Ben has a malformation of arteries just behind and below the knee. This has resulted in a pool of fluid, be it blood, fat, water meaning that there is pressure on his nerves resulting in him tip-toeing for the past year. Fibrous tissue has been growing as a result further complicating matters.<\/p><p>Mummy and Ben were not long at the hospital before they were called to prepare for the operation which was due shortly. At 8:45 Ben was wheeled into the operating theatre where the main consultant, Mr Pollock greeted him. In all there were 2 consultants, 2 registrars, 2 anaesthetists and 3 or 4 nurses. About 10 health care professionals in all.<\/p><p>Ben was given anaesthetic and put to sleep. The surgeons cut away the fibrous tissue and a slice of muscle, re-routed the veins or arteries and released the fluid. Apparently there will be a 2 inch scare where they entered. A backslab was put on, and loads of bandages. Mummy waited in the chapel and prayed, Daddy arrived from home and joined Mummy.<\/p><p>At 10:45, 2 hours later, Mummy and Daddy were called to the recovery room. As soon as they entered, all they could here were screams and howls of pain. Their fears were realized as they saw Ben in a lot of distress and pain. So much, that his voice was very crackly. The anaesthetist was there along with a nurse. The anaesthetist was trying to get Ben to describe what and where the pain was. Ben was saying that he couldn't move his leg.... and that the cast was digging into him. The anaesthetist said there is not normally this amount of pain. Daddy froze. He was holding Ben's hand, but couldn't speak. He began sweating and the anaesthetist was worried that he'd pass out. Mummy was in a similar state. She had to sit down as she said the room was spinning around. They felt helpless. The anaesthetist was brilliant as he had 3 of us to contend with.... as well as trying to convince a junior member of staff the amount of anaesthetic to inject. Ben was in this very distressed state for 10 minutes until a 'generous' amount morphine, was injected. Ben was still in distress as he slowly fell asleep in the next 5 minutes still complaining about the pain. Mummy and Daddy could breathe again, stand-up and talk. It was hard to take in everything the anaesthetist and one of the surgeons was saying. Basically the operation went to plan. It was hard to say what the medium term effects are going to be. A lot of physio will be required. In the short term, all options are open including going back to re-adjust the backslab or going to HDU. Fortunately he was discharged back to the ward having been asleep for 15 to 30 minutes. Don't really get a sense of time in these situations.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_06_30-01-BensLegOperation.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Wheeled out of recovery by the porters' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Wheeled out of recovery by the porters<\/p><p>He came around slowly in the ward, fortunately not screaming. Not too comfortable, but at least not in great distress. In the next hour or two, progress was fast and good. It still hurt but Ben managed to crack a smile. We were looked after by the Sister, a physiotherapist came around to give Ben his crutches, which he had been asking for on countless occasions. Eager to get on. Ben didn't like the catheters and drain in him and wanted to get them off soon. He tried eating some bread, but his throat hurt too much and was unable to swallow. This is probably because a fat tube is put down the throat in order to get the airwaves open in theatre. However, he managed some strawberry ice cream and a little later some chocolate. They could take off his catheter as he proved he was not going to be sick.

Everyone had to order their own lunch in French, and then we met up again for the short walk to the aquarium.\u000aInside, we saw all kinds of sea-dwelling creatures, including stingrays, sharks, sawfish and seahorses.

Daddy won 40p in the penultimate race and got fed up of the favourite always winning, so placed a Â£5 bet on the final race which came in. As he won, he had to buy Bazza a beer!

A 250 metre climb from sea level.... and you guessed it. The weather conditions turned for the worse. The climb was long, but the wind was not as strong as the previous day. A pair of mountains, Quinag and Spidean Coinich hugged the road as it wound all the way up to the summit. A period of flat before descending to Loch Assynt and a stop off at Ardvreck Castle. This was Nick and Michael's favourite section of the holiday.<\/p><p>Ardvreck Castle provided a physical challenge. A jump across the water to the Castle which sat on an island in the loch. All in all, everyone got a wet foot, although no one seemed to admit it. The boys mucked about in the castle for a bit. Again time was marching on. They had progressed even slower than yesterday! They had 10 miles remaining to reach the bunkhouse at Altnacealgach. The scenery was a little less interesting in comparison with what was seen in the previous 36 hours.<\/p><p>An English couple ran the Bunkhouse in the most remote of locations. They were shown their bunk beds, one each. There was plenty of room, but again there was little radiator space.

Unfortunately the stay was tarnished at the end, as they were set to cycle off up the hill. Lesley had spotted that Nick had left the Rockets Teapot behind! She quizzed over it's origin. Lesley, a formidable opponent made Nick wilt and he confessed that Caledonian Railways had supplied such a fine piece of kitchenware!

The bright sunshine was quickly replaced by a sleet storm which lasted 10 minutes. Daddy stuck on some blue polythene gloves, similar to those found in petrol station forecourts. His hands were absolutely freezing and stung so badly as he raced down Bettyhill. The gloves helped insulate against the wind chill and wet. A lifesaver. Michael had the luxury of plastic bag socks!<\/p><p>The three were soon into one of the biggest hills of the trip, climbing up into no mans land, aka Borgie. The wind was blowing really hard. It was a struggle to go down hills. Tongue was bypassed in favour of a costal shortcut across the Kyle Of Tongue bridge. Again spectacular landscape, with people fly fishing in the estuary. Past the bridge, an even bigger hill, which required a stop at the top and a well deserved egg and bacon sandwich. Only a third of the distance covered, it was going to be a long day. As they were cycling into the wind, they could see the weather ahead of them. Doomsday beckoned.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_05_16-42-Scotland-Day2-FarrToKinlochbervie.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Kyle Of Tongue Bridge' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Kyle Of Tongue Bridge<\/p><p>The skies were grey and thick with rain. What the boys hadn't seen was the hail and increased winds. It felt like someone was throwing ice in your face. The bikes were being blown all over the road which was a shame as they could not take full advantage of the down hills. Both Nick and Michael almost crashed into the side of the road. The 21 miles to Durness sign was passed  - no one dared stop. It was a case of getting to any form of shelter. Soon a disused church was found in Eriboll. Daddy went to open the door.... It was like the 64 million dollar question.... there was suspense - drum roll please. Was it going to be open? No, it was locked. Oh dear.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_05_16-54-Scotland-Day2-FarrToKinlochbervie.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Outside the church in Eriboll' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Outside the church in Eriboll<\/p><p>It was a shame that the weather spoilt the views and enjoyment of Loch Eriboll. It is one of the most picturesque scenes with a large expanse of water almost surrounded by mountains and the tiny road. The boys sought refuge in a welcomed tea shop. Shivering through the door, a round of teas and cakes were ordered as they stripped off their wet clothes and sidled up to the heaters to dry out tops, socks and gloves. The weather passed and the troops climbed out of their bunker to hit the north coast run into Durness stopping at some lovely Atlantic scenes. They watched birds dive bombing into the sea to catch fish. Quite amazing.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_05_16-59a-Scotland-Day2-FarrToKinlochbervie.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Beach near Rispond' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Beach near Rispond<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_05_16-71a-Scotland-Day2-FarrToKinlochbervie.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Rispond Plage' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Rispond Plage<\/p><p>6pm. Durness and a stop for supplies from a shopkeeper who looked surprised that they had to still got a trip into Kinlochbervie. Again conditions were horrendous along the 8 mile up hill stretch, passing Daddy's Kyle of Durness. The strong head wind was joined by a hail storm! They all stopped in the middle of the road, with no shelter, and turned their backs against the horizontal deluge of ice from the sky! Daddy found it tough going. Amazingly earlier in the day, proper athletes ran a marathon along this very route. They must have gone faster than what the boys were achieving. A penguin waddled passed them at one point such were the conditions and speed!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_05_16-23-Scotland-Day2-FarrToKinlochbervie.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Kyle of Durness' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Kyle of Durness<\/p><p>Finally after ten and a half hours on the road, at 8:30pm the Old School House was reached. A modest 60 miles covered in that time. The room was small and basic but clean enough. Team morality was chucked to one side and it was obvious who was after all the radiator real estate! After a quick freshen up, the boys went across to the accompanying restaurant where there was a hen party in full swing! A tough day was rewarded by a nice round of fish and chips and a beer.

Opening the blind in the morning, Daddy was treated to remote, snow capped, mountain views and sunshine. What a way to be greeted in the morning. Then Daddy was exposed to a smelly trumpet in the adjoining room! The next station was Aviemore. There was just an hour to eat the Smoked Salmon and Scrambled Egg breakfast and take in the views before getting off at Inverness. The boys had a couple of hours to kill, so a quick look at Trip Advisor and a Bike CafÃ© was located and the second breakfast order went in. It was a strange setup. The cafÃ© had the most limited range of food; toast, cake, Granola or fruit. The bike part of the cafÃ© constituted a room around the back, where a job interview was taking place. Daddy chuckled as the toilet was right next to the interview - chemical warfare was declared. I wonder how many interviews had been infected with that before? Nick went to buy a much needed jacket which would turn out to be one of his best purchases in a long while.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_05_15-00-Scotland-Day1-LairgToFarr.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Route' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Route<\/p><p>12:30 and the train rolls into Lairg from Inverness. Finally biking can commence. Today a 49 mile trek northwards. The boys started off confidently, Daddy only wearing the Rockets top. There was a tail wind which made the climb very easy. They were all wondering what the fuss was about. Mountains were seen in the distance. The road was long and reasonably straight, interrupted by the odd cattle grid and speeding motorist. It was a joy to ride. The weather soon turned. A jacket and thick biking top was needed over the Rockets top to stave off the drop in temperature and rain. Thankfully, the Altnaharra Hotel was the boys saviour. A warm chocolate cake and good cup of tea soon perked up the chaps. One cake soon turned into two. The carrot cake was almost as good as the chocolate. Sometimes the thick accent was hard to understand on the friendly and chatty locals, many of whom seemed to have worked south west of London!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_05_15-11-Scotland-Day1-LairgToFarr.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Nick and Daddy heading north' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Nick and Daddy heading north<\/p><p>A turn to the right at the crossroads and the boys continued north along Loch Naver and the River Naver. Birds of prey were spotted. Claims of it being an eagle were a little dubious. The Loch turned into a river which was followed all the way to the coast. A race to the top of the next hill materialized with a point being awarded to the polkadot champ. About a dozen hills were tackled before reaching the mouth of the river on the north coast. Then Mr King and Mr Elder were in a no holds barred race to the top of Bettyhill. Nick raced ahead. Michael came up on the inside. Sensing the danger, Nick 'closed' the space. Michael forged ahead and try to bulldoze through. Nick slammed the door shut, bolted it and threw away the key. BANG. A clash of metal. Both cyclists ended up in the middle of the road on the floor claiming it was each others fault. It just so happened the only two yobbos in north Scotland were hanging out in the bus shelter absolutely besides themselves with laughter. A chant of 'She fell over' echoed over the crash scene. Daddy was in stitches having a grandstand view 20 metres behind.<\/p><p>Fortunately there was no serious damage. A graze to ones skin, bike and pride was about the sum of it. The toughest two miles of biking was still to come to end the day's riding. First passing an open fish and chip shop without going in was hard, then some proper up hill gradients were experienced out of Bettyhill towards Farr. They arrived about 6:30pm at Farr Cottage and was welcomed by Lesley.<\/p><p>Three hungry boys sat down at the dinner table to the best fish pie ever, consisting of salmon, haddock, cod, hard boiled egg, potato and cheese sauce followed by rhubarb crumble. Lesley was relaying tales of past customers, local MPs help, drug running and the northern lights. An interesting lady. The views over Farr Bay into the distance along the coast line were stunning. The boys were not in the most talkative moods and turned into their bedrooms at 9:30 for a good night's kip.<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Day 1 - Scotland Biking - Lairg to Farr (79km)"},"version":5},{"date":{"d":14,"m":5,"y":2015},"datev":20150514,"first":{"value":null},"images":1,"info":{"content":"<p>Seven years ago Daddy went on a motorbike tour around north Scotland and was captured by it's remoteness and beauty and vowed one day to return..... So he did with his Bike and two friends, Michael and Nick. Typically, it was a self managed holiday. The routes and overnight stops all booked up in advance. Hilly terrain and weather conditions will more than make up for the shorter mileage compared with the London to Paris trip. There was nervousness whether they'd all done enough training for the trip.<\/p><p>Thursday, after Michael stopped laughing at Daddy's rack mount, an hour before departure from our house, Jonah rings to say the traffic is terrible and he's going to struggle to make it for the latest leaving time! Before we even start the Jonah strikes. Farfar, the taxi driver, was able to pick him up en-route, through rush-hour traffic to Euston station with bikes strapped to the back of the car. Nick basically spent 4 hours getting from Reading to Euston. As a last minute choice, the boys decided to upgrade to first class sleeping accommodation. They were pushed for time which was made worse by the later than expected arrival and the need to pick up the tickets from an unhelpful man behind the desk. He remarked 'your train is about to leave' as he glanced at his watch. Such an insight to our time pressure was not appreciated as Daddy grabbed the tickets and marched with purpose to Coach J where the bikes were to be stored for the next 11 hours and 500 miles.<\/p><p>Settling into the sleeping compartment, Daddy was relieved they were under way. A tour of the longest train in the world was required, in search for the luxurious 'lounge car' which was advertised on Caledonians website. They walked miles it seemed with no luck. When challenged as to the whereabouts of the car, the barman was dismissive and said that it was different rolling stock to the one currently used. Ahhh. The poorer version the boys were standing in was fully occupied. So there was no choice but to take the beers back to the sleeping compartment and chill. Daddy and Michael's rooms had interconnecting doors, which once opened were open for good, much to Michael's horror when Daddy wanted the blind left open all night! It's like someone shining their full beam headlights into your eyes was the remark. Sleep was hard to come by. Sanity was also slowly slipping away as Daddy became really anxious about the train crashing. He was bracing himself around every corner, thinking they were going on two wheels and over every set of points. What would happen if the wheels did not align properly on the tracks and we left the rails at such high speed? Tiredness fortunately prevailed and broken sleep was attained for the best part of the journey north.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_05_14-05-Scotland-Day0-TrainToInverness.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='First Class Sleeping Compartment' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>First Class Sleeping Compartment<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Day 0 - Scotland Biking - Train from Euston"},"version":5},{"date":{"d":10,"m":5,"y":2015},"datev":20150510,"first":{"value":null},"images":1,"info":{"content":"<p>Daddy went on a final training test run with all the kit.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_05_12-01-LondonBikeRide.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Oh dear - netting tangled in wheel' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Oh dear - netting tangled in wheel<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"London Bike Ride"},"version":5},{"date":{"d":9,"m":5,"y":2015},"datev":20150509,"first":{"value":null},"images":5,"info":{"content":"<p>We decided to go for a new course today, Thames Valley Park, Reading.

It was quite amazing to see all the craters. Absolutely loads. The trenches were not lined up perfectly in a straight line. They seemed to go all over the place.

The wind and rain really didn't invite us to step outside, so we had to resort to plan B this morning. But before that we had the embarrassment of breakfast and Ben, or should I say Mr. Fusspot. I don't like this, was the general response. For Daddy and Farfar they curiously had a single fried egg present to them on a plate. Luckily there was a bread basket to accompany this. Strange.<\/p><p>Plan B involved us driving south to Amiens, the nearest city and finding the Piscine Le Nautlus. Farfar decided to sit out this one which was fortunate as Daddy was not allowed to wear his Bermuda type shorts in the swimming pool. So Daddy donned Farfar's parachute which had elasticated laces to tighten around the waste. Phew. Anyway Farfar went to the viewing gallery and read more about the Somme whilst Daddy was attempting to through Ben off the mats for an hour or so.<\/p><p>We ventured around the city to find a patisserie. Daddy thinks they are better than even Danish baker shops. We eventually found one with life up and down the street! We parked up French styley, i.e. just found the nearest half space, and put the order in for a range of cakes and tarts. They were demolished pretty quick!<\/p><p>We crossed the Somme, northward and headed for Albert. Here there was a WWI museum which we ventured into. It was an underground museum with many artefacts found in the local area. Again all very interesting, Ben absorbing the information for about 90 minutes. Ben was desperate to get something from the gift shop, not only for Mummy, Jess and Katie, but also for himself.

We headed to the nearby Thiepval, where there was some heavy fighting and many casualties, especially on the first day of the Battle Of The Somme, July 1st 1916. There are many good accounts on YouTube. Anyway there was another museum and memorial. A modern museum which we rounded. We went to the memorial on top of the hill. It was hard to take the significance of it all, as the wind was absolutely blowing so hard. It started to blow the wreaths off that had been laid many months before. We had to quickly retreat back to the car.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_03_29-23-WWI-France-Day2-Albert.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Thiepval memorial' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Thiepval memorial<\/p><p>We drove around where the front lines were. All farms. We went passed the first place where tanks were ever used in battle, in 1918. The landscape looked pretty unscathed, we couldn't see mud and trenches, except from one place, the Lochnagar Crater. We visited this. The British tunnelled under no man's land and planted explosives which when detonated could be heard in London it is reported. It made a whacking great hole on July 1st. Quite impressive.<\/p><p>The weather and our stomachs were beating us, so we headed back into Albert, found a restaurant and had dinner. Well sort of. Daddy, ever the adventurous one order a tripe sausage. It was disgusting. The smell was the worst thing, which didn't help eating the rest of the meal. The burger that Ben order was smothered in cheese, which he didn't like. Still he ate most of the rest of it.

Ben read his Harry Potter book for most of the way. We stopped at Maidstone for a Costa and a stretch of the legs. Dover was packed out with lorries and many cars. There were over 200 lanes to queue for the ferry. We boarded and left of time.<\/p><p>The journey was a bit roly-poly, but a fried breakfast soon helped settle the stomach. There was a thick fog also, which meant we couldn't see much when we went out on deck. The captain was blowing the horn every 2 minutes, I guess as a way of saying, 'I am here, get out of my way'.<\/p><p>We crossed the busiest shipping lanes in the world unscathed, and we were on French soil. First stop was the 90 minute car journey to Agincourt. The place where we gave the arrogant French a punch on the nose. As we passed through the many villages we all noticed the lack of life. We barely saw a person walking on the pavement, riding a bike or anything really. It was quite eerie. They were ghost towns. Agincourt was a tiny village which had a modern museum in it's centre. Again, we were the only customers in the museum, so had the place to ourselves. Basically the French thought they'd destroy Henry V's army as they returned to England. Aware of this, Henry set a mini trap, funnelling the vast quantities of French infantry and cavalry through the mud which our long bowman exploited. Ben seemed to absorb much of the information. He enjoys learning about things like this. The museum had a miniature scene which helped us visualize the battlefield. It had armour, weapons and some short films which we watched. We were there for about 90 minutes before moving on to circling the battlefield which is now a farmers field.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_03_28-21-WWI-France-Day1-Agincourt.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Agincourt Museum - Armour' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Agincourt Museum - Armour<\/p><p>The battlefield now just looks like any other field.

He wanted to run as he felt and not to the watch.<\/p><p>After about 2 miles sweat was pouring down and Daddy had a pins and needles, numb type sensation down his left leg which was not a good sign. He persisted on. The crowds down Fleet High Street were amazing. Definitely worth sticking your name on the shirt so people can shout your name. The Sanders crew were there cheering on, so Daddy high fived them as he passed.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_03_22-01-FleetHalfMarathon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'><\/p><p>After mile 5, the crowds dissipated and the run really began. It was mentally tough. Lee and Duncan, who was struggling, over took me as I walked and took on water. I continued and at mile 8 I was really struggling and couldn't see anything but a jog walk ending. However, the gel I took, kicked in and along with some jelly babies which were handed out, I was back in the land of living and ready to kick on. 1 hour 30 mins at mile 10, and Lee and I were on a mission. We passed loads of people, no one passed us. Daddy thought he had stolen an unassailable lead. However, with 400 metres to go Lee nonchalantly zoomed passed. Daddy didn't think he had anything left in the tank, but from somewhere the boosters came on and he sprinted the final 200 metres. Strava said it was his 2nd quickest 400m time! Crazy. Anyway the final official time was 1:55:53 which was a new pb!

Let's get trading. But into what? Well the decision was made to bet against the Euro. The recent 1.1 trillion pumped into quantative easing, making exports more attractive was weakening the currency. Conversely, quantative easing in the US had just finished and an announcement that interest rates are set to rise has meant that bonds are more attractive making the dollar stronger.<\/p><p>So to the trading platform, Barclays Stockbrokers, and first up I am bamboozled by the units, 1,10,25,50,100. Still now I am not sure what they represent, but eventually I plump for going short on the Euro by 100. Immediately I am Â£300 down just on the spread price. Within minutes that is recovered and things look good. Up a 100, 500, 1000 pounds all quite quickly. In fact by the end of the day I've 'made' Â£6,500! Not bad for a day's work. The proceeding day also a good one. Up to Â£12000. Wednesday went nuts. At one point mid-morning I was up Â£24,000.... In two a half days trading. This was the high point. I think I eventually sold at a profit of Â£18,0000. Over the next couple of days it ebbed and flowed, fininshing the week on a Â£10,000 profit.... which in one respect is disappointing looking at what could have been, but on the other hand it is Â£10000 more than I had the previous week, which you can complain about.<\/p><p>So I have learnt a great deal of lessons over the week. First, it's no good putting in so much money, such that in an hour your profit\/loss varies by Â£7000 in an hour! For one it is not good for the heart, secondly it is too short term as a downward turn can trigger the margin limit and an automatic sell, even though you know it is a temporary blip.<\/p><p>Two, deffo only put in, what you can afford to lose.... I was incredibly lucky and went in at the right moment. If I was looking at a Â£5000 loss, then what would Laura think. What would Ron think. He worked hard for that money and I just waste it in days. It needs to be respected. It is so easy to fall into a computer game mode, where you don't see the money physically, it's just considered monopoly money.<\/p><p>Gambling and greed, or considered investment and the want to capitalize. A fine line. I questioned myself a lot over the week. How much was enough? Why did I feel quite low, despite getting a healthy profit? Was it right to using this money in this way? Questions I still not sure I know the answer to.<\/p><p>Market downturn why? I am not sure for the past 5 trading days since, the dollar has got stronger. There does not seem to be any news to explain this.... I can understand a 1 day blip, but 5 days? What does the future hold for the currency? The love affair with this is over. Did I invest a bit too long in this because I had nothing else to jump to. Really I need a portfolio of stuff. Don't get emotionally attached.

This time he was going to go under a general anaesthetic and have a biopsy done at the back of his right knee. Having woken at 5am and left at 5:35am we made it in good time. No traffic really. Various staff came around and ask questions, talked through the procedure, all very nice. Mummy was very anxious and could only be involved sometimes. Daddy was there also to help me through.<\/p><p>We had some time to kill so Ben and Daddy went to the Day Room and played some pool. This was Ben's first attempt.... and of course he is as cack-handed as his father. After a bit of practice, Ben was getting the hang of it. We had company and a teenager called Michael played against Ben and Daddy. We got to the end stages and Ben was called in. Some anaesthetic cream was applied and cling-filmed down. At the last minute, we were told to go to the ultra sound department. This sent Mummy into meltdown as this was not the plan. Daddy and Ben saw a senior radiologist who was very nice and examined Ben's leg again. He managed to diagnose the problem in 10 minutes. Why the previous ultra sound didn't show the same issue is another question. The doctors notes say:<\/p><ul><li>arteriovenous malformation<\/li><li>contains fat and blood vessels<\/li><li>no focal mass<\/li><li>partially compressible<\/li><\/ul><p>So main thing he said it was not cancerous. Mummy found us and gave Kumar, the radiologist and big hug. She was so relived. He said we could go home. No biopsy needed.<\/p><p>So, as Ben has mummy and daddy wrapped around his little finger, we went to the new McDonalds in Farnborough which had tablets at every table. Ben had two burgers! Fatty.<\/p><p>It's felt like a massive weight has come off Mummy and the rest of us. Life can continue again.

Luckily dad was about to help. The car stalled if left idle, so I had to keep pumping the accelerator, pushing the clutch in and the brake to slow down. I cautiously went up the pit lane, a left turn and onto the track. I gave it a bit of welly and even did a few handbrake tests when I went around the corner. I still felt pretty calm. Engines off, I heard the announcer call my name. Gaz was a couple of rows ahead of me. It felt such a long time for the control car to slowly pull away. All engines revving to the max. Angry drivers ready to do battle. We slowly crept around, the marshals were waving us frantically to keep close to each other, down the back straight the cars in front, started to really rev and we were off. The first corner successfully negotiated with a slight nudge here and there. Back to start finish straight and now going full speed. I saw Gaz spun out and almost hit the control car! I was still going around the outside. Woooo the speed. There was a lot of jostling and this is when I knew I was in a banger race. The 'jostling' was quite a shock and thought bloody hell. Anyway I went quicker than I thought I would. I really went for it down the next straight and overtook a few cars that were on the inside. It was snooze and lose. However, I should have eased up as I went too wide on the corner however still survived. Lap 2, and I got smashed from behind which took me hurtling towards the corner wall. I slammed on the brakes, but alas, SMASH. The wall! I got smacked again whilst stationary. My car was stationary. This was not going to be fun as I was in a precarious position at the end of the straight with my drivers door exposed to the oncoming cars. In front of me there was a pile up where a car end up on two wheels! I just had to sit there for the rest of the race as my car had no power. I couldn't start the slop-mobil. Gaz however lasted a few more laps than me before he got spun right next to me.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_31-11-AldershotBanger-Race1.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='End of race 1.

Me and Gaz finish side by side<\/p><p>After the race the car was towed back to the pits and the guys started working on her. The car was 'stretched' back out by use of the crane. The reason I couldn't restart was the power cable had been disconnected. If I had known I could have simply re-attached and gone again. It was nice to speak to friends. They said I didn't look out of place for the little time I was out on track.<\/p><p>RACE 2:<\/p><p>Patched up and out again. Same tactics. Thought if I could survive a few laps I might do alright, and how right I was. The race settled down and I followed Gaz around for a number of laps. I could have taken him out, but wanted to make sure I didn't wreck his car. Wanted him to able to get in a full race. We duelled I eventually finished ahead of him and slowed for the chequered flag. However, that was for the winners, we were at least a lap behind, but I had slowed for the end of the race. Gaz launched himself into me down the back straight. Wallop. Brilliant.

There was quite a number of races until we had our third and final race: Nudge and Spin. Which sounds gentle enough doesn't it? But what it basically means is you have to hit someone in order to pass them, no hit, no pass! A dumbed down version of a DD! Out we go again and I was still bouncing around as if my wheels were oval shaped and rubbed up against the wheel arch. I tried to push start Gaz, but unfortunately his car was not having any of it, and so had to retire before the race had even started. This time I lined up on the grid near the back. A good place to be. The control car peels off and almost instantly I get a heavy whack from behind on the home straight! Loved it. The next few laps were bumpy, I nudge one or two out of the way, then about Lap 5 there was a car ahead going half the speed of me, so wallop I give him the biggest hit I could muster square on the back side! Love it. It felt pretty strong, but I think at the same time someone was behind me, so in effect I was the meat in a sandwich! My car was wrecked, back and front. The other cars got away. Just leaving me. After the initial shock, I tried to get the slop-mobil going again. It wasn't looking good. Then a glimmer of hope, I could hear the engine turning over trying to start. It sounded as if it were drowning. The engine was overheating and steam was emanating from the bonnet. Just as the slop-mobil was going to start. SMASH. Someone hit me hard from behind and by all accounts there was no one else around they took a long run up down the straight and headed square for me! I wasn't even on the track!<\/p><div class=\"youtube\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/CGCi4EubFo4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/div><p>Again a little dazed. I went back to work at starting her up. Success! Woo Hoo. I thought back in the game. Then my heart sank, the car wouldn't move. I tried revving really hard both in forward and backwards gears. Steam was billowing out of the car. Katie was sobbing her eyes out. Mummy was urging me to get out of the car as she thought it was going to blow up!! 12 laps into the race, I resigned to the fact the slop-mobil was dead. Time to dice with death and get out of the car before I was targeted again. There was a gap, so unharnessed myself and ran into the middle of the track and watched the last laps with Gaz.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_31-10-AldershotBanger-Race3.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Looks like I'm gonna take him out' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Looks like I'm gonna take him out<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_31-12-AldershotBanger-Race3.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Aaarghh.

Jessica was a little nervous, but was quick to go down. Katie still had her arm in plaster, so was in internal turmoil. She desperately wanted to go down, but felt she couldn't. It took many failed attempts of sitting on the edge before she eventually took the plunge. Daddy sat at the top and didn't think he could do it. One of those funny things, you know it's OK, and once you've done it, all subsequent turns would be fine.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_07_28-08-Day1-Bowood.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Death slide champion' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Death slide champion<\/p><p>We played on the swings, had our picnic, then went for a walk around the house and grounds. It was a scorching day by now. Jessica remarked to the whole stately home how one of the statues had a willy!!! Thanks Jessica for that. She found it very amusing. The grounds were lovely. A picturesque hill down to the lake and a path which runs to a hidden waterfall which we all had a play in. Katie wanted to protect her arm from the water so put a shopping bag around her arm. Must have looked a little strange to passers by. Anyway the waterfall was great as we could hide behind the tumbling water. Behind that were some unlit caves which were a bit eerie to walk around. We got a family mug shot overlooking the lake and house.

The times still remained on average under the hour. The team had bought themselves 45 minutes. Good work! We all ran 1 lap in the dark. The Solo-ists were still going around. Amazing. We all made sure we gave a 'well done' as we passed them.<\/li><li>3rd Leg - The Sunday morning legs were run in perfect conditions. The crowds came back to support and cheer us on, it wasn't too hot, it was light and dry. Muscles still ached but we were all fit to go again.<\/li><li>Run, Eat and Repeat - They had completed 2 laps more than us, but the wheels had come off. Jen, Phil and Alex were crocked, Tom was exhausted having no sleep, Mark had already ran 40km and the bionic man of David Peddle never knew when he was beat! 20 minutes before his leg, he was cramping badly. How he managed 50km was anyone's guess. They still managed 25 laps in total<\/li><li>Lap 4 - Everything went to plan. The whole team came to greet Sarah in after her 3rd lap, an exchange of banter, and as a team we were all off again, this time at walking pace..... and carrying a clanging money bucket. James' inspired thought which earned another Â£80 for the cause. TR24 competitors and spectators were so supportive. As we trotted (at best) around we swapped stories of near misses, worst hill, best view experiences. The final 1km was truly hair raising. The supporting crowds cheered, the 'Run Eat' team joined us as sprinted up the last hill which didn't seem so bad after all. We linked arms and crossed the finish line, lap 25, as one. A very fitting and emotional finish.<\/li><li>Medals and Photos - .... and more photos. We collected our well deserved medals and posed for photos. James wanted every combination possible.... and of course the jump shot!<\/li><li>Exhausted and Elated - We packed up, said our goodbyes, swapped details with our new TR24 friends, struggled home then went our separate ways.

We managed to catch a glimpse of the terrifying course at 1km. Are we hill climbing?<\/li><li>Race Briefing - At 11:30am we could see all the competitors at the race briefing. There were the brave solo runners, fancy dress runners, casual runners, serious running clubs and charity runners. The excitement and atmosphere were building.<\/li><li>And They're Off... - Captain Duncan was our lead off man. We rushed back to base, about 2km into the circuit. We all cheered loudly and gave high fives as he ran past. 56 minutes later the snap band got passed to Richard to start leg 2. We all waited anxiously for the course report. It was tough, bloody tough: Hills, ruts, tree stumps, single paths and possibly the worst thing was the 28 degree heat! Despite all that Dunc managed a sub 1 hour lap which was good.<\/li><li>Team Support - We had a good process going, we cheered each runner as they passed us at 2km, we had a good hand over strategy and were one of the only teams to have someone to meet and greet with a drink and a pat on the back for the runner just finishing their lap.<\/li><li>Everyone's Lap 1 completed - After Dunc we had coach Richard, speedy Chris who hadn't ran 10km for months, super fit Lee, a nervous Martin who tried a 10km the week before and broke down, then Nick who was secretly competing to do the quickest time, James who also went out with all guns blazing and then finally Sarah who had to wait an agonising 6.5 hours.<\/li><li>Darkness Descends - The temperatures had finally cooled, but the next challenge to take it's place was darkness. Not only that, we had a couple of showers to add to the mix. Nervous laughter echoed around camp FF. Many of the team were running in the dark for the first time. The head torches; a new toy. Most of us turned an ankle at the wooded section at 7km or slipped along the grassy sections. Another challenge, another bit of excitement.

This time Crane Park, Hounslow. A small-ish parkrun. We were first to arrive. Ben started off at a quick pace. Really thought we were on for a PB. However, we misjudged the run a bit. The course was one and a half laps, instead of a normal two. So when we rounded a corner by the finish line we had enough in the tank for another kilometre. Still it was Ben's second best time ever. We were both very happy with this.<\/p><p>They returned home and Daddy's next task was to get ready for a bit of Daddy and daughter time. They both wanted to do a bit of kayaking. The River Abbey was a perfect choice. A circular route, yes even on a river, it had plenty of interesting things to see and challenges to tackle.<\/p><p>They started at Chertsey Bridge and Daddy couldn't quite remember where the entrance to the River Abbey was so they went up and down the Thames a bit passing the same heron three times. It was near the weir which was a bit scary to pass as the waves pushed us into a moored boat. It was a bit dicey for a few seconds, but they powered themselves through and it quickly became all serene. The next task was the tackle the slope by Abbey Chase house. We got out and hauled the kayak up the rollers. We now were officially on the Abbey River. Probably the only craft that's been from end to end for months. The river was banked by lots of vegetation, a lot of it overgrown. Many lilies and bamboo type plants. There were a number of blockages on the route which they had to negotiate. Then there were the low bridges which they had to duck under and the fallen trees. Some were just about passable, one they had to climb onto, use their feet to move the kayak under and then get back in again. All good fun and made it different to a normal boating excursion.<\/p><p>It was a really nice trip. They saw so many nice things together. Their bottoms were getting sore once they had retuned back onto the Thames at Penton Hook, so they stopped off at Laleham for a spot of food and drink.

This was planned to be the final stretch: Greenhithe to Gravesend. The last time Daddy was at Greenhithe Daddy was soaked have rolled the kayak at the QE2 bridge! Could today fair better?<\/p><p>The boys started from the causeway by the Pier Hotel. The weather was overcast and windy. They set off in Pop Pop's kayak and it soon became apparent that the wind was going to play a major part in proceedings. Along with the high tide there was no problem in moving towards the Gravesend direction, more the fact the wind was pushing them into the middle of the river. The boys had to work hard to keep out of the middle especially as there was an oil tanker being pushed by 2 or 3 tug boats. Fortunately they were a way off that. Pop Pop said that when there are 'white horses' on the tops of the waves then it is at least a force 5, which 30 to 35mph winds in English money.<\/p><p>The waves were hitting the boat which was fun at first, but they were taking on water. Some big waves hit them and the craft became more unstable. The boys were paddling almost solely on one side just to keep them from drifting in to the centre. Suddenly another wave crashed in and the boys had to break from paddling just to concentrate on balancing the vessel. A second wave hit them and they almost rolled.<\/p><p>It was at this point the boys, like politicians, very diplomatically suggested that they should moor up by the bank. They had only been going for 20 minutes or so and had almost reached the peninsula at Greenhithe. They paddled hard to the bank and were suprised to see how much water they had taken on board.<\/p><p>Both agreed that it was too dangerous to continue, it would only be a matter of time before they would have rolled the kayak.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_05_11-01-GreenhitheKayaking.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Picture paints a 1000 words' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Picture paints a 1000 words<\/p><p>Where were they?

Bagels for starters, Cheeseburger and Fries for main and a New York Taxi inspired lemon drizzle with a sponge Empire State building. He was very good in the kitchen for a boy who has not shown a lot of interest in cooking before. He shoved Daddy aside when there were tasks he could do. Bagels is something no one had made before. Wierd that you had to dunk in the bread dough into simmering water for a minute. They went down a storm, if a little big. The cheeseburger was hand made from the mince which was nice, but the boys forgot one of the main components of a burger, the buns! Doh. Never mind, the pudding was an interesting combo of a lemon drizzle cake with a slab of yellow dyed icing shaped and carved into a New York taxi. The thought was there.

He celebrated and shouted winner. It was only 10 minutes later when discussing who gave what marks, that Jessica had given a 6 out of 10, not the nine that Ben had read! Jessica was seeking revenge as she had not forgotten that Ben gave her 1 out of 10 last year! So really Ben came 4th and there was a three way joint winners. However, everyone had accepted Ben as the winner of the prize and got on with it which was nice.<\/p><p>There was a break in the middle of the afternoon. Daddy had treated Farmor et el to a Frenchies, the new Ice Cream Parlour in Camberley, themed like a 1950's American Diner. It was nice that Auntie Susan also came along. Ben had the Blue Moon ice cream, whilst Katie and Jessica had a raspberry and lemon cone with bubblegum balls and marshmellows.

After a month in the house we receive a letter from the SRA to say that Ashworth Law, the firm who dealt with our house transaction, had been stopped from trading due to dishonesty claims. We thought we'd be OK because our sale went through a month previously and surely the contracts would have not been exchanged or completed. WRONG! It would appear that the money obtained from our house and the mortgage was used to buy the new house, no problem, however the solicitors failed to get around to paying off 42 Swordsmans Road. As a result, the new occupiers could not register with the Land Registry as our mortgage was still unpaid. Furthermore, the Stamp Duty of Â£8250 had not been paid off via the Inland Revenue. So not only did the money not get paid, but the contracts were never completed it would appear on the day! What a joke of a conveyancey system this country has. So we have been left with paying off two mortgages, been fined a Â£100 for late Stamp Duty payment and lobbing out Â£175 per hour for a new set of solicitors to complete the sale and purchase of the respective houses we own!<\/p><p>An intervening agent is assigned who acts similar to an administrator.

Of course, Daddy took the cheaper option and decided that we should move all our stuff rather than get removal men in. Over the past 2 or 3 weeks we've been boxing up and trying to find somewhere appropriate to store the boxes. The garage has been filled for weeks. Katie's bedroom was used as a store room after the bed had been dismantled. All in all, the house was looking pretty uninhabitable for the past few days.<\/p><p>In today's crack squad we had Daddy, Mummy, Farfar, Uncle Peter, Pop Pop and Uncle Michael. A few of them were here the night before filling the Luton up with it's first load.<\/p><p>Mr and Mrs Reeve were still packing and clearing up when Daddy knocked on the door at the agreed 9:30 and basically was not allowed back again until 11-ish. The crack squad then decided to have brunch at the Deepcut Cafe. A first.<\/p><p>After a round of fry ups we were allowed to start dumping our gear around the back of the house in the garden. Luckily the weather was dry, but windy and threatening clouds above. At least it wasn't too cold.<\/p><p>After shifting the first load, we went back for a second, this time with some of the larger items. Time was pressing and surprisingly we needed a third load as well.<\/p><p>The troops did fantastically well, there were minimal breakages \/ damage. The funniest bit is when Farfar reversed the Luton into Pop Pop's car. Not much damage done thankfully.<\/p><p>The light was drawing in, the rain started, so there was a bit of a rush to get all the stuff into the house. Most of it was just dumped into the conservatory, awaiting Mummy and Daddy to sort it all out over the next few days and weeks.<\/p><p>One by one people departed. The Fars stayed around for the prize fish and chip dinner, although this time it was an Indian and Chinese takeaway.<\/p><p>Whilst all this fun was happening Ben was at Jaspers, Katie at Nina's and Jessica helping out.

Despite the constant drizzle the day was not too badly effected by the weather. We left early in the morning and arrived at opening time at 10am. First roller-coaster that could be seen was the Sonic Pinball. Like a Waltzer car on a roller coaster. This was really good Katie and Ben were a little scared which was good. Jessica and Mummy went on some of the smaller rides, but Jessica is not satisfied with piddly, little roundabouts any more. No she has to take Daddy on the Enterprise. A super fast, upside down big wheel type ride. She absolutely loved it, where as Daddy was thinking it went too fast, too much upside down and what it was doing to his stomach!!! Again, again. Mummy had the dubious pleasure next turn. Ben went on Submission, his favourite ride as it also went upside down. It was like a flying carpet ride but set at all different angles for the rider. Katie got quite scared on some of the scary, ghost train type rides. She hated Hex, which the rest of us liked. It was certainly different. You are placed in a room. You sit down and you are made to feel that you are spinning around the room. Very good.<\/p><p>We tried to get on the ride called Thirteen, or Th13teen. However, it was shut which was disappointing. We did Blade, the teacup ride, the driving experience, the chair-o-plane, the traditional roundabout, Ice Age 4D, which was different again. A film which had live effects like snow and bubbles raining down, wind and even things smacking the backs of your legs! Towards the end of the day we went on the water rides much to Daddy's protests! First up the log flume which we got very wet on. Next the pirate boat ride which was awesome (especially if it was hot). Each of the pirate boats had about 10 cannons which you could fire water from. People on the side of the ride could fire at them with their own cannons. Anyway Ben got soaked, but he loved it! The final water ride was the tyre ride down the rapids which again we got wet! Daddy had one final go on Rita, which was rapid and made especially better as he sat at the front! A good day had by all, finishing up with Fish and Chips and a night's stay in a Travelodge in Stafford.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_10_12-16-AltonTowers.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Spot the fearless and the scardi-cats' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Spot the fearless and the scardi-cats<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_10_12-23-AltonTowers.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Rapid Ravine' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Rapid Ravine<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_10_12-35-AltonTowers.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Ooo Me Hearties' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Ooo Me Hearties<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Alton Towers"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":4,"m":10,"y":2013},"datev":20131004,"info":{"content":"<p>What a day.

A bit like In-Tech in Winchester, but on steroids. It was really good for the kids as they could design a dinosaur and see it come up on a big screen, chisel for fossils, and take part in loads of interactive, science related things from water pressures, electricity, space, wind tunnel, weights and forces, reaction times and events and even attempting to lie on a bed of nails!!<\/p><p>Fredericksberg was the next stop for some nostalgia swimming. The swimming pool Daddy always went to on holidays. It was still a strict regime which was a little awkward. Anyway we had a great time on the diving boards and slides. The fars came and joined in the fun to.<\/p><p>After an hour and a half in the pool we exited and headed down Marinedalesvej which is where Farmor, Olemor and Olefar used to live. The door to flat entrance was open so we stepped in and had a look. It was in very good shape which was nice to see. After having a go on the local playground we headed towards the Little Garden restaurant.<\/p><p>Well Daddy certainly filled his guts here. He and Farmor shared shared fish, eel, port, beef, bacon and desert. Daddy absolutely loved the meal and felt sick afterwards just on the quantity eaten!

It was nice just to sit and relax for an hour and being carted around the canals and see the sights even if there was a heavy down pour near the end.<\/p><p>We made our way to Magasin for some pastries, watched a street performer juggle some fire lit torches and then on to the Round Tower which we raced down. Ben was captivated by the Lego store and absolutely loved it all. I think he could have stayed in there all day!<\/p><p>We caught the Metro and went out to Bisbjerg to see where Olemor and Olefar were scattered.

It was a disappointing site of drug users congregating and the smell of wee. Just a contrast to the other side of HovedbanegÃ¥rd where all the tourists are. However, we did spot a bakers shop which pleased us. Anyway we caught the 1A and 3A bus past JÃ¸rgen's old hairdressers shop to Valby Park, another location that Daddy hadn't visited before. There was just another unique playground with hills and towers to climb as well as animals carved from wood it seemed. After a long play we walked down to the water's edge and paddled in the water before returning through some interesting gardens back onto the bus and train, home to our hotel.<\/p><p>Then comes the highlight of the holiday for us children; Tivoli. First up is the 100 year old rollercoaster called Rutschebane. Everyone liked this one, and it was Daddy's old favourite. Jessica especially liked it and wanted to go on it again and again. She must have had 10 rides on it in the end.<\/p><p>We went on so many rides, like the Aquila, Ben's first ever upside down ride as he puts it, the Star Flyer, a glorified chair-o-plane ride, which we all found extremely scary as the ride broke down the first time we were on it. It goes very high and there was a fair wind. Daddy doesn't mind admitting he was hanging on in there a bit. Got the heart pumping.<\/p><p>We won a Toblerone on the bike game, had 45 minutes of fun in the fun house. We met up with Fars later in the afternoon, they even had a go in the fun house! We got out of the park for some much needed food at Jensens BÃ¸fhus, before returning again for a belly-testing load of rides. The one unique aspect of Tivoli is the fact it opens to late at night and the appearance of the park changes, there are a lot of pretty lights.<\/p><p>Katie's favourite ride was the Drop Tower, Daddy's was the boating lake, Mummy's the Demon roller-coaster ride which was spectacular at night, Ben's the upside-down ride and Jessica the Rutschebane. We trundled out at half ten and took the 2 minute walk back to the hotel.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_08_11-22-Denmark-Day5-ValbyParkTivoli.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Rock sliding' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Rock sliding<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_08_11-24-Denmark-Day5-ValbyParkTivoli.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Rutschebane with Jessica and Mummy' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Rutschebane with Jessica and Mummy<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_08_11-33-Denmark-Day5-ValbyParkTivoli.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='On top of the Ferris Wheel' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>On top of the Ferris Wheel<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_08_11-42-Denmark-Day5-ValbyParkTivoli.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Aquila' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Aquila<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_08_11-51-Denmark-Day5-ValbyParkTivoli.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Rolling Barrel' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Rolling Barrel<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_08_11-57-Denmark-Day5-ValbyParkTivoli.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Candy Floos Girls' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Candy Floos Girls<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_08_11-62-Denmark-Day5-ValbyParkTivoli.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Tivoli At Night' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Tivoli At Night<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Denmark Holiday: Valby Park - Tivoli"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":10,"m":8,"y":2013},"datev":20130810,"images":5,"info":{"content":"<p>We started by searching for the Parkrun in Amagar Faelled. The park has to be 4 square miles so Daddy was stressing a bit in order to find it in time for the traditional 9am start. We were greeted with others who were also attending and met up with a couple of other English families who were running. We didn't set the world alight, but the course was very nice and we got the same warm, friendly atmosphere as we do in Frimley Lodge.<\/p><p>After the boiling hot run we bussed it over to Copenhagen Zoo. Mummy remembered from her previous trip how good it was and was not disappointed this time either.  One of the first things up was the polar bear enclosure. We could go underground and see them playing under the water. It was quite a site to look up and see a polar bear swimming just above us. A huge, heavy thing like that able to not sink to the bottom. Amazing.<\/p><p>What we liked about the zoo, as Mummy says, there is no rubbish animals, and the fact they all seemed to be fairly active, no lying around, sleeping. We saw lions, elephants being feed, a group of 7 tigers playing, monkeys swinging around and being pickles, giraffes, Mummy's favourite, the Tasmainian Devil, snakes, crocs, brown bear, all sorts. We had a lovely day there.<\/p><p>On the way home we walked into Hamley's and had another go around the toys to play with, and sneaked another McDonalds.

The now legendary Rema 1000. Fantastic value compared to Irma. Top travel tip that. Anyway after our morning routine we headed into town again this time searching for Ãrstedsparken, another park. We finally arrived going the scenic route. We have been so impressed with the parks in Copenhagen. They are all completely different. This one is actually supervised and managed as it has a lot of play equipment such as trikes and scooters. There was even a table football game which was good, as all 5 of us joined in. A small thing like that is just a nice memory of our holiday. We spent almost a couple of hours there before returning to the hotel for a spot of lunch and to pick our swimming gear up. Next stop Islands Brygge.<\/p><p>We of course walked there which took us half an hour. The weather was good and the lido was busy. It had some diving platforms from a carved ship's hull. We loved it, especially Jessica, a real water baby. She lasted longer than any of us. Some of us had a go of the diving platforms. None of us where particularly brave on that front. It was a really good setup. The coldness set in a bit which put us off from staying in too long. After a spot of sunbathing, we got changed and walked south along the water's edge. We stopped off to watch a game of kayak polo. Looks like they were having a lot of fun playing that game, although some foul play was at hand. All in good humour and spirit though. We continued till one of the new bike bridges which we crossed to Fisketorvet.<\/p><p>We caught a train out to Flintholm, then the Metro back into town where we splashed out on a Jensens BÃ¸fhus meal.

We started by walking around Tivoli, Christiansborg Palace, Kongens Nytorv where we decamped into Magasin, which is a huge posh department store and played in the toy department before committing a cardinal sin by visiting McDonalds for lunch. I know, its shocking. The rain had subsided and we continued onto the picturesque Nyhavn where we saw the royal band march through the streets, the Royal Palace (Amalienborg), the Gefion Fountain, the Kastellet Fort and of course the Little Mermaid. A lot of walking so far, and the weather was inclement. We had still plenty more walking to do. Across to two parks. The first was Ãstre AnlÃ¦g where we played loads in the playground. Next was FÃ¦lledparken Park which was very cool; from the tower playground, to the biggest skate park you'll ever likely to see and the traffic playground where a mock road system was been created with real traffic lights and road crossings. We had a great time playing all over this park. We were dead on our feet. We caught the bus back to NÃ¸rreport and stopped in an excellent Pizzaria that Katie especially loved. We packed in a lot of sights and good parks today.

Dad's alarm went off at 3:15am. It took a bit of an effort to rally the troops at first, but everyone fell into order by half past. After gulping breakfast and of course stuffing the last few essentials into the suitcase we embarked in the 4am darkness, needing to quieten the kiddies down before they woke the whole street in their excitement. Tight wad Daddy wasn't prepared to spend $80 on parking at the airport, so devised a scheme which involved looking at street view and the local bus timetables for 5am in the morning! We cruised through Gatwick, changed some money, bought books, and then looked at the departure boards only to notice that our gate had closed! Oh no. The sprint was on. Was the gate a million miles away as it always tends to be? No, fortunately. They were still queueing to board.<\/p><p>This was Jessica's first ever plane journey.

We dumped our bags and walked through the city centre stopping off at the newly opened Hamley's to scout around. There were many activities and a large range of Lego sets to look at which pleased Ben, who is well into it at the moment. We were finally prized away and made our way to the Kings Garden where we played in the sandpits. The weather was gorgeous and there were a lot of students socializing. We popped around Rosenborg Castle before catching a bus for a weary troops to the Opera House at the edge of Christainhavn. The estuary was looking lovely and blue in the sunshine.<\/p><p>We headed back to the hotel room, which was nice and spacious, via Hamley's to spend Ben's birthday money on a Â£80 Lego set which he desperately wanted.

There were a couple of hills to please us all. We made a point at saying 'bonjour' to oncoming riders, and only 2 out of about 15 begrudgingly returned a compliment. They're an unfriendly bunch.<\/p><p>We had some busy 70mph dual carriageways to negotiate where Nick's lights fell off his bike.

We came across a car parked up on the side of the road. She looked like a hooker. Cleaning the inside of her car down. Something very dubious happened there. Still we got a photo just in case we needed to provide evidence!<\/p><p>We stopped off at another top notch patisserie for some lunch. Super high quality. We rolled up the hill to the iconic Arc De Triomphe. I set the challenge to cycle around the 10 lane roundabout. Steve didn't fancy it, he instead got accosted by beggars who had a curious scheme which we still cannot work out. They would drop a ring in front of you making it seem that it was yours. They would then try and give it to you. Then What? Dumbfounded.<\/p><p>After circling the Arc a few times, we headed down the very bumpy, cobble stoned Champs-Elysee. We were making slow progress in the traffic. Still this is what it was all about. Don't know how the Tour De France riders handle it on their road bikes at speed.

The bathroom was the size of the kitchen diner at home, and it had jets squirting stuff from the sides.<\/p><p>The boys were out on the town. First stop was a beer at the end of the road, then a walk to the Sacre Cour, where Steve made friends again with beggars and was called 'strong man' as he tried to get away from the grabbing man. We went in the impressive, grand cathedral. The views were magnificent. Steve was gasping for a beer. After doing a few laps we ended up in a bar opposite the Moulin Rouges for a 20 euro round of alcohol much to my disgust.<\/p><p>Sitting in the sun watching the world go by on the street was very nice. After a frogs legs dinner we hit the metro and waited to see if Steve was going to deliver the promised 'good night out'. He researched by googling 'Where Single Girls Hang Out Paris'. Brilliant. Only the Dawg. We were worried at first as there wasn't too much around, and then we hit Rue Oberkampf. This was very busy. We hit a bar and convinced Steve to climb the stairs that led to the ceiling. Doh!<\/p><p>We then went to '114' which had dancing..... a dancing Steve and I. There was a dj spitting out euro music. Nick was not a dancer and so went off for an explore.... and not seen again by the other two for another3 hours!

Paris at 3am was busier than it was at 3pm strangely enough. There were loads of bars which had massive queues outside. It was 3am.<\/p><p>Meanwhile Nick, who had lost his map, not remembered a phone charger or the name of the hotel was lost! He followed others to the 'centre' where ever that was, but soon lost them. Not sure on the order of these events, but he trod in dog poo, attempted to help a man who was worse for wear, then was sick over Nick's shoes (he had no socks on either). Yuk. He also needed the toilet! Still worse was to come after he eventually found the hotel and began to wash the sick out. After settling down and getting some much needed sleep, Steve decided to hop into Nicks bed and 'spoon' him. Nick, startled, told Steve politely to bugger off. The shock on Steve's face was a picture.

It started slowly as we stocked up on food and cycle repairs. Nick had almost lost his arm in attempting to pump his tyre up.

They know how to do pastry these french dudes.<\/p><p>Despite been told the weather was going to be bad by a scouser at breakfast time, it was overcast and a little cold, but at least there was none of the wet stuff. During the early stages of the 75 mile ride we stuck together and stopped off at some really nice places. The roads were quiet, the scenery filled with fields.<\/p><p>Mid afternoon the shackles were lost and I shot off at a good pace for 5 or 6 miles at first. Then we saw the 20km sign to Marines and again decided to see if I could push the pace on for myself. We all nervously agreed this was the best bit of the trip so far where we rode alone with our mp3 players in. We stopped for a patisserie in Marines. Gorgeous. We had 20 miles to go and Steve was struggling a bit so decided to club together again. We had a few dodgy detours.

There was a slight incline all the way to our destination. We remarked how peaceful and nice the scenery was and how few riders we met. Very country. No cars.<\/p><p>It was interesting to see how we would fair after the long ride yesterday. We certainly weren't the freshest. The ride was getting a bit monotonous in the end. Same path, same scenery. Nick, with 2 miles to go decided to spice it up by getting our second puncture! The spare inner tube did not fit the pump properly so Nick decided to patch up the existing one. We left the Avenue Vert path and headed into the town of Forges Les Eaux.<\/p><p>We found the hotel easily enough. It was the first time we had to put on our best Del Boy french as the receptionist did not (want to) speak English. We were given keys to the garage to lock our bikes.

Daddy was able to keep up, although he was running his own race so didn't use them as pacemakers at all.The first hill hit at 3km and Daddy's slender lead over the Ball's had been quickly irradicated, as expected as he's not clever on the up hill. Still as soon as the downhill came, at about 4 or 5km Daddy re-took the lead. Daddy kept it strong, passing Farfar a couple of times and then saw us lot on the final bend. What Daddy was not expecting was a 'come on Duncan'. Daddy always faded at the end and Duncan was strong. However, Friday night's drinks caught up with him and he was sick all along the path. Great! Daddy pushed hard and finished in a very pleasing time of 47:40.

Jessica went sprinting off and burnt herself out after 500m, which meant her and Mummy stopped. Katie, Daddy and Ben continued until we'd seen the others stopped after the mile mark and that point Katie felt she could go on no longer. That left the Boys to do another 2 miles on there own. The target was to beat last weeks time which they did by about a minute. 32:09 mins was there time which was fantastic. Ben certainly was panting hard around the course.<\/p><p>We headed straight off to Gravesend where Daddy went off with Ma Ma, Pop Pop and Bradley Teale to Gillingham for an adventurous Kayak trip around Hoo Ness. It's been Bradley's ambition for the past 6 years to actually go around the fort so we had good purpose to explore. First potential disaster overerted when the boot of our car slid up which pushed the kayak forward and almost on to the car parked in front. Just so happened Bradley was alert and thus saved a crash!<\/p><p>They set off towards Hoo Ness Island from Gillingham Strand at low tide which was not ideal. Bradley was a little unsure and found the choppy conditions a little unnerving at first. However he settled down and began to enjoy the scenery. There was quite a lot of rubbish which was quite noticeable as they circumnavigated the north side of the island. After half an hour or so, the intrepid sailors looked for a landing spot close to the 150 year old fort. It was difficult as the tide was out which left a lot of mud flats. Finally they found a place, however they were beached 5 metres from dry land. Daddy took his boots and socks off and pulled the vessels in. The intention was for the others not to get wet or muddy. However, once landed they were met with plenty of sinking mud. Daddy foolishly trekked off and didn't get too far before the sinking mud almost ate his boots! In an effort to help pretty much everyone fell over and lost footwear! It was pretty funny really. After a wash down and a struggle they re-boarded their craft and continued past all the scuttle ships which were a great site.<\/p><p>A bay of opportunity presented itself closer to the fort and this time they were able to land and reach ashore without too much bother. They stopped for some much needed Tomato soup which went down well as they were all beginning to feel the chill. Daddy and Bradley went off to see if they could get inside the fort which was defended well with thick foliage. Finally they did find the gangplank which went over the moat. However, it was sunken under water. At the same time they found the opening they could hear Gerry shouting for us quite loudly. What was wrong? Well luckily Carol and Gerry had stayed behind as the tide had quickly turned and came in. Gerry managed to move his Kayak up the beach and Carol was in the water holding Daddy's kayak. Thank goodness for the mother in law!<\/p><p>I think physical and mental strength was waining, that coupled with the weather drawing in meant the travellers were keen to get back to the mainland and get cleaned! The water was quite choppy with waves splashing on to the boats. 25 minutes of paddling ensured the safe return. It was a good adventure even if they didn't get inside Hoo Ness or the intended Darnet fort. Maybe another day.<\/p><p>Meanwhile the girls along with Benny stayed for lunch at the Teales and then went to Shorne Country Park. They went for a long walk to the mausoleum, a bit longer than expected which didn't thrill the kiddies, especially as it was raining. We finally all met up, went home and got a well deserved fish and chips for dinner.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_04_13-06-HooNessKayak.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Tomato Soup Never Tasted So Good' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Tomato Soup Never Tasted So Good<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Parkrun, Hoo Ness Kayak, Shorne Country Park"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":6,"m":4,"y":2013},"datev":20130406,"images":4,"info":{"content":"<p>Continuous promises for the participation in the 5km Parkrun was excused away week after week over the past 2 months. Now Benny Boy has stepped up and decided to take on the 3 mile challenge, a distance he's never even got close to running before. We weren't sure what to expect in terms of performance . Would he last 2 laps? What sort of time would he get? We met up with James and Duncan and we told Ben about the 10 run t-shirt. However, he'd have to complete 2 laps to register for this. This I think spurred him on. Daddy, Ben and James all ran together and it was difficult to gauge as Ben seemed like he could go faster whenever he wanted and didn't sweat at all despite wearing his hoody! Anyway his trainers fell off twice, once near the finish line, he completed the course in 33:06 minutes and came 281 out of 309 runners. We were very proud and made Daddy's day.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_04_06-03-Parkrun.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Ben's First Parkrun' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Ben's First Parkrun<\/p><p>Finally we had some blue skies, sun and no wind. Time for a walk then. We choose the Greenwich walk which starts at the O2, somewhere we've not been before. We parked up in Charlton and caught the bus in. We were impressed and excited at being at the O2. Mummy felt guilty that we've never taken us to see a concert or anything here. One day maybe. We circled the building and even saw people climb some stairs to the top! Wicked. Anyway we got to the Thames and headed west on our slightly weird journey into Greenwich. We walked by heavy plant places, along the Blackwall Tunnel road and along some of the quainter, quieter streets. We stopped for a picnic outside the Cutty Sark pub which was much need by Jessica, before finally hitting the University Buildings. We wet inside our favourite Painted Hall. There are mirrors mounted on top of tea trolleys so you can marvel at the paintings on the ceiling. However, Jessica was marvelling at herself more I think and being silly.<\/p><p>After the chapel we entered the park and played on the swings. There were some more apparatus there now. It was a lovely sunny afternoon. We climbed the hills, and roly pollied down some of them on our way to top and the observatory. There were loads of tourists there. What will it be like in the summer? We wound our way back dow n into town and Daddy had spotted his favourite Pie And Mash shop had reformed and relocated. This made his day. Goddards had ceased to exist in the past few years, the premises taken over by Gourmet Burger (yuk, Judas, errr), but happily they sprung up again on the other side of the shopping bit. We just had to go in and get some pies and a sausage roll. Thank goodness they were as good as ever. We then went in to the big sweet shop and fleeced mummy for some sweets before fighting our way through the market and over to the Cutty Sark. The first time we've seen it since it was restored. It had a strange glass bit around the bottom. When we peered through, there was an underground bit which meant you could effectively walk under the boat.<\/p><p>At the other end of the boat was a street performer singing blues music and playing a harmonica and a steel, electric, slide guitar. This made Daddy's day now three times over. He was compelled to buy the chaps CD, which we all had to endure on the way home. Actually Ben said he liked it! Anyway back to proceedings. We had our race down the foot tunnel. Daddy, Katie and Ben ran down the steps quicker than Mummy and Jessica could go down in the lift. Once up the other side we got the DLR to Royal Victoria Dock. To end our planes, trains and automobiles trek we caught a 'flight' across the Thames in the cable car which took us back to the O2. We loved it, although we were little embarrassed when Ben was saying he should take a bomb into our carriage!

However, it was so muddy the wheels were spinning. In an attempt to get some traction, Daddy went forward and back at an angle. Mud was spraying everywhere. All Daddy could see was Mummy going absolutely beserk and almost having a nervous breakdown. Daddy had manoeuvred the  car into a hollow, some would say shallow ditch and the front bumper was embedded into the grass verge \/ bank. Daddy didn't know this and wondered why the car would no longer go forward. By this stage Mummy I think let the whole car park at Daddy's shortcomings. Daddy was stuck and had even taken off his boots which now sat 5 meters away from the car in an effort to keep everything clean inside.<\/p><p>Stunned, Daddy just sat in the car for about a minute not knowing what to do. A man came across an offered to help get it out. First Daddy had to step out into the mud to get his boots back on, and then address the helpful man. Eventually 6 or 7 blokes came to help, I think in sympathy for Daddy's ear-bashing that he received. After a bit of pushing the car came out easily. However there was a little bit of damage on the under-carriage which cost Â£10 to fix.

Mummy and Daddy were woken at 5:45 at present opening began at 6am! Well Father Christmas didn't deliver exactly what we wanted. Close enough and we were happy enough. For Katie he delivered a Barbie Wardrobe, fashion glasses, makeup set, a Christmas outfit with shoes, Build a Bear clothes, pyjamas, gloves, a Barbie annual, sweets and bubble bath. Ben, a PSP, Build A Bear Clothes, Moshi Monster sticker album, war book, mouthwash, nuts, Lego sticker book, Lego watch and a red hoody.

We then moved down to the presents under the tree which has come from friends. We then went over to the Fars for Christmas Breakfast. We lay on the sofa and watched a film whilst the others opened presents. Mummy had gone to church.<\/p><p>We had the longest journey ever over to Gravesend. Two accidents, meant two long traffic jams, the last of which was right by the last junction, the Gravesend turn off on the A2. We were so close, Mummy, Katie and Ben decided they would get out and walk to Ma Ma's! They made the 0.75 mile trek along the stationary A2, past the police, down the sliproad and on to Wrotham Road. By this time Daddy and Jessica were moving again and were able to pick us up. At least we were able to stretch our legs and see the scenic A2 by foot.<\/p><p>The Elders arrived a few minutes before us and so the bedlem began. The children had their Christmas lunch which was over in a flash. Not many deserved the 'Finish Me' medal! We then went for a walk down to the rec then it was present opening time. There was great enthusiasm to be Father Christmas and distribute the presents from the tree. Each child had their pile and began opening. Wow what a lot of presents.<\/p><p>After a bit of play time and dinner it was soon bed time for us all, leaving the adults to tackle their monster sized Christmas Dinner and for them to open their presents.

Everyone was excited. If I had to rank the whole Christmas spirit and excitingness it would definitely have to be Katie first who has been very sweet and busy making and obtaining presents for everyone. She made Mummy and Daddy some quizzes, pictures, stories, all sorts. Uncle Graham got a Rangers tea mat which were made from Hana Beads, Farfar got a diary. She seemed to get as much pleasure from giving as receiving the gifts. Katie showed the most amount of Christmas spirit possible. Ben was hoping for a Bat Cave. Jessica was mad as ever and I think was looking forward to the sweets and chocolate.<\/p><p>Just after lunch we headed over to the Kelley's for some pre-Christmas drinks which was nice. There were plenty of children to play with. James and Ben got on like a house on fire, and Amy Huggets was there so Jessica was happy and exuberant as ever.<\/p><p>We left mid afternoon and entered the Danish Christmas zone. By this stage we were tracking where Father Christmas was in the world, Afghanistan. The children were cranked to the max in excitement, but first we had the Christmas meal. The roast pork was excellent, which Daddy and Jessica ventured into. It seemed Daddy hadn't eaten for a week! Mummy, Katie and Ben had sausages instead. It was nice that the children were more grown up and could fend for themselves a bit more.<\/p><p>Daddy won the Risalamande challenge and got a Chocolate Orange for his troubles. Finally after a game of Coppit we were allowed to light the candles on the tree and start opening presents. Not quite like how the Fars like it, Katie and Ben were dealing all the presents out quickly and lots were being opened. Farfar got the family book which Daddy had spent many, many hours on. Farmor got lots of 'heart' related presents.<\/p><p>We spent 45 minutes opening presents and ended with a nice cup of coffee and Katie and Ben had produced a lovely 12 page programme of a carol concert and readings. It was so lovely for us all to join them in singing some Christmas carols.

Each trip lasting 10 or 15 minutes.<\/p><p>There were some nice gardens there, which is not our cup of tea generally, but it was a pictureque landscape. One of the best bits of the place was the exhibition centre where there were shops set in the 40's and the Dad's Army museum.<\/p><p>After leaving we spent a bit of a wild goose chase looking for the Horse Sanctuary which looked really good.... if it was open. Instead we shifted down to Thetford Forest and went to it's excellent park.<\/p><p>We almost didn't go in as it was quite expensive for parking. However, when we did go in it was packed and the charges were justified as there was excellent play equipment for the kids hidden in the forest. One section had loads of musical apparatus. It was on a par with Bewilderwood but Â£60 cheaper! We spent two hours playing there. It had play equipment that we've not seen before. I think we've become experts in this now.

Another Â£60 or so pounds worth of entrance fees. It's expensive stuff kids and going out eh?<\/p><p>We wandered about looking at the animals. The best bits were the talks and shows we went to. The birds of prey talks and demos were fantastic, made twice as good by the presenters. We saw the Harris Hawk and Falcon, Eagle, and even 7 vulchers. They were agressive. The presenter said we should be sympathic with the animals and that they unfairly get a bad press. We all eat dead meat.<\/p><p>We then saw another animal show and both Mummy and Daddy now love the armadillo. The ran across the stage a couple of times. He had diddy legs and he was suprisingly fast. We saw the tiger very close up, monkies, giraffes, the usual zoo fair.<\/p><p>We made it to our hotel in the evening, then went out to Needham Market and ate fish and chips by the lake and playground. Very nice sunset before returning back and another epic game of Binweevil Top Trumps.

It's basically a suped-up playground with slides, 3 man swings, zip wires, climbing frames that scale up in to the trees. We started with a little boat ride through the marsh to reach the main bits. The kiddies loved the slides the most. They were made from plastic, with low friction, which meant high speeds. You could see they were a little scared going down on the first few gos. Again Jessica was well in there going on with the big boys.<\/p><p>We had lots of competitions going on the apparatus, mainly time trials. Of course Ben fell off a few times which caused a some tears. He also got grumpy with himself when he didn't win. He gets quite compeititve ensuring fair play. Later in the afternoon there was an area in the woods where you could build your own den out of sticks that were scattered around. A challenge for Daddy and us kiddies. Mummy had a little sleep. So king bodge and his collection of sticks. A camp was made but you had to be careful that you didn't sneeze too close. It was strudy enough for us to play in at least for a bit. We got our photos and then trashed it before others did, as those scavengers wanted our sticks.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_08_24-62-EasternHoliday-Day5-Bewilderwood.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Slipery Slope' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Slipery Slope<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_08_24-84-EasternHoliday-Day5-Bewilderwood.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Our Den' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Our Den<\/p><p>We finished up late afternoon and returned to our base in Norwich before walking into the city centre to get some food. The trouble is that we have been eating out every evening and it normally involved chips and grease. So we all agreed on an Italian. Daddy refused Pizza Hut, snob! Well yes, the experience from 4 days ago has put him off with screaming kids, dirty toilets and worries of quality and hygine. Other than that it's fine. Instead we went to an Italian Restaurant at the top of town. At first we were the only customers which was nice as we didn't have to worry about the awful table manners of the children.<\/p><p>Daddy, Ben and Katie were thinking about going to the evening Banger Car Racing in Swaffham, however they ran out of time.

Thinking about it, we've done quite a few theme parks in our time. Of course all the popular ones around our way, but quite a few out of the area. Some of the not so well known ones. This is one of those. There was a smattering of rollercoasters and other fairground type rides. There was plenty to fill a day and even better Jessica could join in quite a bithaving reached over 1 metre in height. In fact Katie is 1.32m, Ben is 1.22m and Jessica 1.03m.<\/p><p>Jessica's favourite ride was the traditional Pirate Ship where she kept her hands off the rails when it was at its highest! She along with mummy also enjoyed the Grass In The Snake rollercoaster. We also loved the 'Flying Like Superman Ride' which is one we not seen before. Your caged in lying down on your tummy and then the ride spins around, going up and down. The other favourite was the dinghy down a massive slide ride.<\/p><p>The most stand out features of today however were the sideshows. The one in the morning was the seal show with all the normal tricks like balancing and juggling balls, splashing the kids and all that. It was presented in a very good way. The show in the afternoon was performed in a theatre and was absolutely excellent. Sean Alexander has performed on Britain's Got Talent, he was an illustionist and performed these fantastic tricks. We were left thinking, 'how did he do that?'. It was very professional, I can see him making the Tele one day.<\/p><p>Overall you can never go wrong with a theme park we all had a good day. We stopped off in Oulton Broad for some din dins, then ventured into Norwich City Centre for our night's stay.

We were on the Dedham Vale walk which takes in Constable's country, the scene of the Haymaker. Mummy is losing confidence on our excellent walks book. With the phone now we can track the length of the walk and compare it to what it says. We always seem to walk further by about 20%.<\/p><p>We started in the picturesque setting with cottages and ponds and countryside. We soon made off along the path into the wilderness. We entered fields of sheep and cows on our figure of eight walk. We followed the River Stour to Dedham where we stopped to marvel at the church and marvel even more at the sweets we were allowed to buy.<\/p><p>Along the whole journey Katie and Ben were 'Just pretending...'. It was so lovely to see not only them getting on so well which took their minds off the unpopular walk, but they were being quite imaginitive in making a story which they were part of. Of course it followed along the lines of Star Wars - Power Rangers. They were leaders who could teach their young on how to fight. The 'gem' would make them able to teach better, whilst the 'power' would give them extra fighting skills. They debated whether the 'Boss' was the leader of everything or just the boss of the elite fighters! There was a lot of discussion over hierarchy.<\/p><p>We were a mile over the quoted 4 mile walk confirming mummy's suspicions. We came back to a full car park and scooted off north to leg 2 of the holiday, Norfolk. Burgh Castle was over an hour away. The weather was still pretty good, warm and sunny. The castle or fort dates back to Roman times and looked pretty impressive in terms of it's size. 4 metre walls going on for 100 metres or so. We played some more games whilst mummy and daddy were admiring the views.<\/p><p>We dumped our stuff at the hotel and then went out into Great Yarmouth for the evening. We ate at a restaurant called Fatso's. It was like heaven for the kiddies. Chips and ice cream!<\/p><p>We felt quite uneasy then walking to the beach, plenty of druggy looking people all very hectics and shouting and poor looking people. Anyway it was dusk at the beach where we mucked around a bit, played in the arcades and watched the Heart Radio traveling show. A band was on singing covers. Quite a few there. We didn't stay for the fireworks instead returning to the hotel for the nights sleep. We had brought our inflatable matress to fit us all into the room. Children getting too big to share a bed now. So although we'd officially only booked in two children we had to sneak the third in.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_08_22-09-EasternHoliday-Day3-DedhamBurghCastle.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Where Constable painted something famous' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Where Constable painted something famous<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_08_22-29-EasternHoliday-Day3-DedhamBurghCastle.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Up in the hills' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Up in the hills<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_08_22-64-EasternHoliday-Day3-DedhamBurghCastle.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Burgh Castle' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Burgh Castle<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_08_22-90-EasternHoliday-Day3-DedhamBurghCastle.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Hammer Time in Great Yarmouth' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Hammer Time in Great Yarmouth<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Eastern Holiday: Walk 37: Dedham Vale, Burgh Castle, Great Yarmouth"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":21,"m":8,"y":2012},"datev":20120821,"images":3,"info":{"content":"<p>Having missed Clacton last night, we decided to wander down to the pier in the morning to expirience the delights of Clacton pre 9am! Well needless to say nothing had started up but we did manage to get on to the pier which was filled with fairground attractions. It was pretty big. Anyway we went to the top and back and we also went out on one of the groyns which led out to sea. Jessica of course slipped over on the seawwed and needed rescuing! There was a boy who was doing back flips onto the sandy beach. Very impressive.<\/p><p>Daddy was adament in going up to Walton on the Naze for two boring reasons. 1) Jamie at work went there for all his childhood holidays and 2) It's one of the locations mentioned on the shipping forecast. Curiousity got the better of Daddy and had to see what the place was like. Well Walton had a big pier and a very nice sandy beach. Somewhere to come back to when we have more time. We had to get to Mersea which wasn't far as the crow flies, but we had to go back into Colchester in order to get back out to Mersea.<\/p><p>We headed to the less popular East Mersea and Cudmore Grove Country Park. Here we explored around the coast to see the World War II costal defences. We played in the clay and got very black legs and in the pill boxes.<\/p><p>A change of scenery back into Colchester to the fun-filled Rollerworld. We all had skates and circled around the purpose build rollerskating rink. All the children improved as the session progressed. Jessica at first seemed she was on 3 bottles of vodka a day and almost mastered balancing by herself at the end. Ben was able to get around without falling over and Katie was quickest out of us all, including the adults. We had time trials as well as challenges set by the dj. We managed to make a train of 4 which was the highest out of everybody. Medals please.<\/p><p>We then went to find Highwood Country Park and had time trials on the assault course that was there. We could race against each other.

This year we wanted a break from going west and decided to go erm... east. The popular jet-setters destination of Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk! We trooped onto the M25, got stuck in a traffic jam at Dartford Tunnel. Went below where Daddy capsized a month before and arrived at Benfleet. Of course our parents were not prepared to pay for parking and after a lot of searching Daddy eventually dumped the car in a leisure centre in Canvey Island! Interesting. So we had 6 more walks to complete from the original book. All of which are in hard to get to locations.<\/p><p>We began at Benfleet station at about midday, when the sun was at it's highest and seemingly hottest. All but Mummy had removed their tops as we headed east towards Leigh On Sea. Mummy found it difficult to follow the map and a couple of times got a bit stressed as we went along the wrong route.<\/p><p>Daddy enjoyed this route as we followed a railway line and the contribrituary to the Thames and the English Channel. We were at the spot of where the Thames ends and the sea starts. We passed through farmers fields of corn, cows and ponds. On top of the hill was the location of the Mountain Biking in the Olympics. We could see the fencing around the perimeter but not alot else. We climbed a big hill and found the ruins of Hadleigh Castle. The views were fantastic over the Thames estuary and the weather gorgeous. Us kiddies decided to climb the ruins which made flutters in Daddy and Mummy's hearts as they weren't designed for adventurers.<\/p><p>After a short stop up here we descended to Leigh On Sea for a much needed cold, icey drink and explore of the local fish stalls and shops.<\/p><p>There was a real small beach and luckily we brought our swim stuff so went out for a paddle and swim. The tide was in so there wasn't too much beach. Daddy was stressing over getting sand over and into everything. Yeah Dad whatever! We found a concrete causeway underwater which allowed us to walk further out into sea. The current was quite strong so it was important we kept our feet and stayed on the concrete. There was another young girl of about 6 years old about 10 metres away doing the same thing. However, the current swept her off the ledge of the concrete gang way. She started to struggle to keep afloat and began to scream for help. She was panicing to stay above water. Daddy was close by and was able to grab her and keep her afloat. The current was still strong and goodness knows what would have happened to her. Daddy picked her out and carried her over to an understandably anxious mum who was watching her every move, but didn't realize that there was a concrete path effectively keeping us all a foot or two higher than the seabed. It shocked Katie quite a bit. She commented she didn't like the sea anymore. After a bit she returned to the water as did the other girl after she had calmed down.<\/p><p>We got changed and walked back to the railway station and caught a train back to Benfleet where Daddy went along way to retrieve the car. We then meandered our way north to reach our night's stop in Clacton On Sea via Pizza Hut. It was a very warm night and Daddy snuck out to watch the second  half of the Manchester United's opening game of the season against Everton. We lost 1-0!<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_08_20-08-EasternHoliday-Day1-Hadleigh.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Hadleigh Castle in the background' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Hadleigh Castle in the background<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Eastern Holiday: Daddy Saves Little Girls Life, Walk 35: Hadleigh Castle"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":19,"m":8,"y":2012},"datev":20120819,"images":2,"info":{"content":"<p>We had a two hour trip into the Cotswolds where Mummy's childhood friend was getting married in a Humanists wedding. It was a beautiful setting on a farm in the middle of the countryside, 5 miles outside Tetbury. Elizabeth had moved to New York over 10 years ago so her life was very much based over there which was reflected in Joel's nationality and many of the congregations. It was a scorching day, too hot for suits, but the weather did allow us to have the marriage be performed outside on the lawns. When I say a farm, it was very much geared to large gatherings with a very plush interior and facilities for food and drink. Not a cow shed where we had to slaughter our own food and milk a cow for fluids!<\/p><p>It was interesting speaking to some of the American guests they were all very friendly and it was good to see they were mixing in well with the natives. The ceremony itself was conducted by a lady who told us things about the couple, how they met and their feelings for one another. Almost how a marriage should be without all the stuffy religious garnish! No hymms as well.<\/p><p>The wedding breakfast was lovely and we didn't have to pay for a drink all evening. The happy couple had chosen to have a wedding cheese cake which was very cool for the likes of daddy and served as the source of food later in the evening.<\/p><p>Katie, Ben, Jessica, Joey and Lily had teamed up with a couple of other similarly aged children and practiced for about an hour on putting on a performance. We were not too sure what was in the production. After some disputes and change in direction, I don't the children knew quite exactly what was going to be included. However, the children were very eager to get as many people down to show off their efforts. There was a mixture of rolly-polies, headstands and the curious, allbeit popular, discus throwing. There were plenty of us to shout and cheer the children on and they were lapping up the applause at the end.<\/p><p>Although Ben wanted to dance 'all night long', as we participated in the disco dancing time was marching on and we had to leave as early as possible tomorrow for a trip east. We arrived at home at 1am in the morning. Thanks and congratulations to the happy couple.

We played piggy in the middle with Daddy and Steven and the sticky bat and ball game with mummy. Daddy and Ben also made up a game of golf. Instead of hitting a golf ball with a club, we kicked a ball with our feet. We had obstacles to go through then a tree to hit. It was good fun.<\/p><p>Daddy unfortunately had to go to work up in London to help support the security system the British Transport Police were using for the Olympics.

We took a bus trip to Bank on which we saw loads of the London landmarks. We wondered to get some lunch and then onto the DLR to Mansion House and the Excel centre. We had tickets for the 1pm showing of the 55kg and 75kg heats, well all the rounds upto and including the semi finals. We sat in the holding area for a bit to eat our lunch, watch the camera crew go around and soak in some of the atmosphere. There were quite a few foreigners in today, mainly from the nation who are competing which comprise mainly of the countries to the south of Russia as well as the North American contingent.<\/p><p>Once the wrestlers came out the action was fast paced, especially as there were three bouts being fought simultaneously. For each fight closest to us we each picked the person who we wanted to win. Each bout lasted about 15 minutes. The North Arena 2 was close to it's 10,000 capacity although we managed to sneak forward to get better seat half way through the sitting. I think it just about held Ben's interest although he was very fidgety. We were always routing for the Western countries. He was getting well into it. After about 3 hours the session ended and we were ready to go home. On the way home we say this funny man from Thailand who was clothed in national dress and had a mask which surrounded his head that made he appear to have 4 faces.

Almost more importantly the Aquatics Centre was located inside the Olympics Park. So again Daddy had another half day and raced up to London to meet up with Steve. They headed straight to Stratford and expereinced the Park! Again loads and loads of people milling around. And again the staff and helpers on the park were very welcoming, asking how you were, getting you to sing, do high fives, etc. There were another set who were the Coco Cola entertainers who did all the above but in an organised way. Daddy and Steve walked around the whole park as they had 4.5 hours to kill before their event began. They took in the Coco Cola Beat Box which is a little hard to describe its purpose. Essentially you put your hand on or near various surfaces and music would play or change in pitch. They swirled around the outside of the building. It didn't quite work. Anyway once they reached the top they got a nice picture with the Olympic Torch. Inside the tower was loads of mirrors and then some lanterns which changed colours and opened and shut. I know I am not making much sense here, it is a little hard to describe. Once they descended back to the bottom of the building on the inside you got your free coke and some of the entertainers dancing.<\/p><p>Back into the blistering heat of the Olympic park. They finally reached the opposite end where the Hockey stadium was and rested watching the big screens in the park. They saw Nicola Adams get her gold medal. They took in some sustenance in the form of fish and chips before hot stepping it over to the Aquatics Centre. The tickets were Â£50 each and for that you got a seat at the top of the stadium. They were higher than the main roof! Still they had a good unobstructed view. There were 12 girls each having 5 dives. The chinese lady won it by loads. The two boys were sort of able to predict the scores, mainly based on the amount of splash made. The session lasted a couple of hours, getting out just in time to see the 200m final. They watched it in the Panasonic 3d Home Cinema centre, which for daddy didn't give anymore experience than a normal tv. Anyway they saw Usain Bolt cruise home for another gold medal. The chaps still eager for more headed to the park with the big screens again, sat back and enjoyed a beer and the atmosphere as the sun set. Almost romantic eh? It was chucking out time at the stadium and both made it home at gone 1am in the morning! Thanks Steve for the ticket and a great day out.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_08_09-21-OlympicParkDiving.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The Orbit' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The Orbit<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_08_09-26-OlympicParkDiving.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The Park overlooking the Riverbank (Hockey Stadium)' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The Park overlooking the Riverbank (Hockey Stadium)<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_08_09-45-OlympicParkDiving.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Stadium at night' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Stadium at night<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_08_09-53-OlympicParkDiving.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Inside the Coco Cola Beat Box' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Inside the Coco Cola Beat Box<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_08_09-71-OlympicParkDiving.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Giving The Dawg A Walk In The Park' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Giving The Dawg A Walk In The Park<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_08_09-88-OlympicParkDiving.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Me and Steve In Front Of The Rings and the Aquatics Center' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Me and Steve In Front Of The Rings and the Aquatics Center<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_08_09-131-OlympicParkDiving.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Got the moves like Jagger' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Got the moves like Jagger<\/p><locations><location>1120<\/location><location>2401<\/location><\/locations>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Olympics: Olympic Park and Womens Diving Final"},"version":5},{"date":{"d":7,"m":8,"y":2012},"datev":20120807,"first":{"value":null},"images":2,"info":{"content":"<p>Kind old Uncle Richard Sanders had a spare ticket for the Men's Football semi final at Wembley and decided to invite Daddy along.

A capcity crowd of 83,000 shared the experience. The seats were high up reasonably close to the Royal Box. The match itself was akin to a training session. A lot of keep-ball with a smattering of tackles. Some of the goals were good. Japan sat back and folded as soon as they went 1-0 up. They tried to sit on the lead and as soon as Mexico scored Japan could not find the quality to strike back. Mexico ran out a deservid 3-1 winners and face the strong Brazil in the Final.

Still the atmosphere generated by the near capacity 15,000 spectators was good. There was a warm up person who asked quiz questions, filled us in with the laws of the game, etc. Some pumping music and we were all up for some volleyball action.<\/p><p>It was a very tight, evenly fought contest. Not more than 5 points from each other through out the evening. Daddy got some pictures of course.... about 200 of them!! It was good to get into the game and study the tactics. The main one being, get it to a lady who would try and smash it from the edge of the court near the net. There were alot of high fives and hugging and shouts of encouragement. The game went to the deciding set where Brazil just edged it and won the match after a good couple of hours.<\/p><p>Daddy was surprised to see that there was another match on the card. He tried various points at getting a better seat. Eventually one of the inspectors turned their back for 10 seconds allowing Daddy to get a good vantage point at the other end of the stadium for the Russia vs Japan game.

He'd rang the London Port Authority to check and report his plans and monitored when high tide was due and whether it was going to be too windy. It was close to 11am when we pushed Daddy off at the Woolwich Ferry terminal. He'd just received a smart phone from Auntie Susan which meant he could now track where he was and record his progress. Woo Hoo.<\/p><p>The weather was appalling but Daddy didn't mind too much in his new rain jacket and had everything else in waterproof bags. Progress was leisurely to begin with with the odd boat passing by. The water was quite choppy, especially when the container ships passed. The wash was bouncing off the stationary barges which made for a bumpy ride.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_07_14-06-KayakWoolwich.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Setting off from Woolwich' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Setting off from Woolwich<\/p><p>Daddy stayed mostly to the south side of the river which was a bit of luck as he quickly found that the back end of the boat was sinking which meant he had to get to shore quickly before he rolled the Kayak over. The nose of the kayak was riding quite high making balance difficult especially with the choppy conditions. However, the nearest bank was infact mud or silt at Thamemede just by the Crossness Sewage Treatment Works! Daddy managed to land the boat on the mud and got out, knee deep in mud, which as a side note was strangely warm and quite a nice feeling.<\/p><p>Having got out of the boat Daddy tried to empty the boat of water and lifted the pillow which weighed a tonne. Naughtily Daddy had to dump the pillow as he thought that was the reason for the sinking. By this point there were 6 or 7 people watching me struggle around in the mud. The water and pillow was out. A frantic amount of paddling was required to be set free from the bank. However, no change, the nose pointed right up and again Daddy almost rolled the boat. So a hasty return to the bank was made. One of the kids watching asked if I was OK and suggested to move the seat to the middle of the vessel. Good idea!<\/p><p>It took a while to unstrap everything as again Daddy sank into the mud up to his knees. Seat finally moved to the middle, rain still lashing down. Another ungainly entry to the boat which seemed real uncomfortable without the pillow and Daddy was off again successfully. This time balance was returned.<\/p><p>Daddy powered on but had strayed into the middle of the river. Soon the London Port Authority boat had spotted this and rounded on Daddy and basically told him to move to paddling near to the bank. It took quite an effort to get over that far and the manouvre was made under the watchfull eye of the LPA boat!<\/p><p>Soon the Dartford Crossing was upon Daddy. He decided to report into HQ, i.e. Mummy. Coasting on the south side of the river, whilst putting the phone back in the bag, Daddy took the oppotunity to keep his sugar levels up by taking a few Fruit Pastills. He was slowly being sucked into the wooden structs of a pier but didn't make too much effort on attempting to get away, thinking he'll just bounce off it.<\/p><p>Then as quick as anything the Kayak flipped over on its side turning the contents of the boat into the Thames. A wally, two bags and the paddle. Fortunately Daddy raised to the surface quickly and grabbed the kayak, bag and paddle. He saw the bag with phones and wallet and went under water to grab them. However he missed and that was the last we saw of that. Daddy was annoyed and took a few seconds to compose himself as the current was taking him towards the bridge where there would be increased danger with the swells of water. How easy was it going to be to attempt to flip the kayak over and get back in with all the equipment? A meak failed first attempt let Daddy know that it was at least possible. Unknown to Daddy the Kayak was filling with water. More of that in a moment.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_07_14-08-QE2Bridge.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Where the incident happened' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Where the incident happened<\/p><p>A successful roll of the Kayak meant Daddy could clamber back in and set himself to pass under the bridge safely. His goal of getting to Gravesend was now over even though he strangely felt stronger than ever. However, with the weather and having being soaked he knew it was important to quickly get back to shore. The London Port Authority boat mentioned there was a causeway at Greenhithe to get out. This was a 15 minute paddle from the incident.<\/p><p>Land at last. The weather was worse than ever, but it didn't mean too much as Daddy was soaked anyway. He tried to pull the Kayak out of the water as he would normally, but found it difficult. He thought he must have sapped alot of energy up with the previous 10 miles of adventure! After a short rest he tried again and found it pretty difficult to move. He managed to get it clear of water. The tide was lowering so was not too worried about it being swept away whilst he went to look for help.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_07_14-07-Greenhithe.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Greenhithe Pier' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Greenhithe Pier<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_07_14-09-Route.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The Route' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The Route<\/p><p>No phone, no money and not many people about in the rain. Daddy wasn't really sure where he was. Fortunately there was a near by pub which Daddy tentatively went into dripping wet. He asked if he could borrow someones phone. He rang his Mum who was able to relay an SOS message to Mummy, who had only just got to Auntie Karens. The people in the pub even got Daddy a coffee.<\/p><p>Laura arrived within half an hour or so. When returning to the Kayak we found the reason for the earlier problems of the nose rising out of the water and the problems of dragging it out of the water. The plug at the back of the boat had fallen out which meant the kayak was steadily filling up with water. Just think of a container floating in the bath. Now fill that container with water, see what happens.<\/p><p>Daddy got a telling off from Mummy and a bigger telling off from his Dad.<\/p><\/woops><p>In the evening we joined up with Ma Ma, Pop Pop and the Elders at Mummy's cousin, Hannahs, wedding.

After a playground stop we entered Hampstead Heath where Katie and Mummy decided to go swimming in one of the ponds.<\/p><p>It was a really nice atmosphere. The pay machine failed to work so the lifegaurd let us in for nothing. It was real back to nature stuff. Open air changing rooms and an unheated pond! Katie braved it first and got in. When mummy got in she said it was so cold it took her breath away. The lifegaurd kept a close watch over Katie as it was quite deep. They played and swum around for about 20 minutes before coming back out into the rain.<\/p><p>The walk meandered through the heath, stopping off to play on trees, some upright some not! With all the hills and stops and extensions, time was marching on and spirits were flagging with some of the troops, not helped when we were directed a mile in the wrong direction!<\/p><p>We finally returned to Hampstead village where there was a large street market, mini fair rides and a band playing.

There were some in fancy dress, some even had music blaring out of their bike somehow.<\/p><p>Daddy was on his own, battling up the hills overtaking alot of people on far better bikes than his.

It was a race for the final 34 miles!! Daddy did well up the hills, where as Ryan made up the time on the flat and downhill sections. It was nipp and tuck all the way.<\/p><p>They then came to the mighty Ditchling Beacon, where they were told you'd be lucky to only get half way up before having to walk. Apparently only 7% of riders make it! Prior to this point Ryan must have been leading by 5 or 10 minutes. However, he had got off and started to walk the hill. To Daddy's surprise he saw Ryan ahead of him, not having seen him for the previous 7 or 8 miles.<\/p><p>Daddy made it and didn't stop for a rest at the top for fear that Ryan would take him again. The final 6 miles were all down hill or flat and quite bitty as there were quite a few traffic light stops.<\/p><p>Daddy swung around the roundabout by the pier and went down the home stretch where there were loads of people cheering.

It was quite a windy and chilly day. This did not deter us children to go in the pond for a paddle. Even Dilzo joined in the fun. We had a great time although it was cold when we got out.

Later we popped over to Cross Farm school where we were running two stalls the Lucky Dip and XXXX. Farmor won a day for two at a trendy spa place. Very nice.<\/p><p>Later in the afternoon Farmor took us to Pirbright to see the circus. We loved it.

A tasty egg bap on the gas stove setup us nicely. Now the daring or stupid was about to happen. The 'lazy' rower along with the 'food snatcher', the 'two times dipper' and the 'titanic paddler' were boarding the most unstable vessel. Daddy was circling around like a shark waiting for it's prey to fall into the water. Michael with his weight issues sitting in the middle coupled with a nervous doggy made the canoe even more unstable. An abort request was made early on and Daddy in true 'Top Gear' type tradition laughed very hard at the panic and the remakable navigational skills of the oarsman in their desperation to find Michael and Dilly dry land. Eventually it happened half a mile down the river leaving a long walk back. Despite the idea of taking it easy, their were some serious efforts made to push the convoy along. Again Rachel and Michael were dotted along the route giving a cheery wave.<\/p><p>Some made the first stop, other 'canoers' didn't. It was so funny to hear the blame and counter-blame of why the boat went in the wrong direction. Thanks to Howard and Susan who kept Daddy most amused. We did eventually stop for lunch at Lower Lydbrook and a much earned rest. Daddy and Auntie Ellie who paired in a boat wondered why Charlotte and Pop Pop were quicker, so we swapped partners and we don't like to say what the results were. Needless to say Auntie Charlotte was in the stronger boat on noth occassions.<\/p><p>Come mid afternoon we finally reached Symonds Yat. Exit points from the river were few and far between, all charging to exit on their land! One canoe hire company was very reluctant to provide information on where we could drag the boats out. Very unfriendly. We finally made it out of the water, 42 miles since Hereford. A big well done and thank you to all who took part.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_05_17-19-RossOnWye.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='13 miles to Symonds Yat' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>13 miles to Symonds Yat<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Day 3 - Kayaking Weekend"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":12,"m":5,"y":2012},"datev":20120512,"images":4,"info":{"content":"<p>Daddy awoke early to the sound of bird song and funny sounds emanating from the Weston tent!!! It was quite frosty as well which poses quite an issue in a compact tent. Anyway it was lovely to peer out of the tent to see swans elegantly landing in the River Wye next to us. We ferried the vessels and campers up to Hereford boat yard and met the Fars and the Elders.<\/p><p>Away we go. 28 miles to Ross On Wye. The river was flowing at a good pace but not enough we thought for the hire companies to cancel their bookings. The sun was blazing and weather just about perfect. Down the river we saw a mink which was very exciting. Midway through the first leg a number of parties stop off at a campsite for a coffee, leaving the other two boats to carry on. Shocking teamwork.<\/p><p>Daddy swapped to the Canadian Canoe for a bit which was interesting using a single paddle and kneeling down. We spotted Rachel and Michael who dotted themselves along our route. The Fars caught a glimpse of us from high up in the hills.<\/p><p>16 miles in and our first accident. Not realizing how close we were to our lunchtime meeting point, Ellie and Susan wanted top stop for a rest. Howard and Daddy attempted to assist in landing on the river bank. The boys rested against a pole in a fast flowing part of the river. The ladies then bumped into the boys canoe, capsizing them and spilling the contents into the river. The girls of course remained dry and Ellie had the audacity to video the aftermath rather than help get the boys and bags out of the river! Daddy's phone and diabetes gear was in the bag which was rescued under the water. Pheeww. We lost Susan's jumper however.<\/p><p>The 'coffee crew' caught up and we set sail once again for about half a mile to Hoarwithy campsite, our lunchtime destination. Landing here didn't go without incident either and poor old Howard went in the drink again. His partner, the honourable Susan Tilbury stood up in the boat, lost balance and made the Canadian canoe capsize for a second time in half an hour. Oh how we laughed. Howard wasn't too impressed at first, but quickly saw the funny side.<\/p><p>We ate our lunch..... Dilly eating other peoples lunches and prepared for our second stint. Personnel changes meant the laziest rower in the world, Mr Michael Elder, partnered Howard in the Canadian canoe. Ellie was with her Dad, Jon with brother Gerry and Daddy with 'Billy No Mates'. Boys will be boys and much of Daddy's trek involved playing silly buggers with Uncle Michael and Howard. This leg was quite hard but it was very tranquil and nice just to stop and suck in the fresh air.<\/p><p>At about 6pm we finally landed just past Ross On Wye by a pub in Wilton. The patch of grass between the pub and the river was our camp site. It was a glorious sunny evening. The stuck the tents up, went to the pub and have a lovely meal and a couple of sherberts. We hadn't realized how much sun we had all caught during the day. Most kayakers had a touch of sunburn. There were many tired bodies with the 28 mile trek from Hereford.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_05_17-17-RossOnWye.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Morning route' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Morning route<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_05_17-07-RossOnWye.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='In the boat with Howard' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>In the boat with Howard<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_05_17-18-RossOnWye.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Afternoon route' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Afternoon route<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_05_17-05-RossOnWye.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Our campsite.

After dumping our kit we had to go and collect the Canadian canoe 10 miles away at Symonds Yat.<\/p><p>When we arrived we were presented with a slight problem as we were told the river was flowing too fast and were told to reconsider our plans. Apparently the resovoir upstream was full and the Environment Agency had opened a dam and released loads of water. Some canoe hire companies had cancelled all weekend bookings. You could see that the water level was a meter or so higher than usual. So we decided tomorrow we'd start from Hereford.<\/p><p>Other arrivals at the campsite were Pop Pop, Jon's brother Gerry, Charlotte, Howard and Susan.

For the uninitiated Airsoft is like paintball on steroids. Ball bearings are the bullets, but there is also grenades of various sorts (stun, smoke, frag), tracer or glow in the dark ball bearings, competitors with 3rd generation night vision which cost into the thousands of pounds. There are various weapons from pistols, sniper rifles and the million variants of machine gun. There were lots of other 'pyros' which were exploded to signify air strikes and mortar fire all of which were very loud, especially when you are in a building which bounces the sound.<\/p><p>Anyway I prepared in customary style. He had no kit, no gun, no ammo, no place to sleep, little food and no idea on the rules of the game, even that it was a 24 hour non-stop game! Instead, rolling up on the motorbike with a sleeping bad half falling out of the top box. 'You are joking!!' Thankfully Michael and the Madhatters provided the rest. First night, Friday, was spent in the tent on uncomfortable ground. Having being told to man-up and not bring two sleeping bags and balaclava, Michael had two of everything and an airbed! Last time I'll listen to that advice!!<\/p><p>Over 300 competitors, 80 odd buildings at Copehill, Salisbury plain, a military training location. The shouty, swear mongering sergent major figure outlining the rules at the equivilent of the FA Cup final event, barked out if everyone had done Airsofting before. Clearly everyone had... other than Myself and Michael, but we were no way going to admit that. We started at 11am as reserves, clearing houses where enemy stragglers were situated. In our Madhatters section there were seven of us, lead by Rich. To begin with communications were good. The platoon leader would give, Rich orders and he'd relay them on and we all stuck together. Nearer the end it was a case of get together if you can. Still it did not ruin the experience. Some other teams were like well oiled machines. The 'Tigers' section were the in-house, home team. It was a slick operation watching them perform house clearences.<\/p><p>After our initial task, we got bogged down in a group of 4 houses in a fire fight on the front line for about 3 hours. One of the idiosyncrasies of us fighting men was to stop for tea break back at the campsite. We had the finest leaf tea money could buy served with the china tea set that Alex had bought for 25 pounds! We all agreed it was a spiffing brew and decided to go and give the hun a jolly good boff on head for not playing with a straight bat!!<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_03_25-02-AirsoftWithTheMadhatters.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Daddy in the army' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Daddy in the army<\/p><p>After a slow start with the gun, I managed to kind of get hang of it. By the end of the game I was getting frustrated at how quick the ammo was going I was firing so much. After the tea break we had lost a lot of ground and so a new environment and set of problems to overcome. As night fell we were tasked to defend the ammo compound. Not one of us fired a weapon for about an hour. Humiliatingly one of the 'tans' (the opposition) walked up to our building said 'how are you?', to which we replied, then he shot me with a pistol from close range and knife killed Brett and then took our 'intel'. Our excuse was that we couldn't tell in the dark which side he was on, the truth was, we were embarrassingly caught off guard. It was pitch black in the building, but some of the enemy had \"night vision\", effectively being able to see in the dark! I couldn't even see to the end of the room I was in. To add to this was the fact that most competitors had tracer rounds and I did not, so even if I did shoot I would not be able to see where I was aiming at. These disadvantages and a cracking headache I decided to make use of Michal's airbed and turn in early with the thought of getting up at first light.<\/p><p>At 5:45 I got up, scraped the frost from my gun and kit and went into battle leaving others in bed. I felt very refreshed and got a second wind of enthusiasm. It all seemed to click in to place now. Movement, tactics, gun usage. I had a lot of fun. My highlight was being the last survisor on the top flight of Bangalore School. I had enemy firing at me from all angles. No one else in the building. My allies all on one side of the building firing at the enemy on the other side of the building. I killed two by just reaching out of the window and firing below me. It was such a buzz. Alas I ran out of ammo and had to go back and re-stock.<\/p><p>The game ended 11am on the Sunday morning, a full 23 hours, with the clocks moving forward. I wanted more, but my feet did not! We lost narrowly and after the results, a debrief and packing up the tents we all parted ways back to civilazation. A cracking weekend.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_03_25-AirsoftWithTheMadhatters.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Airsoft, Section 3, aka The Madhatters' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Airsoft, Section 3, aka The Madhatters<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Airsoft Weekend"},"version":5},{"date":{"d":24,"m":3,"y":2012},"datev":20120324,"info":{"content":"<p>Over the past two weeks we had both Katie and Ben's parents evening.

Not because he is lazy, but because he wants to get on to the next thing. He's basically doing very well and we couldn't ask for more from him. Katie on the other hand.... no Katie is also doing well. Having Mrs Farage as a teacher has made such a difference as Katie loves her. As such she is progressing so much better than she was last year. All round she is a lot more confident in class. She is doing well in reading.<\/p><p>To this weekend. Daddy was away (see Sunday's account). Ben had football in the morning which the team lost 2-0. Again he played about half the match, watching the ball go past him mostly. Harsh but true.<\/p><p>In the afternoon we went over to Auntie Ellie's to stay the night. we played with Joey and Lily as usual. However, we were very, very naughty. We finished dinner early and asked to go out and play. We were told only to play on the grass at the back of the house, instead we went across two roads to the playground.

We made our way out of one of the gates into Home Park which led us past the deer and playing logs up to Kingston bridge. <\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_01_22-06-HamptonCourtBikeRide.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Formal Gardens, Hampton Court Palace' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Formal Gardens, Hampton Court Palace<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2012\/2012_01_22-20-HamptonCourtBikeRide.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The gang in Home Park, Hampton Court' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The gang in Home Park, Hampton Court<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Hampton Court Palace Bike Ride"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":21,"m":1,"y":2012},"datev":20120121,"info":{"content":"<p>Another busy Saturday, first up Jessica to ballet, then Ben to football which was a bit of a mission.

It was very peaceful and the weather quite mild. Daddy just wore a pair of shorts! The Fars went for a cross country drive around the surrounding area and met up at Shiplake Lock where they met up and had a cup of coffee. Next step was to navigate around the lock without the lock keeper noticing as Daddy does not have a license to paddle on the Thames. First attempt was met by a home owner who shoed Daddy off as he was trespassing. Instead, he went across the other side of the river, dragged his boat across the mini island which the lock keeper's house was on and got back on the water. A final mile stretch to Shiplake (just south of Henley) ended this peaceful and enjoyable trip.

Walked to Mortlake railway station, caught the train to Hampton Wick, with paddles, seats, lunch, etc. Walked to the Kayak and set sail towards Teddington at 9:35. Only 8 more miles to go.<\/p><p>Daddy started at quite a leisurely pace thinking that 8 miles in 3 hours was quite achievable. I mean it was supposed to be enjoyable and leisurely. However, it turned into a bit of a challenge and a race against the tide and time.<\/p><p>Ben was most helpful. In fact he commented that Daddy wouldn't have made it if it wasn't for him. True he did provide paddling assistance, even though it might not always have propelled us forward. He did also pass the sandwiches back, he made the kayak lighter when we stopped for the toilet 3 times and dropped the map into the river twice! However, it is questionable whether playing Sudoku on the phone or dropping his paddle into the river was gaining us time. The sweetest thing was near the end when Daddy was exerting a lot of effort and grunting away, Ben just started chanting 'Come On Daddy, come on. Come on Daddy come on'. Daddy could have given him the biggest cuddle.<\/p><p>We had some lunch which we ate onboard. We saw some nice wildlife, birds with big beaks, some nice houses, not many boats and lots of rowers. Ben was following the written plan. Interested in the train timetable and following ourselves on the map along the river. I think it did go on quite a time for the both of them. Ben wouldn't admit he was bored and always gave a positive outlook, however, Daddy suspects he would have been happy to stop after a couple of hours.<\/p><p>We eventually pulled the kayak out at 1:30pm and rushed home just about in time for Jessica's birthday.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2011\/2011_09_10-03-KingstonMortlakeKayak.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Ben kayaking' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Ben kayaking<\/p><p>This year Jessica's birthday party was going to be held at Tomlinscote School's sport hall, with inflatables, mats, toys, etc. Jessica has been so excited about her party. We think a 4 year old is probably the best age for this. For the past month Jeissca asks 'is it my party tomorrow?'<\/p><p>We had a mix of family, playschool friends and other friends coming along, which was really nice to see. Jessica was connected by an invisible magnetic force to her best friend Amy Huggits. They are so sweet together giving each other cuddles and generally looking out for each other.<\/p><p>After an hour of playtime we had party food around the back and a nice hedgehog cake.

First up the one where you need an inflatable. We went down.... and then up in some parts. Brilliant. We all loved it. There were two other slides as well which were very good. Jessica had plenty of things to play in as well. There was this board surfer thing as well. A seperate area to simulate a surf where gushing water was poured through and you had to balance your self on a body board. I guess you can use it to practice surfing.<\/p><p>We done our 2 hours and sped north out of the city, up through the valleys and stopped off somewhere very countrified for a nice little picnic. We then continued our journey to the Welsh National Show Caves or Dan Yr Ogof as the locals would say. Well we spent Â£50 on what amounted to a 2.5 hour stay. Not value for money. Saying that, we went in some good caves. A year ago Katie was quite scared, but she'd overcome that fear over the past year. Jessica however was a little more aware and took the 'scaredy cat' baton. Still it was all very pretty inside and Daddy mucked about with his camera settings to get a few firey looking shots.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2011\/2011_08_19-03-WalesHoliday-WalesNationalShowCaves.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Picnic' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Picnic<\/p><p>Not only were there caves, but the largest collection of Dinosaurs in the world, all life sized in the woods.

Daddy went out in the city centre for a wonder and saw the Millenium Stadium. It was all dark and locked up unfortunately. Overnight there was trouble in the room next to us.

The Gower was Mummy's childhood holiday destination. For about 10 years the Weston took the caravan down the Gower for their annual beach holiday. Mummy and Daddy went here over 10 years ago, but it's nice to come back to show the children around. As we left the rather disapointing Pembroke Dock, a local told us to visit a local waterfall and walk, so we did. It was called Penllergaer Valley Woods. We had a great time building a dam in the stream, although it was freezing cold.  Only Daddy saw the waterfall as the rest of us were getting peckish and went back to the car. We love a valley walk with a stream. Oh the excitement.<\/p><p>Finally the Gower and Llanmadoc. The tide was out and there must have been a miles worth of walking to the actually sea from the start of the beach. Anyway the beach was gorgeous, so clean, spacious and sandy. Other families were building dams on contributories to the sea. So we continued the trend and built one which was the first that was successful. Well for about 20 minutes anyway. Once the dam broke all the other downstream dams had to cope with a relative torrent! We did walk the mile to the sea where Katie and Jessica were doing some kind of sand dancing. That Jessica has got a screw lose I swear. We hooked up with a couple of families whilst there. One from Brighton who helped maintain the dams and another local who had a real broad Wlesh accent. We love it. She thought Folly Farm was expensive, when we thought it was good value. She didn't have much money, so it's all relative I supose.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2011\/2011_08_18-00-WalesHoliday-TheGower.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Tai Chi Jessa' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Tai Chi Jessa<\/p><p>Anyway we then drove what seemed to be an eternity looking for other beaches that Mummy frequented. We went to Oxwich Bay, which wasn't the beach we were looking for. We then went to Southgate, got out for a short walk, but still not the beach we were looking for. The final Beach was Caswell Bay, which Mummy pretended to be the beach we were looking for as she was too afraid to admit it was the wrong one. We spent all afternoon driving from one cove to another. Anyway, we stopped as the beautiful Caswell Bay, played a bit of cricket, climbed some rocks, Katie went in the sea which was a brave feat seeing it was pretty cold. We had a nice time there, although Daddy's childhood cricket bat got stolen!<\/p><p>We travelled to the Mumbles, but time was marching on and we had to get to our hotel in the centre of Swansea as well as find a pizzeria for dinner. We eventually got to the hotel very late after driving around Swansea a bit. The hotel was right in the centre of the city and we were 5 floors up, along with a load of A-Level students. We were expecting a noisey night. To the students credit, we didn't hear a peak and we all slept soundly.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2011\/2011_08_18-38-WalesHoliday-TheGower.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Rock Climbers' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Rock Climbers<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Wales Holiday - The Gower"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":17,"m":8,"y":2011},"datev":20110817,"images":5,"info":{"content":"<p>We woke latish and got our picnic supplies for the day, before exiting the slightly disapointing Pembroke Dock and arriving at Folly Farm.

There was so much to do in the park. I think 'Farm' understated what actually was on offer. There were plenty of adventure playgrounds and ride on tractors. I think that alone could have consumed our day. We went in the indoor barn where Katie and Ben had a go at milking a goat. Katie said it was like Ben's winky!<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2011\/2011_08_17-34-WalesHoliday-FollyFarmTenby.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='George Pig with Jessica Pig' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>George Pig with Jessica Pig<\/p><p>Next up was the tractor ride which took us around fields of pigs, horses, donkies, lamas, deer and goats.

We saw zebras, red river boars, a monkey, reindeer, tortoise, osterich and a bongo.

Not tacky or over commercialized, but full of nice cafes and boutiques. We stepped in one of the cafes which was offering free childrens food. Mummy and Daddy had lasagne, whilst Jessica and Ben had meatballs and pasta. Finally a day without chips. The weather had been fine all day.

We had our cereal in our room and made a hasty exit to get to Llanbaris station by 9am. We have a suitcase and about 10 small bags to transport between car and hotel room so it's always a bit of a mission to get out in the morning. Daddy stupidly left Mummy in charge of booking the train tcikets. She bought the expensive tickets so cost us Â£69! It was only a 5 mile journey. Daddy said it was far too long for us to walk back and said that's why the plan said a return ticket! Anyway the evocitive smell of steam trains made Daddy forget about the expense and fall in love with steam again. It was a quaint station, red paint everywhere. We got into compartment B and we were steadily pushed up the mountain by a dirty diesel. We saw a gushing river beside us which turned into a spectacular waterfall a little higher up. There were sheep grazing in the most dangerous of places. At the edge of cliff faces it seemed. One false move and it was 'baaaah splat'. We shared seats with a daddy and a 5 year old who very kindly shared his sweets. We got chatting and the children played. I don't they were particularly interested after 10 minutes of the hour long climb, especially as the visibility was so poor and misty.<\/p><p>We eventually reached the end stop. We spent 15 minutes eating some food in the cafe and deliberating whether to take the train down. Experienced climbers cme to us and basically laughed at the fact that we were going to attempt to walk down the mountain. A couple of blokes said our passage down would be extremely windy, coupled with the rain it would be a miserable descent. What swung it for Daddy was the fact that those who had climbed the mountain were soaked through even though they wore all the best gear. Daddy was still reluctant as it had cost close to Â£70 to get up and the thought of a total spend of Â£140 was killing him. Even though he was only wearing shorts he was prepared to walk down to save money. The station master took pity and only charged us half price for the five of us to go down.<\/p><p>Having sorted all that out we ventured out, climbed the steps to the top, saw nothing but mist, cold rain and wind before swivelling 180 degrees to return to the cafe and the train.<\/p><p>It was an expensive disapointment due to the poor weather.

Daddy is learning how to pick them up. He's still not sure on the best technique without being pinsered. The beach was quite shingley so was unable to make any sandcastles.

Arriving at about 5:30pm, the place was a bit of a has-been place. Past glories and all that. After checking in, we walked down the high street for food and the place was pretty deserted. We were after pizza, there was only Chinese or Fish and Chips. We bought chipies and took them to a park which overlooked the bay.

Therefore he rallied the troop and set off for a walkabout Chester. First the amputheatre where Katie and Ben put on a little performance. Then we went passed the city walls, and old, old church, through the gardens and down to a suspension bridge spanning the Dee. We posed for some photos before walking along the lovely promenade back to the car. We had forgotten the pushchair in that unmentionable restaurant and funnily enough none of the staff could help us.

Let's swim across to our own adventure island! Katie a little more wise was a reluctant participant as she and Daddy could see how cold the water was going to be, and how rocky that man made island looked. We tip toed up to our chest before Ben could take it no more and returned to shore, leaving Daddy being encouraged by Katie to get in the water and swim across to the island. It was flipping cold but they both made it across. Katie was extremely sweet taking care of Daddy making sure he was OK. They reached the sumit of the rocks waved, played for a bit and then struggled against the current to get back on to the mainland!<\/p><p>Just across the road was a nice park with a paddling pool and swings so we went there for half an hour. Jessica being particularly cheeky with her bottom wiggles. That was fun.<\/p><p>We then had another hours journey west to Gypsy Wood. This place was hard to describe. It was in the same atmosphere as Black Gang Chine with its tacky ornaments spread through out the park. It was on a much smaller scale, and something a bit different for us to do. There was a model railway where you could control the speed and direction of the trains, a romany caravan which we loved playing in, plenty of small farm animals where Jessica actually stroked a goat and of course a play area. We went on the wetlands walk and finally saw the fairy godmother who painted a small tatoo on our arms. Mummy loved the place as much as we did. Again we stayed till closing time at 5pm.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2011\/2011_08_15-58-WalesHoliday-RhosOnSeaGypsyWoodCaernarfon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Meeting the Fairy Godfather' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Meeting the Fairy Godfather<\/p><p>We headed 3 miles north to Caenarfon, dropped the bags off at the hotel and walked about the town.

Well that's what Bracknell would do to me at 6:30 on a Sunday morning!<\/p><p>We made good progress and stopped just a couple of times and reached Chester zoo at 10:15. Believed to be the largest zoo in the country. We got stuck at the kiosk as the man said that the online tickets we had purchased were used the day before. He finally let us in and straight away we saw a family of 5 elephants. There were two real young'uns playing with each other up and down a slope. Another of the older elephants was demolishing a large branch of leaves. Fascinating seeing it snap and chomp at the wood. The weight of their excrement exceeds the weight of Daddy and Katie but together on a daily basis!<\/p><p>We next saw some amazing monkies which were swinging about, playing around, preening one another and generally very absorbing to watch. We all thought that Ben was most like a monkey. He agreed. We went anti-clockwise around the park, seeing all sorts of animals from rhinos to bats to fat old snakes. Katie was braver than mummy in going into the Bat'ery. We saw a pelican, a zebra, a lion which was roaring pretty loud later on, a beautiful jaguar, a cheetah, orangutans, baboons, serval and meerkats. The tigers were hidden which was a bit of a disapointment, but overall we rated the zoo highly and stayed till the end, 6pm.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2011\/2011_08_14-67-WalesHoliday-ChesterZoo.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Spot the Gorilla' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Spot the Gorilla<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2011\/2011_08_14-47-WalesHoliday-ChesterZoo.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Mummy and Daddy' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Mummy and Daddy<\/p><p>Our hotel was a short drive away and overlooked the amputheatre in Chester city centre.

A bit nerve racking, will the children behave themselves in front of the CEO and family. We started off playing with Dane and his family before embarking on a full on game of rounders. Ben was very keen to play and endeered everyone with his enthusasm. Katie was a little shy, and although wanted to participate in her heart, her head said no. Mummy also joined in. After being thrashed, we started a game of football. Ben again very enthusiastic. Meanwhile, Lena, the CEO's wife, took Katie and Jessica and made up some jewelery bags which was very kind of her.

What possibly could go wrong?<\/p><p>Enter, Laura Joy Gay, aka Mummy. As we were about to set off Mummy comes running out in her pyjamas saying she wants to come as well. We can't fit her bike onto the car so Daddy said he'd ride her bike down there, whilst Mummy drives down with all the other bikes on the rack. Daddy impressed on Mummy to be really careful because the bikes on the rack only just fit on, and Ben's bike is basically balancing preariously.<\/p><p>Daddy last 2 yards down the road when he fell off because Mummy had forgot to mention that her handle bars were loose, so that it did not affect the direction you travelled in. It was funny to see Daddy on the fllor. Anyway Daddy managed to tighten up the steering column and off he went. We soon caught up with him on Deepcut road. First speed hump approached, Mummy did not heed Daddy's warnings (apparently she forgot!) and the bikes all jumped in the air, how Ben's did not fall off I do not know! A lucky escape. Daddy couldn not believe his eyes.<\/p><p>When Daddy trundelled into Frimley Lodge park he saw a pile of bikes on the floor in the middle of the road leading into the car park. Mummy hadn't 'appreciated' the 2 metre height limit and the bike came crashing down! Fortunately there was not much other traffic about and not too many scratches. However, Katie's front wheel wouldn't go around anymore! Daddy re-attached the brakes and we were all good again.<\/p><p>We started heading towards Mytchett, Jessica was on the baby seat on the back of Daddy's bike and they followed Ben down some mountain bike trails as Ben called them. However, he stopped seemingly for no reason down a cutting leading daddy to stop abruptly, loosing his balance, causing Jessica to fall sideways into a prickle bush. With all those spots on her face anyway you could almost see the comic value of it all. She howled, Daddy unpricked all the prickles from her hands.<\/p><p>Stress levels also rose when ever we passed a dog off it's lead. Hysterics from Katie and Jessica, as Ben blindly went on up the Canal path, quite close the edge at times! We eventually got to Mytchett only to find the swivel bridge over to the playground had been turned so you couldn't cross. Instead we decided to head back to Frimley Lodge Park and go on their swings. This surprisingly went withough incident.<\/p><p>It was getting late and because of the rack capacity issue, Mummy was going to cycle home. Katie and Ben both also wanted to cycle back with her. Katie didn't want Ben cycling for some reason so tantrums ensued. Daddy and Jessica drove him and got talking to next door. Un be known to them, Katie's peddle had now fallen off her bike causing her to fall off, tears, the lot. Katie, Ben and Mummy walked to Grandma's and phoned for Daddy to pick them up. Daddy was fixing next door's strimmer at this point. It was going past 8pm now. Eventually Daddy got the call to come and collect us!

We parked up at Uncle Philips house who was unfortunately out, but saved us paying Â£6 car parking fee! It boasted the largest \/ best playground in Europe. I wouldn't have said that, quite big, but I would say Longleat and Druscilla's had better. After a go on the aforementioned playground, Katie and Mummy went on the pirate ship. Daddy said it looked liked it went very high, Katie came off the ride saying it didn't go high enough! We meandered through the park taking it in turns to have a go on rides. Daddy and Ben went on the dodgems, Jessica on the tug boat ride. We were limited in the number of rides we could go on, and it was a little more restrictive than Pleasure Island in Cleethorpes. i.e. Many rides had to be accompanied by an adult.<\/p><p>Wicksteed Park has lots of park land. Plenty enough for us to sit down have a picnic overseeing the rest of the park that we hadn't been to yet. We headed over to the umbrella ride. We calculated that we did not have enough to go on the log flume and racing cars. It was getting quite hot, and we all caught the sun abit.<\/p><p>We headed over to the far end of the park where Daddy had a go on the flying log which is hard to describe and nothing like it at anything park. Basically you are but in a one man toboggan, on rails, raised about 25 feet, then let go, racing down the rails, with a mini ski slope bit at the end meaning you jump in the air and land in a lake of water. Wicked!<\/p><p>Katie kindly treeted us children to an ice cream each with her own birthday money which was very kind of her. We went on boat ride from 1923, the car ride from the 60's and finally on the train around the park. We were all getting quite tired by now. We had another sneaky go on the playground before walking back the mile long course to the car. Uncle Philip was busy wit a photo shoot, so returned home via some bad M1 traffic and a chip shop. 3.5 hour return journey!<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2011\/2011_07_24-30-Katie8thBirthdayWicksteedPark.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Our 8 year old' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Our 8 year old<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2011\/2011_07_24-13-Katie8thBirthdayWicksteedPark.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Mummy and Jessica ladybirding it up' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Mummy and Jessica ladybirding it up<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2011\/2011_07_24-23-Katie8thBirthdayWicksteedPark.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Mummy and Jessica ladybirding it up' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Mummy and Jessica ladybirding it up<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Katie's 8th Birthday - Wicksteed Park"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":23,"m":7,"y":2011},"datev":20110723,"info":{"content":"<p>The Wests came over in the afternoon.

The mash scraped onto the edge of the plate, the pie nothing special. A bit disapointing really.<\/p><p>After leaving we got Jess and Katie their lunch and walked up Hoxton high street which had a low-end market running. We headed east towards Victoria Park, another haunt Daddy wanted to visit, just because again alot of old addresses were from that area. Walking there we saw a lot of boarded up flats. Seemed quite a poor area. An old black gentleman sitting on a bench high fived us all as we walked passed. The children were not scared, which we expected. Members of our party were begining to flag. We walked up Broadway Market which was a pocket of class in an otherwise impoverished area. A recommendation to the Fars for this place. We went slighlty out of our way as we hit London Fields. Patience was running thin. We eventually made it to Victora Park only to find the playground was shut for maintenance!<\/p><p>Ben decided he needed another wee didn't hide to well when tiddling up a tree. That boy! We continued walking to Bethnal Green tube where there was the biggest police presense we've ever seen. There must have been 20+ police vans and seemingly 100's of officers all surrounding the pub. Apparently they were there to prevent some gang fight. A lot of poilce!<\/p><p>A welcome relief to be off our feet we returned on the tube back to South Wimbledon.

Very soon we had attracted a whole table of drawerers all very eager to show off their talents to Daddy.

There was a lot of sitting on the mat and listening and answering question. It was first about recycling which involved some art work.

Anyway it was tiring, but Daddy completed it in a touch over 20 minutes. Ellie did well and peddled in a couple of minute later. They were exhausted but found the energy to find the pub. The Yauchstman overlooked a tributary to the Solent. It was beautiful with old, red brick, worker cottages lining the grass driveway. Everyone piled in behind and took a BBQ lunch, except for Daddy who made his own sandwiches!<\/p><p>Time was pressing, so reluctantly they decided to part ways with Bucklers Hard and shift north along the country roads. For the last mile of the journey back to the carpark, Daddy and Uncle Michael raced. It was a close run affair.<\/p><p>Still mid afternoon, some of us wanted to continue cycling and some were quite happy to flake out and recover on a blanket in the wilderness. Uncle Michael found a couple of Geo-Caches that they could find, so headed off road into the woods. They eventually navigated our way to the first geo-cache in a spooky wood, Auntie Ellie signed her name in the book, then moved off towards Hatchet Pond where they stopped off for an ice cream. They were quite expensive, some costing Â£10! Unfortunately another chap was also geo-caching so gave the second spot away a bit. Still as they say in the geo-caching game; 'a geo-cache is a geo-cache. Doesn't matter how you get them'. Well that's what I imagine them saying.<\/p><p>They returned back to the van, went to the hotel where they freshened up, watched England perform abismally against Switzerland and then had the saga of getting to a pub for the evening's entertainments and food. Some bright spark thought that if the youngsters cycle it would mean one less car driver on the road. They picked a pub just a few miles away only to find it was shut for renovation! They asked a local for the next nearest pub, but was unable to find an interpreter to convert the New Forest accent to Estuary English! Michael tippy tapped again and the computer said the New Forest Inn, Emery Down. They ordered food, decided that Uncle Howard wasn't keen on pear cider, Martin got an insight to his Asian friend and Uncle Peter was defending the vegetarian sausage!<\/p><p>Hometime, and it was pitch black which was a bit of a problem when you don't have lights for your bike and you are travelling down country lanes!

Mummy for some reason headed in an arc direction sort of away from the horse at a fast, nervous pace which quickened when the horse set it's eyes on them and started to walk towards them. Laura then ran, which made the horse run, which inturn made Jessica scream. Real panic set in. The horse slowed to a walk as it got closer to Mummy and Jessica. Daddy and Katie who were behind just calmly walked past the horse to the otherside of the field. The horse did give some heavy snorts as if he was not pleased that we crossed his field.<\/p><p>At the other end of the field there was a stream with a bridge, so we played Pooh sticks. I think we must play Pooh sticks more than anyone else as it is a game we play everytime we cross a stream!

We couldn't understand why so much time had to be taken between shots, we were both getting a bit impatient.<\/p><p>We decided to follow the Dane Anders Anderson who wasn't playing particularly well. He partnered a Scotsman called Whiteford. We were amazed to see him smoking as he walked down the fairway. Cheeky. On our way round we were stopped by someone who Farfar knew from football of course. He's been coming to watch for years for free by walking over some woods onto the course. Music to Daddy's ears. We'll have to try that one in a future year.<\/p><p>They ended on the popular 14th hole, seeing Anders par another hole. Both getting a bit tired (poor them), they decided to head back home. A nice day at the golf finalizing a good few weeks of top sport for Daddy.<\/p><p>In the evening Auntie Ellie took Joey and Ben over to Ma Ma and Pop Pops for a sleepover. Ben insisted on watching the rugby highlights from the day before and was reported to be a bit of a know it all at a quiz that they played! Is he turning into a bit of a big head? He stayed the night.<\/p><p>Account from Auntie Ellie:<\/p><p>I met Auntie Ellie at the Farnham roundabout and travelled to Ma Ma's in her car with Joey. We listened to Horrid Henry all the way as Auntie Ellie does not like to talk when on the motorway! When we got to Ma Ma and Pop Pops it was about 7 so we played some games with Ma Ma and watched a bit of Garfield but I didn't like it. At about 8, Auntie Ellie supposedly went home so we all said our goodbyes. Just before bed, Ma Ma read some Where's Wally with us - big mistake: when Pop Pops lifted Joey in the night for a wee poor Joey got upset and said he was having nightmares about Wheres Wally. Ma Ma did some of her special Ma Ma magic and managed to make Auntie Ellie appear from upstairs. Joey was very happy and snuggled up with his Mummy. The next day it was decided Auntie Ellie could join Joey and Me on our boys trip to the Grandparents.<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"PGA European Golf Championships, Ben over to Ma Ma and Pop Pops"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":28,"m":5,"y":2011},"datev":20110528,"images":1,"info":{"content":"<p>Last night we had Natasha Kelly stay over for a sleepover.<\/p><p>In the morning we had to drop the motorbike off for its MOT, this was followed by Mummy helping out at Cross Farm School and the rest of us going to Farfars to play with his new train set.<\/p><p>Daddy managed to get some free tickets for the Rugby Premiership final at Twickenham.

We eventually made it home via the Friday rushhour (the M1 was shut). Luckily mummy had ordered the shopping online before we left.

Our thoughts of another seaside town that was tacky, rundown and had seen better days. We were pleasantly surprised, as it was pretty popular, the town looked pretty respectable, the fairground bit had been given a fresh lick of paint and had some decent rides and it was quite tacky. Great Grandma had given each of us Â£3.30 spending money. Jessica spent it in the arcade on sit on rides and sweets, Ben bought a Bow and Arrow set, then asked 30 minutes later if we had the receipt to take it back, and Katie spent it on sweets and the arcades as well. There was a nice park next to the seafront which we went in, before returning back to the car via the pier and swings. Plenty for us to see there.<\/p><p>We hurried home and Daddy stoked up the BBQ before going over for the evening entertainments, Another show, a fancydress competition and a science show.

We got there before the gates opened so there was a bit of a queue. Although it was sunny, and we even managed to catch the sun, the North Sea winds were cutting through the 10 degrees temperature. Entrance price of Â£66 was reasonably good value. It is hard to describe the position which Pleasure Island stands in the ladder of theme parks. It is not quite as well established as the southern efforts or Drayton Manor, however it had a lot more to offer than Paulton's Park or Alice In Wonderland. More importantly it had something to offer all of us, more than expected for Jessica. Not sure if it was because it was the first day of opening for the year or because of the cool temperature, but there weren't lots of people inside the park. We didn't have to queue more than 15 minutes for any of the rides. Jessica enjoyed the catapillar rollercoaster and big slide the best, Katie the Gravitron and Ben everything that was fast and G-Force intensive! We spent the whole day on rides. Daddy now feeling old as his yurning for thrill rides has been overtaken by the effects on his stomach! We had a really great family day, many of the rides we could all do together. There were rides which the bigger parks wouldn't be able to cope with due to the number of  people. e.g. Both Katie and Ben went on the water walkers. Brilliant. We stopped when the gates closed at 5pm. We returned back to the camp and went off to watch a Cinderella pantomime in the ballroom.

However, there was no market to speak of, but went around the dock area which was very interesting. Quite industrial and obviously it had seen better days, with half the units being empty. However what had survived was great. Walking around the back of the units you saw crates of fish heads. There was loads of rubbish. Anyway the other four were fast becoming bored so we had to leave and head back to camp. On the way home we stopped off for lunch in a playground at Grainthorpe.<\/p><p>We went to use the camp facilities in the afternoon. First the softplay, then adventure playground, the swimming pool and the crazy golf, before ending up in the ballroom for the Rory and the Dragon stage production. All the children enjoyed it, and now we feel Jessica is old enough to enjoy a pantomime. We quickly headed back to the static to have pizza (we got the gas cooker working), then Mummy, Katie and Ben returned to the ballroom to see a magic show. This show was slightly different in that they showed how to do the tricks. When we returned home to Daddy we tried some tricks on him. We got everyone wrong! Oh well.

We popped over to the Fars to pick up the National Trust cards, then got on the M3 and was welcomed by the Monday morning London bound traffic!

We walked passed an old water mill, went over some bridges. Ben ran off to play on a tree which was ladened with stinging nettles. Well you know what is going to hapen next.... well a little boy did fall into the nettles but it wasn't Ben! Still we helped collect dock leaves for the boy who was screaming in pain. We then hit a field of cows which we had to walk through. Mummy's hackles were up and any little attempt of humour such as Moo or 'quick the cows are coming', Mummy got in a mood and quickened her step away from the animals. We all laughed at her.

I swear Ben is the clumsiest boy that ever lived. His brain and body are not connected as one. He splilt half a pack of crisps just by walking along. Not sure how he done that. Anyway we headed next to the church and visited Roald's grave before moving onto Little Missenden to start our 4 mile trek! It was a mud fest. Ben slipped over in the mud at least 10 times, and Katie got stuck in a big puddle and then fell in it!... and didn't we know about it! The walk was pleasant enough, taking in Fantastic Mr Foxes farm. Mud and puddles were a bit of a problem. At first all very jovielle up until the point Katie got stuck in a muddy puddle, try to heave herself out and ended up getting a little wet. Anyone would have thought she was drowning. Mummy rushing over to save her! Goodness me what a performance. 'I want to go home' and all that. After a calming down period of apprximately 15 minutes, we continued through farmers fields, muddy paths and kissing gates. Someone always gets the bum deal and has to kiss Daddy, who gives out licks rather than kisses! Urrgghhh.<\/p><p>We saw some Red Kites, all large birds now are Red Kites because we can't tell the difference between them all. We saw a phesant in the middle of the path, which scurried off when we got near to him and the usual sheep, cows and horses.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2011\/2011_02_24-30-Missenden.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Danny Champion Of The World petrol station in Gt.

Yes a day trip to the mighty Billund airport which is smack bang in the middle of Jutland, the pinisula poking up from Germany.<\/p><p>We left at 4:05am and by the time we got to Red Road Farfar was bemoaning the slowness of the car infront! However, we made Standsted in good time and took our Ryanair flight without any issues. No stops to explain taking a syringe and needles!<\/p><p>We landed and walked out into a -5 centigrade wall of coldness. A full 10 degrees difference to home, plus some windchill factor as well. There was snow on the ground, but the Danes handle it very well. Even the cycle paths are gritted!<\/p><p>We collected our hire car and headed first to Grinsted for some 10 o'clock breakfast. A typical town, full of no traffic and no people it seemed. After Daddy recovered from a hypo, we found a cafe type place which was a little out of the ordinary. It happened to be a lady's 50th birthday so it was an open house. Free food. Result. Not only that, there was a great Danish meal time atmosphere and the food was absolutely what the doctor ordered at that time. Some lovely oat type breads, granary rolls, pastries and of course a flask of coffee. Daddy really enjoyed it there.<\/p><p>After swanning around the shop we had to quickly move on if we were to complete our missions today. Daddy took over the driving and Farfar the navigating. We headed to the west coast and a place translated to White Sands (Hvide Sande). It was quite literally 'white sands' as the snow covered the beach. We stopped half way up this spit of land and looked in a couple of fish shops, one with live lobsters in it. Can't take anything back unfortunately. Farmor treated us to a Fish buffet in a nice restaurant for lunch. We had everything from King Eel, Salmon, Prawns, Herring, Mackeral and some other fish which I don't know what they really were. It was interesting chatting to some locals who reacalled eating fish for breakfast 4 times a week when their family worked as fisherman.<\/p><p>Farmor and Daddy went for a walk on the beach which only lasted 10 minutes because it was so unbeliveably, bitterly cold. Daddy's ear almost frooze off!<\/p><p>Time was marching on and a realization that we were not going to do everything planned came upon us. So top priority was..... going to some charity shop over an hour away! So be it. We eventually got to Them, and as charity shops go, it was alright, not one Daddy would step into even if it was down Frimley high street. Still the Fars rated it, and for all our efforts and sacrifices, the only thing purchased was a pair of clogs for Â£3!<\/p><p>A trip with the Fars always includes a Ying and Yang match up between Farfar wanting to squeeze in another destination, usually at the cost of arriving on time at the final destination, against Farmor's arrive in plenty of time approach. As usual Farfar got his way and we stopped off in Ejstrupholm and had a bit of a comedy moment as Daddy and Farfar ran around a graveyard looking for Daddy's Great Grandparents headstone which had moved since the last time they were there. They only had 5 minutes to find it. The stopwatch chimed and they had to abort and rush to get diesel and return back to the airport.<\/p><p>We arrived back in England at 8pm and all that Mummy was interested in was what presents were bought for her, and of course the children!<\/p><p>A thoroughly enjoyable day with some nice food and a little taste of Denmark along with a splattering of humour with the Fars!<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2011\/2011_02_22-11-JutlandRoadMap.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Jutland 1 day Road trip' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Jutland 1 day Road trip<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Daddy to Jutland, Denmark"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":21,"m":2,"y":2011},"datev":20110221,"images":1,"info":{"content":"<p>Daddy has the week off work and so is about to play with.

It all got a bit embarrassing at the tower with Mummy running around paniced and barking orders at Jessica and Daddy to hurry up as the tower was about to close. Anyway funnily enough we made it with plenty of time to spare and climbed to the top. The views were magnificent.

Ma ma had done the night shift and Mummy and Ellie went in at 6am to relive her. Unfortunately Grandad's breathing became extremely lengthy, 20 seconds between in each breath. Mummy was holding his hand and talking to Ellie and Uncle Howard on previous events and what a lovely man he was. He passed away peacefully at about 8:30am. The rest of the family were informed and a message passed to the church so they could pray for him.<\/p><p>When Mummy and Auntie Ellie returned, we decided to get out of the house, have a runabout and get some fresh air. Daddy had another hypoglycemic attack, worse than yesterday's, this time he also got the sweats. Mummy rushed to the shops to get some sugars.

It made Daddy laugh when some of the boys whined when their hands got dirty!<\/p><p>After footer we headed off on another of our children's walk around London, the fifth one in 3 weeks! This time it was the Watership Down walk, and this time we thought the children were a little young to be introduced to the cartoon. The setting was 50 minutes away on the other side of Kingsclere. Of course the temperature was on freezing and it began to drizzle at the begining of the walk down the road. All in good spirits except of course Jessica. Ben was especially a live wire going up the steep banking, getting his trousers filthy within 10 seconds of setting off and jst loving every second of bein outdoors and being how a child should.<\/p><p>Mummy followed the map pretty well. We got to Watership Down hill itself and there were millions of rabbit holes. We saw just one rabbit scampering up the hill for about 5 seconds before it disapeared. Taking the pushchair was a bit if a mistake as it was pretty bumpy and constantly at an angle as we traversed the bottom of the hill. Ben was climbing the hill, worrying Mummy as it was quite slippery and steep. Casualty number two quickly came with Katie continually moaning that her feet were cold! So we stopped for a picnic as an attempt to revive the spirits. No joy there though. We climbed the hill and finally reached the top where the gallops were. Ben said that the view was 'excellent'. We had to agree with him. We treked through the mud and finally finished the 2 mile walk in good time.

We made a monster lasagne and pizza for dinner. Joey and Lily stayed in Katie and Ben's bed for a couple of hours before finding alternative sleeping arrangements.<\/p><p>Daddy's first couple of days of monitoring and administering have been a bit unsatisfactory in terms of results. The daily routine consists of taking a blood sample before a meal and two hours after a meal, as well as one just before bed. That is 7 blood tests. A blood test involves making a small pin prick on the side of a finger, enough to draw blood. The blood is then soaked on a small piece of special card. Depending on the time of day this rading should be between 4 and 9. Daddy's reading have all been between 11 and 15!... except for once, this evening when it fell below 4 and Daddy started to get the shakes. In other words had a mild hypoglycemic attack, even after a huge lasagne! Obviously it had a low GI count. Anyway after eating and drinking some sugary drinks he returned to normal and an hour later his glucose level had risen to 15! The attack came quite suddenly, e.g. One minute feeling fine, the next feeling quite not as himself. As well as the 7 blood tests, Daddy has to take 4 injections of insulin. This is adminstered with a needle and hopefully because he is inexperienced sometimes stings a bit.

Grandma and their children all went to visit him, but returned soon after as he was not very with it.<\/p><p>Second, Leah, Katie's best friend is leaving school. Therefore, Katie said her next best friend will be Poppy because they take the micky of her name as well. Katie was told that she would marry Poppy because she was Gay. She then clamed up when asked who and in what context. So this is the first time we know that Katie has had some micky taken from her peers about her surname.<\/p><p>Thirdly, Daddy has been really thirsty over the past month and over the past two days has gone for tests. The normal glucose level is 4 to 7 mol. Daddy had three readings 23, 20 and 19! So casually booked a doctors appointment for today. Once in the doctors Daddy had a blood and urine tests. The glucose level was at ++++ as were his ketones ++++. Apparently that was enough pluses for me to be refered to Casualty. So went home, told Mummy the news and told work that I was unlikely to be in for the rest of the day. I thought the doctors appointment would last long enough as my lunch break! Eventually got refered on to the Medical Assessment Unit where Barrie's mum was working.<\/p><p>Another blood test from the artery this time, which was the most painful, then a very unconfident student nurse came to put a cannula in which was a little unnerving. A doctor came to asses and confirm I had Type I diabetes. She said it is a bit of a life changer. Daddy was yet to be convinced. Daddy was then hooked up to some IV fluids for an hour and then another set which lasted two hours! Meanwhile Farmor had popped in to give some reading material as Daddy was bored out of his brain. Apparently most people with that high a blood glucose level would be feeling ill. Daddy had no ill-affects at all nd didn't feel tired, just very hungry. All that fasting. Two weetabix in the morning and that was it.<\/p><p>Whilst the drips were plugged in the Diabetic consultant came round and discussed the ins and outs, and becaues Daddy looked sensible (got that wrong!) she instructed him on how, when and quantities on injecting insulin.<\/p><p>Daddy's main concern was that he had read that it can reduce your life expectancy by 20 years. He was thinking that he would not be old enough so see any great grandchildren! Not sure how accurate the answer I got from the consultant. She made it more 5 years than 20!<\/p><p>Tomorrow he has another appointment to get more information.<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Worst Day Ever?

Ben who really wasn't very confident on skates really excelled and by the end of the session was going around on his own without falling over. He's really improved. Katie on the other hand was being a bit of a madam and was moaning away, not sure if it was through tiredness (because she doesn't go to sleep in bed easily) or whether it was down to being hungry..... which is always the case. Over the last couple of months it feels at time as if Katie has turned into a teenager. Moody and talking about boys, constantly hungry and sometimes not speaking nicely to the grown ups. Other times she is really sweet, a caring sister and fun to be with. I expect we have more of that to come.<\/p><p>After SkateJam we went home and prepared for our walk. This is the third in our series. We were determined this wouldn't be disasterous like the previous two: the first we forgot coats, the second we got lost..... and this time, we left the picnic in the bag in the front room! A typical Gay day out!<\/p><p>No matter, we continued and arrived at a sunny Turville, the setting of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. As preparation we watched the 2.5 hour film yesterday and we all loved it. Turville is a little village with a good pub, church, red telephone box, old cottages, and the windmill from the film up on top of the hill. You get the picture a quaint English village.<\/p><p>We started our 2.5 mile walk up a muddy path and ventured into lots of farmers fields and lots of hills. It had been raining pretty solidly for the past 2 days, so at times we had to drag the pushchair through the mud which was quite interesting. Talking of mud, yes, Ben did managed to find it.

It was really nice to meet up again, first time in 2.5 years. They had a little girl called Sine, pronounced Sheena, who was born two days before Jessica. She was such a well behaved sweet girl. We had our little Jessica, who bounded in with her big pink sunglasses, on upside down and her handbag and purse. She looked a right proper diva. She looked trouble all over.<\/p><p>Tobias was woken up, He was a sweetie at 10 months old. We played in the backgarden and turned the toy box upside down. We all played very nicely together. Sheena and Jessica took a while to warm to each other but played nicely towards the end. We had scrummy pizza. We spent over 2 hours there before moving on.<\/p><p>Quatre of an hour into the journey down to Doniford, Daddy had forgotton his wallet! Daddy told Mummy to ring Jessica to let her know. Mummy then goes, 'Oopie' as she had also forgotten her handbag which had the mobiles in it. We then proceeded to get hopelessly lost on our return. All a bit of a nightmare, but we eventually completed the 90 minute second leg of our journey.<\/p><p>We settled into our challet (sha-laaay) which was the nicest out of all our previous accomodations. We were quite impressed. We quickly caught the last part of a swimming session.<\/p><p>After unpacking, Daddy went to drive to the supermarket. Disaster, the car wouldn't start. Wouldn't even turn over. Electrics all OK. Had an argument because Mummy said she had renewed our breakdown cover, but hadn't and would cost an extra Â£90 to join up! Daddy, being tight refused to pay this. Thankfully after a couple of hours the car worked again.

Katie went on the 7-14 year old version. She did not enjoy it, because she could not see Daddy all of the time. This is becoming quite a handicap for her and limits her ability to join in many activities.<\/p><p>We played around in the water splash area, went around the mini lego countries before going on the tyre ride.

Mummy has always wanted to return back after a trip down here in her childhood. As it was quite a late decision there was quite a scamble to book ferry tickets, get a picnic and sort ourselves out. We made the 9:30 car ferry crossing. Farfar had gone by train and so caught a different boat across. It was quite funny because his Seacat overtook our slow, old boat. We could see each other waving.<\/p><p>We everntually all arrived (11am) at Robin Hill. The weather was fabulous, as Katie would say. First, we went on the train and pirate ship rides. There weren't many other people, so we got on first time. In fact we had 3 goes. The park was designed so you would follow a path around and after 50 yards or so there would be another attraction. There was a maze, mini village, plenty of adventure playgrounds, Troll Island and best of all a taboggen run. We barely fitted it all in. If only we had some more time. Katie and Ben said it was their best attraction park. Better than Thorpe Park, Chessington and Drayton Manor. The park was designed just right for them. It cost Â£33 for the 6 of us which was excellent value for money. It has persuaded us to maybe have our 2011 summer holiday on the Isle of Wight.<\/p><p>We left for our 4pm sailing back to the mainland. However, the boats were running an hour late we were told. So the boys and Katie went for a walk on to the jetty to splash our feet in the water. Half and hour later we got a phone call from Mummy to say she was on the boat that was currently docked. She'd been let on a boat half an hour earlier!  It meant the rest of us had to hurry and walk on to the boat. We were the last on, but thankfully made it in time. We had a good crossing back.

For some reason Uncle Michael vowed not to go on a Kayak with Daddy again. Not sure why. Anyway Daddy took Ben out to sea and over to the 'secret' beach and caves.

Without paying the Â£3.50 we saw nothing. So we promptly took the scenic route to Rhayader which was just fantastic.

A place where none of us hadn't been before. It was full of Indian and Banglideshi restaurants mainly. Restaurant after restaurant. Now here highlights Daddy's lack of Indian knowledge.

She could be real noisy.\u000a      <\/p><p>After looking west on the second walkway, we sunk down into the engine rooms, and sneaked some lunch in by the coal bunker! We departed Tower Bridge on the south side and caught a bus to Covent Garden. There was the inevitable street entertainer. He spent 10 minutes balanced on top of a ladder, to blow and pop a rubber glove on his head! It's all about the quality! We visited some knick-knack shops which were quite quaint. Katie has only a pair of canvas type shoes, which were soaked along with her tights. So we popped into an expensive camping shop and bought some boots and a pair of kids socks for Â£7.50.

Needless to say it was a tad busy in there. After looking around the toy department and queuing for the toilets, we went on the magical train journey to Lapland. It was presented really well and have been looking forward to the experience for the past week. After our short train ride, we were escorted by the lady elf into Father Christmas's grotto. He engaged with Katie and Ben straight away, by muddling their names up! Jessica on the other hand wasn't so sure. Anyway Katie wished for some necklacesâ and Ben some Star Wars'ez, as he says. We posed for some photos, before Father Christmas gave each of us a parting gift. A nice Christmas book each!<\/p><p>We exited and marched down to Marble Arch tube. Jessica put a smile on peopleâs hearts in the tube as she was laughing and smiling away and determined to wander around the carriage! We finally returned home, via the chip shop for a treat.

Barrie was getting a bit worried about his best man's speech. His parents were there as well, so it was good to catch up with them. We sat down for the wedding breakfast, late afternoon. Most of the 80 guests were of similar age so it was good to chat to some of Emma's college friends.<\/p><p>All the speeches were good.... even the Father of the Bride. Some English-Welsh jokes. James' speech was good... and he seemed to enjoy doing it. The opposite could be said for Bazza, obviously really nervous but the content was very good. He had to pull some of his Welsh jokes out in the end..... 'What's the best thing to come out of Wales?'...... 'The M4'!! Boom Boom.<\/p><p>We begun to drink and drink. Chocolate fountain and pork buffet. The disco was in full swing.... Again slightly different, there was a chap who sang all the songs. He was very good. The three brothers did some rock to the Motley Crew. They bounced around and pretended to play guitars. It was very funny.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2008\/2008_12_06-83-JamesEmmaWedding.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The Ball Crew' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The Ball Crew<\/p><p>The cake cutting was next... with Lightsabers.

Vicky split her dress.... and didn't we hear about it!<\/p><p>Midnight struck and before we turned back into pumpkins we returned back to the hotel on the coach. Everyone in good spirits. Anyway Daddy, a sleeping Barrie and James' Auntie Carol were the last men standing at 4am!<\/p><p>Some really nice touches at the wedding.

Ben was not feeling well and would not put his head in the bowl. We then drove to Ma Ma and Pop Pop's to go trick or treating or tickle and treating as Katie calls it. Ma Ma was running late (lost in Bournemouth) so we had to drag a reluctant pop Pop to come with us as Mummy wasn't sure whose doors to knock on. Ben wasn't into it as he was still feeling ill. we did about five houses and collected lots which made Ben perk up. Katie had a feather duster to tickle people as a trick but fortunately did not need to use it.<\/p><p>We arrived at Ma Ma and Pop Pop's house.

We had a spot of bother getting the minibus into a height restricted car park. A wheel spin and a bit of speed allowed us to scrape under the car park roof, leaving us with red paint etched on top! Oops.<\/p><p>A spruce up, and a trip to Frankie and Benny's for some nosh, we were now setup for the rest of the evening. A casino was first. Dog and Tony ended roughly even playing blackjack for a few hours, whilst the rest of us were trying to nurse Bazza through a friendly game of poker without him causing too much offense and noise! Oi Dunlop, come here! Snap Rules!! What?<\/p><p>Next in order was some Tino style walking towards the bars at the canal. After some had a Martini, we proceeded back to the hotel, for a cheeky chinky at 3am! Not all made it back in one piece, Mr Aves, lost his footing and got some almighty cuts and bruises all over his face.... or was it a mugging? Kingster?<\/p><p>Saturday:<\/p><p>Having scraped through the car park height restrictor on the way in, we had the same problem on the way out. We let some of the tyres down hoping to reduce the height, thus no scraping. However, it made no difference, and again we all cringed as we could hear the scraping noise as we departed the hotel for the quad biking. Martin Ball was convinced he had been at the quad biking venue before, but the organiser cast aspersions over that claim. James' and Emma's dads joined us.<\/p><p>On this bitterly cold morning, we had a small course to complete on a time trial basis. Some got it on two wheels within 10 seconds (huh erm), some aborted the bike by jumping off it (Dog), and some were obviously good at it. I think Duncan and Barrie were the top two candidates. A great laugh.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2008\/2008_11_01-24-JamesStag.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The Quad Biking Krew!' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The Quad Biking Krew!<\/p><p>We then descended to a local pub where we had some lunch and played some friendly poker.... and a final game for cash, which Tony walked away with the winnings.<\/p><p>At the business end of the stag do, we caught taxi's to the canal region again. Bazza leaning into one of the taxi's, saying \"it's ###### Bin Laden driving\" - welcome to our diplomat, Barrie! The cabbie just looked so disappointed! Anyway after the first establishment was ticked off, we hit Reflex, a 80's nightclub where James had to fulfil the dares on his t-shirt....which he managed to do.

After Ma Ma's hourly caffeine injection and a go on the swings, we set off again in the direction of Swanage. We got stuck in lots of holiday traffic and got slightly lost, but eventually found our lovely campsite. Auntie Karen, Uncle Richard, Jon and Rachel were leaving Swanage after their holiday and helped us put up our tents. We have a new one this year, fortunately easy to assemble, although not easy enough for us to do it! Auntie Karen and Uncle Richard lent us their Lillo and bedding for added comfort. Once we said goodbye to Pop Pop who had to drive all the way home, we went for a walk to the cliffs. However, the path soon became too steep for the buggy and the little ones, so we returned. We cooked sausages on our little stove and went to bed. In the night mummy was woken twice with Ben and Jessica being sick over our lovely new tent and sleeping bags!<\/p><p>Day 2 - Weymouth<\/p><p>We walked to a nearby swing park where Auntie Ellie mistakenly threw Lily over a wall, thinking there was a platform on the other side. Unfortunately there wasn't and she fell six foot to the ground. Luckily, she only cried for a minute and was fine, so we were able to laugh about it.<\/p><p>We then headed off to Weymouth where we lost each other and couldn't find anywhere to park. After communicating through Pop Pop we were able to find each other on the beach. We had a picnic, a play in the sand and were allowed two goes on the fair. After this we all want to go on a donkey, (so Ma Ma got on her hands and knees!)... Katie's was the biggest, and Ben a little baby one called Daisy. Next we caught an open topped bus to Portland Bill. At first it was great fun, but as the road became more open the wind was so intense, so we had to go downstairs. We had ice cream, but were unable to go up the lighthouse as you had to be a metre tall.<\/p><p>We desperately needed the laundrette to clean the sleeping bags and as luck would have it, we found one in Wareham on the way to the campsite, which stayed open till 9pm and had a chip shop next door, so we were able to have tea whilst we did our washing. Jessie was sick again in the night.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2008\/2008_08_26-14-SwanageHoliday-Weymouth.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Eee-ore' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Eee-ore<\/p><p>Day 3 - Farmer Parmers<\/p><p>We went for another go on the swings and then headed to Farmer Parmers. This was an excellent farm. We started by going in the play loft, and climbing haystacks and going down slides. There were tractors to ride, a great adventure playground and two huge bouncy castles. We hadn't found anywhere to buy a picnic, so decided to buy sausages there. In the afternoon we did the Woodland Walk, going over bridges and trying to spot Winnie The Pooh figures. We had a go in the Maize Maze and Katie and Ben got out first! The tractor ride was the bumpiest ever and verged on a white knuckle ride. We had an ice cream and Mummy was so busy trying to keep the wasps off Ben, she dropped hers without even having a bite. Finally there was some brilliant Go-Karts. The children too little to ride them, but they had seats on the back so the adults ride them around the bumpy track. We stopped at the Laundrette again and also bought a BBQ. At the campsite we cooked a delicious meal; sausages, burgers and marshmallows and also attempted a few campfire songs. Jessica was sick again!<\/p><p>Day 4 - Steam Train Ride<\/p><p>We caught the steam train, from Swanage to Corfe. Ben wet himself on the train after the guard pointed us in the wrong direction for the toilet and couldn't get there quick enough. He spent the rest of the day in Joey's swimming shorts. We found a little, old fashioned sweet shop in Corfe and were allowed sweets from Auntie Ellie's budget. Mummy had fun looking around Enid Blyton's shop. We didn't climb to the castle as we felt the little ones wouldn't make it, although Katie was desperate to try. Instead, we went into the model village and had great fun playing giant connect four, Jenga, hop scotch and croquet on a hill! One funny thing Katie and Joey found a little wishing well and put in a penny and made a wish. Katie started to cry because her wish hadn't come true. After eventually prizing out of her what it was, she said she wished to have found sweets in her pocket. Luckily, Mummy had some left from earlier and was able to convince Katie the fairy had put them in the wrong pocket. Katie was delighted. Then, Joey started crying as he wished for a motorbike and there was none in his pockets. Unfortunately none of the adults were able to produce a motorbike!<\/p><p>We caught the steam train back to Swanage and had a play on the beach. Katie and Mummy were brave enough to paddle up to our tummy's as it was quite cold. Jessie was not sick, thank goodness.<\/p><p>Day 5 - Studland Bay<\/p><p>We drove to Studland Bay. The weather was a little better, although still not hot. Ma Ma bought all the children a pair of Crocs (shoes), and we tried them out on the rocks looking for crabs. We didn't find any, however, people with special crab lines were catching loads, which fascinated us, using bacon as bait. Auntie Charlotte joined us, and made us boats in the sand. Katie and Mummy swum out to a boat. Auntie Ellie said we wouldn't able to, and lost the bet and was supposed to cook us bacon on the following day! Ben on the other hand screamed blue murder when mummy naughtily forced him into the sea, thinking he would enjoy it if he just got in there. We went for a walk along the cliff top and found an old fort. Katie and Joey had great fun playing in it.<\/p><p>We said goodbye to Ma Ma, who had to return home with Auntie Charlotte, and we went back to the campsite for our final night.<\/p><p>Day 6 - Littlehampton Beach Party<\/p><p>If we thought we couldn't fit anymore in to the car on the way to Swanage, on the way back we had the additional Lillo, two pillows, a double duvet and a wind break! We got so stressed trying to fit it all in, put the tents down and keep our eyes on the children. We set off in the direction of Littlehampton for Rachel's 30th birthday beach party. Four hours later we got there! We hadn't realized it would be such a long journey especially with all the holiday traffic we got stuck in. It was also a very hot day. However, the children were very well behaved in the car. We had great fun on the beach.<\/p><p>We had a BBQ and an ice cream. We went on Rachel's kayak and swum up to our necks in the sea again. We didn't leave Littlehampton until 6pm. We were helping one of Rachel's friends fly a kite. We ate a picnic tea on the way back to Auntie Ellie's where we stayed the night.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2008\/2008_08_30-14-SwanageHoliday-Littlehampton.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Kayak' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Kayak<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Weston Swanage Holiday"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":23,"m":8,"y":2008},"datev":20080823,"images":18,"info":{"content":"<p>Top 4 Roads<\/p><p>\u000a        1.\u000a        <a href=\"http:\/\/maps.live.com\/default.aspx?v=2&amp;FORM=LMLTCP&amp;cp=58.253172~-4.43985&amp;style=h&amp;lvl=9&amp;tilt=-90&amp;dir=0&amp;alt=-1000&amp;phx=0&amp;phy=0&amp;phscl=1&amp;rtp=pos.58.0240163952112_-4.40054945647717_Lairg%2C%20UK__~pos.58.476514030832_-4.41823185791253_Tongue%2C%20UK__&amp;rtop=0~0~0&amp;encType=1#JnJ0cD1wb3MudHAzbTI2Z216eXJ4X0xhaXJnJTJjK1VLX19fZV8lN2Vwb3MudHJjZzljZ215bXpiX1Rvbmd1ZSUyYytVS19fX2VfJTdlcG9zLnRyc3I1cmdwaHZ5OF9SZWF5JTJjK1VLX19fXyZydG9wPTAlN2Uw\">\u000a          Lairg To Tongue To Reay\u000a        <\/a>\u000a        - Single track road, little traffic, Ben Hope in the distance and Loch Loyal.

A convincing performance she gave as well. Showers curtailed our beaching experience so we sheltered and had our picnic. The big climb up the cliff which overlooked the beach was next. A great view of the coastline up there.<\/p><p>We then explored the rest of the town by car.... what a lovely town it was as well. A real shame that the weather put pay to more exploration, However, Katie and Mummy's managed a little trip to the tiny chapel at the end of the harbour.<\/p><p>Next stop were the sandy beaches of Woolacombe. We had great fun splashing in the puddles. Mummy and Katie braved it and went in to the sea, but then came running straight out again. Jessica on the other hand was trying to munch her way through the beach. Yes she loved eating sand! Despite the cool climate, we could have stayed there all day.<\/p><p>Just by chance in the ice cream parlour we sat next to Katie's class mate, Phoebe.

There we took part in some duck trailing, saw lambs being fed, watched three day old piglets jump around their mother, went on a tractor ride and train ride.

Katie on the other hand loved it and wanted to stay in there. Her swimming is really coming on. I think she actually managed to swim 10 meters without touching the bottom. It wasn't fluid mind you, but at least she is improving.<\/p><p>I think we were there for two hours. All but the driver slept on the way home. Just before dinner, Daddy tried Katie once more on the bike without the stabilizers. We had tried earlier in the year, but it really was hopeless. This time however, Katie managed to balance right away.  She just struggled a bit on the start, but she was so happy that she could join the rest of her friends in the 'I've got no stabilizers' group. Well done Katie.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2008\/2008_06_21-00-KatieNoStablelizers.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Girlie Ben and Cycling Katie' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Girlie Ben and Cycling Katie<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Katie on two wheels"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":19,"m":6,"y":2008},"datev":20080619,"first":{"name":"jessica","value":"Crawling forwards"},"info":{"content":"<p>Jessica has being moving around by rolling around the carpet up until now and half a pace backwards crawling.

The train set made an appearance surprisingly enough.<\/p><p>From there, all of us went over to Istead Rise for Iscot, to celebrate Ellie's impending 30th birthday.

Still a bit of a con. Nevertheless we saw Farfar in one of the pig pens again, and had our second tranche of swings!

So Daddy nervously wanted to go. You never know he might learn something. Daddy was going to see what actually goes on. When he asks Katie what she does, we always get an unenthusiastic response.<\/p><p>Daddy was the only father to turn up for the first part of day (9am). We played until the register was called. It was a bit embarrassing for Daddy as he seemed centre of attention, with children wanting to sit next to him and even cuddle him! There was a lot of things to get the children involved. Questions about today's weather, today's date, what we are currently learning, etc. I noticed that most pupils were eager to put their hands up to answer, however, Katie was a little tentative. When she reluctantly put her hand up for the 'day of the week' question, she answered correctly, Friday, however, when asked how she knew that she replied that it was a guess. Well at least she is honest.<\/p><p>One thing I could say very positively is that Katie was very attentive, sat still and focused on Miss King and what she said. Others had to be told subtlety to buck their ideas up.<\/p><p>The current topic was farm animals, in particular knowing an adult and child name of a species. We were all given a small card, with a picture and word of an animal. We then had to go around the class and ask for its older or younger counterpart. This was quite fun and we played this twice. Miss King then took a group of 4 or 5 and took them through some book work. The 15 others, could play in the classroom or just outside where there were many activities, from painting, playing the water pit, Lego, musical instruments, farms and computer work. I think in the half an hour we managed to get round all of these, including playing vets in the Wendy house. Some of Katie's friends followed Daddy around and try to steal him from Katie! I think it was daddy being silly and making pig noises won them over!<\/p><p>At 10:15 it was the school assembly. Each class took a line in the main hall and sat down. Mrs Allen, the headmistress, appears to know the names of all the pupils which is quite remarkable really, as she politely told some pupils to behave themselves. Anyway, after the healthy eating topic, she moved onto the Headmistress Awards. Two pupils from each class, each week get picked out for something good they have done. They pulled to the front of the assembly and asked about their work. Well today, it so happens that Katie was picked for her exceptionally improvement in her writing. She has been behind and something of a concern, but recently she has been able to form her letters a lot better now. It was nice to see some recognition for this. Anyway Daddy was very proud and Katie was beaming also. Well done Katie.<\/p><p>Before daddy had to rush back to work, him and Katie were picked out with a couple of others to have their photo taken for the Camberley News and Mail newspaper (in the end we made the front page!! See account on 24th June 2008). Not sure if they'll make it, but it was good to be picked. Must be because of the looks!<\/p><p>A really enjoyable time for Daddy. An insight in what goes on between 9am and 3pm.  From the little he saw, there is quite a lot of play and Katie needs her confidence building up when answering questions.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2008\/2008_06_13-05-MartinToSchoolKatie.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='School Pals' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>School Pals<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Daddy Goes To School"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":9,"m":6,"y":2008},"datev":20080609,"images":1,"info":{"content":"<p>The girls and Ben went to church while the boys stayed at home to build the trampoline and see saw Ma Ma had bought.

Katie and Ben were interested up to a point, but were easily distracted by things, like going to the toilet multiple times! Ben is currently back in his 'big boy pants' with more success than previously. Out of the six widdles, four were successful and two times he forgot! Still it is progress and at least worth pursuing.\u000a      <\/p><p>\u000a        We sat and ate our picnic, then went over to see the animal rescue team which had some serious, but funny photo's of animals being stuck.

The kiwi man sheared a sheep first, then managed to get some of the sheep to dance. He was very amusing. Next door in complete contrast, was a disorganised family who ran the ferret racing. The man on the microphone went off on tangents and really no one was listening to him. Anyway, I'm glad to say that all three children were brave enough to stroke the animal before they raced, which is more than can be said for their mother! The race itself was very funny, with the ferrets going one way then another. Ben is a very, very poor loser. His ferret did not win and he got in an almighty strop because of this.\u000a      <\/p><p>Next stop was the army, inflatable assault course which Katie won easily, twice! There was a staged horse chasing show, then the sheep man was back again, this time with a sheep race which again was funny. Overall a very nice event. Not too packed, not too expensive. Just right. We saw one of Daddy's old football chums and we also managed to bump into the West family who were enjoying an ice cream.<\/p><p>\u000a        We moved a mile down the road to see if we could catch the last of the banger racing.

Anyway we sneaked in to watch the final three races, hoping that we may be able to go more regularly as a family. The bangers were a bit thin on the ground, but there were plenty of stock cars. We saw a few crashes and the smell of oil and rubber and the sound of metal scraping on tarmac were all reminiscent of days gone past. Anyway Ben seemed to enjoy it, but Katie was more interested in playing in the dust. The family looked a right mess, with chocolate ice cream around their chops and half their picnic down their clothes. This was about par for the course in the surroundings.

There were plenty of lovely fish, meat and fruit stalls as well as fake footwear and dodgy mobile phone fixers. We quickly moved on and walked a long way to London Fields where we surprisingly saw a lido that was open and with people swimming.

It looked nice and clean and certainly one for the summer, especially as there is free parking nearby.<\/p><p>We were getting a bit tired and hungry so we de-camped at the swings for a bite to eat. There was one of those rope, pyramid apparatus that rises about 10 metres up. Well whilst Katie and Daddy were on it a little girl, slipped and fell down from near the top. It's one of those heart in the mouth times.

We dreamed of having some money to actually buy some bits, but we passed and moved on over the Regent's canal down to Haggerston Park where Katie and Ben had a run around the bmx track. There was a child no older than two that was on a 'running bike', like Joey's, who managed to go down the hills at great pace with no help. He balanced himself. I thought it was a neat bike to promote balance. Better than stabilizers.\u000a      <\/p><p><a href=\"www.hackneycityfarm.co.uk\/\">Hackney City Farm<\/a>was next door where we saw Farfar wallowing around in the mud!

Ah ha this must be the torture chamber!<\/p><p>The surgeon told me to lie down. He was first quite brutal in getting everything into position and then whilst casually chatting a needle was injected somewhere down below. It makes me wince just writing it now. Arrgghhh. The pain was pretty severe and I must admit I did make a groaning noise. I also immediately jerked my knee up as a natural reaction. The surgeon asked me to not to do that as it was \"jogging his steady hand\"! Probably the last person you would want to jog! I thought of saying you try and lie here and have someone inject your bits. I could feel whatever fluids being inserted entering my system which wasn't a pleasant feeling either.<\/p><p>The procedure continued. By this time I didn't know whether to be tense, as the slightest move brought some pain, or whether to relax to give my heart a chance to slow down! For 90% of the time I braced myself whilst trying to make polite conversation!  Anyway, I couldn't feel the actual fusing of the tubes. All I could hear was a buzz now and again, sounding like a loose electrical connection. This I presume was the burning\/fusing part.<\/p><p>Then all of a sudden. BAM. Another injection equally as painful as the first and totally unexpected. Another hit. I assume it was one for each testicle.

I went to meet them at the airport but couldn't find them! We eventually met up at the hotel and proceeded to go with Ma Ma and Pop Pop out to Banna beach where I decided to change and run into the cold sea. It was great as the waves were reasonably big to jump into. It wasn't cold once I swum around a bit. Ben loved running in and out of the water until he fell over in it and got soaking wet!\u000a        <\/li><\/ul><img src='images\/years\/2007\/2007_07_07-24-JoyceSteveWedding.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Fancy a swim at Banna Beach?' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Fancy a swim at Banna Beach?<\/p><ul><li>We returned back to the hotel to freshen up and get changed. There were two busses to take the guests to the church which was in a place called Camp. The church was at the foot of the Slieve Mish Mountains, looking back across the bay of Tralee. The service was not so much as a couple of sides of paper, but more like a book! True to form the kiddies made life a little awkward. Katie needed a wee, so I took her outside into the bushes. She then proceeded to wee on her 'pretty shoes' and my hand, this all happening as Joyce was pulling up in the car. I was wiping my hands and Katie's foot out in the hallway where Joyce was waiting to make an entrance. Sorry Joyce..... Oh and she looked beautiful in her dress. I quickly nipped in and positioned ourselves back to normal. Then, as Joyce walked down the aisle Ben was standing on the pew and you could see on his face he was straining himself. The bowling lot behind us were going 'Pooey' and 'Whatâs that smell?' in jest. Anyway it was time for me to take him out and change his nappy. I knew keeping Ben in church would be like locking up a caged animal, so we went for a walk up the hill and saw the stream, some sheep and horses who chased us off. Not that I was scared! We returned for the last five minutes. Laura said it was a really romantic service, one I am gutted to have missed.<\/li><\/ul><img src='images\/years\/2007\/2007_07_07-99-JoyceSteveWedding.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The happy couple' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The happy couple<\/p><ul><li>We returned to the hotel. Laura and I were busy chasing the kiddies all over the place as photos were taken. We had a lovely chocolate fountain to distract us and proceeded to fill our faces.<\/li><li>Photos were taken and kids were there to be followed and chased around the corridors of the lovely hotel. We sat on a big round table with Ellie, Charlotte and the Allenâs'. The food was plentiful and nice. Martin Bigg's best mans speech is probably the best I've heard.<\/li><li>The evening went on with the boys getting on with the Irish lot. Laura and I took it in turns to go and mind the sleeping children. Unfortunately the dancing started too late for them. Katie was still going at 9pm, fit and strong, having been up since 3am! She's got Ma Ma's energy that is for sure. Barrie got drunk quite early and fell asleep first on the toilet and then in the hallway. He ended up drinking water for the rest of the night. Charlotte ended up in the boys room (but nothing happened), Nick was a hit with the Irish ladies, Howard was matched up by Ma Ma with a Tralee'n and Paul Deer offended some of the Irish with an off the cuff remark meant in jest! The party went long into the night.

It included cheese on toast topped with marmalade, an interesting combination which I liked and Howard didn't. We had to move quick as the builders were in and ready to go. One had parked his truck such that the cradle was hanging above Howardâs bike! We headed out of Skibbereen and instantly began to ride on empty, windy roads viewing mountains and the coast. I had my Feeder mp3's on, the weather was good, motorcycling conditions were good and the scenery breath taking. It's very hard to describe and even the photos don't do it any justice. You've just got to do it yourself. Needless to say we seemingly stopped every five minutes to marvel at the views. It seemed we'd stop and see something we liked, go on a bit, go around a corner then another hidden treasure is presented, stop again to marvel take some photos and go on again. This morning was probably the best bit of the trip for me.\u000a        <\/li><li>The roads were rough though! We kept seeing road works signs, then a '100' sign.... which I think meant 100 pot holes per kilometre!

The gateway to the much heralded Ring Of Kerry. To begin with I must admit I wasn't that impressed, especially from what I had seen in the morning. The roads were certainly a lot busier with tourists and construction traffic. As we started to reach the west half of the peninsula the scenery again got more dramatic, looking across at the mountains. Small sandy beaches would pop up around the next corner. I liked seeing the small, green hilled islands poking out of the Atlantic Ocean and the waves crashing into the rocks. We stopped a number of times, but quickly pushed on after lunch which we had in a friendly Irish coffee shop. We headed for Sue and Richardâs cottage which we were going to stay at overnight at Boolteens.<\/li><li>It was in a beautiful location. Views of Slieve Mish Mountains out the back window and Dingle Bay out the front. Again difficult to describe really, but somewhere you'd want to retire to. We dumped our stuff and had a cup of tea before we parted ways. Richard and Sue went off to Tralee whilst we had the Dingle peninsula to explore. First stop was Inch beach, then onto Dingle itself. A busy town, again with old, colourful buildings. It's naughty to say this, but we didn't stop because we have had seen the same over the past couple of days.<\/li><li>Out west past Dingle we probably saw the most stunning scenery. We were biking along the cliff edge. The sea looked so blue. We stopped a number of times. On one stop I went into the top box to get the map only to find my pineapple flavoured smoothie decided to leak covering the shoes I am supposed to wear at the wedding and Howard's sat nav, which proceeded to no longer work! I couldn't even throw stuff away or clean up. Arrgghh. Anyway we laughed.<\/li><\/ul><img src='images\/years\/2007\/2007_07_06-89-Kerry.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The holy one' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The holy one<\/p><ul><li>Heading out of the Dingle peninsula my back wheel flicked a stone, which hit and oncoming car on the driverâs door which dented it nicely. The stone then bounces back and almost hits Howard on the rebound who is following me! Anyway I was proud to have reached 100mph on Dingle! Don't tell Laura.<\/li><li>We scrubbed up at the cottage and then biked to Tralee to meet with the other wedding guests in the hotel. It was nice to meet up with familiar faces. There must have been about 30 of Steve's friends and family.

A chance to enjoy the Irish countryside. Well not really the weather was so bad we couldn't see much and had to concentrate a lot on the road. We hit New Ross, got lost in Waterford and then went on to Cork. All the towns looked quite similar in that there weren't any modern buildings, most of them painted colourfully, shot fronts were artistically decorated and the road surface shot to buggery! No need for speed humps.\u000a        <\/li><li>By the time we got to Cork it had stopped raining and we walked down some of the pedestrianized streets and stopped off in a coffee shop for a nice round of sarnies and a hot drink. It was refreshing to walk where not every other shop was not part of a chain. Howard bought some 'tack' from the tourist information and we headed into the suggested deep, south west corner of Ireland.<\/li><li>Next stop was Clonakilty which was walked around for a bit. It had the same character and appearance as all the towns we had passed so far. Narrow streets, colourful, old-ish buildings. We weren't impressed with Clonakilty Bay, it looked like a swamp! We didn't know where we were going. Just heading in a general westward direction along the coast. We hit our first 'Wow' scene at Inchydoney Beach. A massive white, sandy beach with hills and cliffs either side. We stopped for some photos and continued along the dramatic coastline. It was nice to get out of the towns and off the main roads. I was really enjoying myself seeing the sites and riding with Howard.<\/li><li>Late afternoon we decided to base ourselves at Skibbereen. We tried a number of B and B's along the high street before the one that won 'Most Unusual B and B in Ireland' had a free room. That was because no one else actually would stay there! It was a place Laura would have run a mile from. It was set in a Victorian style, the deep red walls were filled with many artefacts like nude paintings, a stuffed bird and a certificate where the proprietor, Mona, had bought a Scottish title. There were dusty mannequins dressed in evening wear in the hall way. Mona showed us our room and enquired if we wanted a double or two twins! The bathroom across the hall was very different. It had deep red carpets, a massive corner bath, a bidet, a chez lounge and all Mona's toiletries it seemed. I couldn't stop chuckling to myself at how weird it all was. It was an experience. As I say Laura would have run a mile from this place.<\/li><li>We decided to do a couple more short excursions to Baltimore and Castletownsend. The sea was certainly still very choppy. Waves crashing over the harbour walls. We were nice and warm in our bike gear. We kept commenting on how this would be packed with tourists in the summer season when the weather was warmer and better... but of course we were already in July.<\/li><\/ul><img src='images\/years\/2007\/2007_07_05-23-WestCork.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Ship Wreck' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Ship Wreck<\/p><ul><li>We headed back into Skibbereen and had some fare in a pub. Ear wigging some locals conversation I found it difficult to comprehend what they were saying, their accent was something out of the film Snatch! The talk of the town was the recent drugs found washed up at a local village. 100 million pounds worth! There were quite a few pubs, but not many had more than half a dozen people in them. We finally parked ourselves in a place which had a bit of atmosphere and later a band. Howard had his first ever pint of Guinness at the age of 50! He thought it was alright.<\/li><\/ul>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Motorbike Ireland Tour - Rosslare, Cork, Skibbereen"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":4,"m":7,"y":2007},"datev":20070704,"images":1,"info":{"content":"<ul><li><i>Daddy's Bike Touring<\/i>Lauraâs Uncle Howard and I had planned a motor biking trip around Steven and Joyceâs wedding.

Howard came around and we set off in changeable weather conditions. Conditions ranged from rain, to being sunny, but worst of all it was pretty windy. At times we had to slow right down as the wind was trying to blow us into the next motorway lane! We stopped off at Penarth services thinking we were almost there. I mean itâs a long way down the M4 isnât it? However, we still had about 100 miles to go and we were struggling for time as the M4 petered out and the roads narrowed. This was a proper biking trip, weaving in and out of traffic at speeds higher than I would say was comfortable. We just made the boat in time, being last on. As one of the crew was strapping the bike down he noticed a pool of blue liquid under my bike! Oh no.

Well the first 15 minutes were fine. The next quatre of an hour the mood changed as the Sea Cat bounced up and down over the waves. The waves were splashing up on the sides of the windows. Passengersâ faces started to turn green, merchandise from the shop was falling off shelves and you could do comedy walks as we were treated to going up and down, up and down. The half an hour marker saw the first sick bags being used. I remarkably lasted till 45 minutes before the strawberry smoothie I had in port re-appeared! I felt better for it, but felt ever so sleepy and still a bit queasy. âIron Gutâ Howard wasn't feeling the best.<\/li><li>Thank goodness the journey was just two hours and we arrived in Rosslare to a lovely sunset.

Oh well we made it to Gatwick in time and the check in process all went quite smoothly. Not much queuing at all.<\/p><p>Daddy and Farmor were going to see Oldemor to help celebrate her 90th birthday. It was a cloudy day so grabbing a window seat only proved an advantage for about 20 seconds before we were immersed in cotton wool. The plane was just half full. Farmor had sneaked on a cheese sandwich to eat as we weren't going to pay extortionate prices for 'cardboard and fruit'.<\/p><p>Arriving at the airport we stepped out to a fine, sunny day. We made our way to Kongens Nytorv and the classy Magasin department store. We reached the top floor, secured a window seat and watched over the circulating ice skaters as we delicately scoffed smorbrÃ¸d and a tiny Ã¸l (well a pint of Tuborg).<\/p><p>We Metroâed, trained and bussed our way to see Oldemor at her home about 10 miles outside Copenhagen.<\/p><p>Oldemor was in fine spirits and sat chirping away. She still appears vacant at times, but the pleasing thing is that she still has a sense of humour and is well. The same revolving, small talk questions were answered in the same patient manner. Oldemor's daily schedule is, breakfast, then a midday lunch, followed by a sleep from 1pm to 3pm, then dinner at 6pm and bedtime at 7 or 8 o'clock. She has a number of pills, one for sedation, another for her heart and a number of vitamin and iron supplements.<\/p><p>It was nice for the 3 of us to sit together in her front room decorated with pictures of the English contingent and her old furniture. We had some coffee and of course Oldemor was dishing out the sweets and taking a few for herself. We read and chatted until 6pm when it was 'liver stew' time. :(<\/p><p>Farmor and Daddy joined in with this meal. It was pretty quiet amongst the 15 or so inmates. Some seemed very able to get about and knew what they were doing. The 100 year old looked remarkable and was helping some of her younger comrades from their seats. There was a married couple both in wheelchairs which was very sweet. Somehow I can't imagine Laura and I ever being in a home together in later years. I think we will have argued ourselves to our coffins before we get to that stage!<\/p><p>Wishing Oldemor a good night, Farmor and Daddy went off to the city centre to 'paint the town red'. Rip it up so to speak. Well it was blooming cold, at -3 degrees, with a stiff wind. After exploring the cinema we decided to head for a bar and have an expensive drink. It still amazes me how quiet the city is. Where is everyone? What are they doing? We returned home to have some pastries and a catch up of the news on BBC World, before settling down to the World Service for the night!<\/p><p>Daddy went to Denmark so Auntie Charlotte came to stay as mummy doesn't like being on her own in the house. We went to Poppy's birthday party at Fizzy Kids then on to see Great Grandma and Grandad. In the evening Auntie Charlotte had a party so we went to stay at Auntie Ellie's. We all had a great time. Pizza for tea, then a play and then all in the bath together (not Lilly though). Mummy put Katie and Ben to bed in Auntie Ellie's bed but when she went to get Ben to put him in the travel cot she couldn't find him in the bed or on the floor. She panicked of course but found him snuggled up asleep in the corner of the bedroom, Mummy doesn't know how he got there!

Was a little shy to begin with but soon settled in and started to have fun.

We loved it and we want someone to make me one for my garden!!!! Ma Ma would not come on the softplay because she had a skirt on (so what I ask?) I think she was silly to wear a skirt anyway. Soon it was time to leave and we set off for Pop Pop's favourite place on earth - Bluewater.<\/li><li>As we arrived I gave Ma Ma a sly look and said \"Can I have another pair of shoes?\" (Last time we came I got a pair) Of course she said yes, as I knew she would. However, once inside the Mall I spotted some fantastic balloons. I couldn't believe it because when I asked if I could have one Ma Ma said it had to be either the shoes OR the balloon - I ask you how mean is that! Anyway I chose the balloon.<\/li><li>We had a spot of lunch (I had crisps hee hee) and then went down to the stable where Ma Ma rides each week. Tikki is lovely and I got to ride her round the stable yard with Ma Ma. I was so brave I even brushed her. While Ma Ma rode, Pop Pop and I went To Toys R Us  where I played with all the toys (what a surprise!). Once we were back at Ma Ma and Pop Pop's we played loads of games and had tea (sausages and baked beans for me - yum) and then after watching \"You've Been framed\" and reading a few books I went to bed.

It was so, so much easier and quieter handling just one of our offspring and we had the energy and time to muck around with him properly. What a difference there is between having one and two children to look after.

Monday we were officially bought out by Bottomline Technologies, a Nasdaq, American competitor. It was mentioned that up to 20 members of staff in the UK were to be made redundant. Quite a high figure as there were only 60 odd employees. Of course I was worried, but we in development thought we wouldn't be hit to hard! How wrong we were, as we were announced into Tuesday that 10 in our room were to go, 3 of which from Development!<\/p><p>Wednesday and Thursday were spent deliberating who was to go.... and this was a terrible time. Kind of akin to waiting to see if you were going to be hanged or not. I guessed I was in the bottom 4 and giving myself a %25 chance of staying. However, the wait was agonising and I couldn't work \/ think. Mentally draining. Because of UK law, management couldn't just choose someone and march them out like in the US, we had to be given reasons for redundancy and a scoring criteria was set out marking each individual in 30 different areas of the job.<\/p><p>David Winkworth was first to go on Thursday night and as soon as I knew that, my chance diminished to 99% chance of ending my days.<\/p><p>Funnily enough, I came to terms with this within an hour or so on Thursday night and felt happy as the pressure was off.<\/p><p>However, my mood turned into sadness on Friday morning as I waited and waited to get my cards. Just couldn't handle it. I was finally called into a room with Debbie and Darren and given the news.<\/p><p>My redundancy terms were<\/p><ul><li><i>Consultancy Period<\/i>1 week\u000a        <\/li><li><i>Notice<\/i>9 weeks (1 week for every year worked)\u000a        <\/li><li><i>Holiday owing<\/i>1 week\u000a        <\/li><li><i>Redundancy<\/i>9 weeks (1 week for every year worked - not taxable)\u000a        <\/li><\/ul><p>Overall I reckon I will be given between 5 and 6 months normal pay. This is a great relief and may end quite beneficial for us.<\/p><p>Did I agree I should go? Well maybe, maybe not. I agree I am the worst probably technically out of the 9. However, I can't believe that I am in the bottom 3 for personality traits or product knowledge. Anyway I have accepted the decision and not looking forward to the job seeking process, but I am looking forward to a fresh environment and challenge.<\/p><p>As part of my preparation for getting a job I need to obviously get a CV written. Currently I have nothing. Also, and maybe more importantly I need to gem up in quite a few areas in order to impress an interviewer and maybe more importantly get my confidence levels a lot higher, as currently I don't feel great.<\/p><p>On Wednesday the share money from the buy-out hit our account which equated to the equivalent of another 6 monthsâ salary. So not all bad at the end of the day. For me to get on with my career, I needed to leave FormScape, and the only way that was going to happen was for something like this. So I guess I am trying to say this can be seen as a blessing in disguise...... just hope it doesn't turn into a nightmare.<\/p><p>I would like to think that I get a number of interviews before Christmas.

Ben is still not 100% comfortable with the water just yet. He looks so shocked when water splashes his face, even though he's used it in the bath.

Mmmm. Cheapest we could find.<\/p><p>We went to Reuilly swimming pool which we had seen the day before..... What we hadn't seen is the notice to say as from today that it was closed for renovation work!! Arrgghh. So Daddy with his Del Boy French managed to ask a non-English speaking local where the nearest swimming pool was. Mummy got the directions all wrong. She muddled âTout Droitâ with âA Droitâ. Anyway the route took us an extra mile or so along the viaduct garden route all the way to where the ring road circles Paris! By this stage we were a little demoralized at all of the travelling to find a sodding swimming pool.<\/p><p>\u000a        We arrived to find that this was an<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnparis.net\/\">outdoor pool<\/a>for professional swimmers !! Still after our hot dog lunch, Katie and Daddy ventured in. The pool was laned off with 40 or so people go up and down, up and down. We phaffed around to find swimming caps and eventually made it in to the warm pool. Katie loved in there and we managed to do 2 lengths without out too much help. Daddy is a bit worried about Katie's lack of swimming skills so he always barks out kick, kick, kick and arms out like a butterfly. We're not sure if she has got it yet.\u000a      <\/p><p>We were in there for 45 minutes and got out at 1pm. We were now in a rush to get to the train station in time.... We also had to cross Paris to the hotel in order to get our suitcases. In the end Daddy rushed back to the hotel, whilst the rest of us went to check in at Gard Du Nord. We re-united with Daddy in the departure lounge, when Mummy had realized that she had left the rucksack with the metal detector people.... Anyway passports were taken as the second potential security incident occurred (1st when we left pushchair under the Eiffel Tower unattended for an hour or so).<\/p><p>The train journey home was a sad one as we had really enjoyed our holiday. Again we only had 2 seats for the four of us.<\/p><p>In the train Mummy was hungry and wanted to know if she could eat a bit of Katie:<\/p><ul><li><i>Mummy<\/i>Can I eat one of your arms. You only need one.\u000a        <\/li><li><i>Katie<\/i>No I need my arms\u000a        <\/li><li><i>Mummy<\/i>Can I have one of your ears?\u000a        <\/li><li><i>Katie<\/i>No I need I need my ears to hear\u000a        <\/li><li><i>Mummy<\/i>Can I eat your nose?\u000a        <\/li><li><i>Katie<\/i>No I need my nose\u000a        <\/li><li><i>Mummy<\/i>Why do you need your nose?\u000a        <\/li><li><i>Mummy<\/i>For picking!!\u000a        <\/li><\/ul><p>We made it back on time in to Waterloo where we got a train back to Woking where Farmor and Farfar came to pick us up.

There were tons of police around and they had shut the road. The art museum, Musee du Quai Branly was opened by President Jacques Chirac and Kofi Annan. Anyway it didn't really interest us and we brisked passed on to Tour De Eiffel.<\/p><p>We didn't quite know what to do with the pushchair so decided just to dump it under the tower. At this time of the morning there were not that many people about. We went to the cleanest toilets in Paris as Benny the pooing machine had again filled his nappy. We queued in the longest queue and paid to go up in the lifts, then found where you can walk up the first two levels.<\/p><p>Daddy walked up the first two flights, with Ben on his shoulders. You could see quite a lot of Paris from here. Katie spotted some carrouselâs which we had to keep looking out for at each level we reached. The views were great views across the city.

As the lift rose, Mummy and Daddy's knees began to wobble a bit. It wasn't a pleasant journey as the structure thinned out towards the top. The lifts don't go up vertically, they are at a slight angel due to the  shape of the tower. We finally hit the top and looked around in the inside gallery. Then we climbed some more steps and went to the outside viewing gallery. Mummy and Daddy were a bit uncomfortable especially when Katie was leaning against the railings. Still you could see even more from up here. We didn't spend long up there and got the lift back to level 2 and walked down all the steps to the bottom.<\/p><p>We went to look for the pushchair and noticed it had gone! Oh dear. The police had removed it, so Daddy went to get it! Woops. We know nobody would have stolen it. It was in such a state. Food stains all over it.<\/p><p>We went to the nearby play ground, then had our picnic in the park next to the Eiffel Tower. We were constantly hassled by these so called Bosnian girls who were basically begging. In the end we had to tell them to go away, almost pinching the yoghurt we were feeding Ben with out of our hands. They were clean and had clean clothes on so I wasn't falling for it. Come to think of it, there were quite a lot of beggars throughout our holiday. So you could see were genuinely homeless, most were con-artists.<\/p><p>Katie wanted to go on the carrouselâs that we saw from the tower. So we had a go on 2 of them! Even Benny Boo had a go. We walked to the Trocadero and got some pictures of us in front of the Eiffel Tower.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2006\/2006_06_20-44-EiffelTower.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Eiffel Tower' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Eiffel Tower<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2006\/2006_06_20-40-EiffelTower.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='On the carrousel' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>On the carrousel<\/p><p>\u000a        We walked eastwards back along the Seine to Place De La Resistance (just had to write that as that is Del Boy sating I think). Anyway there was the sewer museum there (\u000a        <a href=\"http:\/\/europeforvisitors.com\/paris\/articles\/paris-sewers-museum.htm\">\u000a          Le Musee des Egouts\u000a        <\/a>\u000a        ). We got down there and Katie took some water from the bottle and was told she wasn't allowed to drink it for risk of the bacteria attacking it! Comforting to know! Anyway we walked through the tunnels and saw the sewage gushing past. Mummy thought it smelt bad. Daddy didn't mind it. We walked around in about half an hour and rose to some fresh air.\u000a      <\/p><p>Continuing eastwards we saw the impressive Musee de l'Armee building by Invalides.<\/p><p>Next northwards on the Metro to Moulin Rouge. Not that impressed with it, especially as it seemed to be in a bit of a seedy area. We had a quick peek inside the reception area, then took a long walk back to the hotel over Monmartre hill<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2006\/2006_06_20-48-EiffelTower.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Moulin Rouge' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Moulin Rouge<\/p><p>We cleaned ourselves up at the hotel and bussed it to Place De Clichy where we had earlier seen the Hippo restaurant. We try to keep it cheap, as we were on a budge. Daddy decided not to eat, and we thought that Katie's meal wouldn't come with chips. Alas, Mummy's burger was well done, but not well done enough so Daddy had to eat it (which turned out to be a Horse burger anyway), and Mummy went without. Katie's meal turned up with a large plate of chips. Ben on the other hand was impressing one of the young lady waitresses. Impressed so much she wrote her name and phone number on a bit of card and gave it to her! Good work Benny boy. A chip off the old block. Let the ladies do the chasing. It all ended embarrassingly as the other waitresses laughed at how little money was spent.<\/p><p>We crawled into bed quite late in the end. Mummy and Daddy stayed up to watch England draw disappointingly with Sweden 2-2, with the sound muted!... and Mummy muted!<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Eiffel Tower - Sewer Museum - Moulin Rouge"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":19,"m":6,"y":2006},"datev":20060619,"images":2,"info":{"content":"<p>We got up normal time, embarrassingly had breakfast with a naughty Katie and headed on the metro to the Zoo. On the way Daddy had lost the wallet. Panic set in for about a minute when the guard came running down the stair to find me! Phew.<\/p><p>The metro at 9am on a Monday morning going into the city was surprisingly quiet. Also the Parisians need to be introduced to escalators in their underground system! Not fun carrying the double buggy around.<\/p><p>Daddy also boobed when we got off the train. He went through the automatic gates to drop the bag and Ben off and then couldn't go back to get the pushchair. Eventually he worked out where the motion sensors were and climbed-jumped over to get the pushchair.<\/p><p>The zoo was a small stroll away, slightly out of the city. We could see the man made mountain a long way away and we were getting excited as to what we were going to encounter.<\/p><p>It cost just Â£6 for us all to get in..... Absolute bargain. Tight Daddy almost fell over in amazement to how cheap it was. However, there was a reason to the cheapness! There were hardly any bloody animal there!<\/p><p>The place reminded us of London Zoo. Old 60's style under a lot of renovation work because of it. And because of it there were no animals. we couldn't even go up the mountain to see the views. It was quite depressing really, especially as the animals that were there didn't seemed to be kept to English high standards! There were some goats stuck half way up a mountain!! (because they were mountain goats)... Seriously the one and only huge Sea Lion had funny teeth and was on his own. One seal just wouldn't get up even though it was feeding time.... It was like the Rab C Nesbitt of the seal world. The penguins had their water moat drained... and the hippo was just showing us his bottom (reminded me of Dawg) as he was munching his grass<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2006\/2006_06_19-20-NotreDam.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Chatty old lady' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Chatty old lady<\/p><p>We departed within 2 hours and headed to the nearby park to eat our lunch. Katie needed the toilet, so Daddy helped squat her by a tree. Daddy's arm and leg got wet! Having to think what to do next, Mummy and Daddy thought of going to see the Notre Damm.<\/p><p>Taking the metro we all got in except for Daddy who had to take another carriage because of the buggy. We sailed off, leaving Daddy standing. Now it is one of those situations: Do we get off next stop, Do we get off and go back, or do we just go to where Daddy said we needed to go. We took the last of those options, and thankfully we met up again at Strasbourg St Denis. That was a bit of luck as Daddy had all the bags, money and tickets. This was doubly important as Ben Hiroshimaâed.<\/p><p>Daddy took Ben into McDonalds to get his nappy changed. However, there was no baby change facility which made things very tricky for the useless Daddy. Anyway when they came out, fair enough Ben nappy was changed, but he still had poo on his trousers and poo all over Daddy's t-shirt! Pooo-ey. Katie really didn't want to be near Daddy now.<\/p><p>We decided to walk from here down to 'City'. Daddy's nightmare day continued as he led us all down what seemed the fat ladyâs, red light district. If you liked them fat or old then this street was for you. It was an eye opener for Mummy and Daddy, we were oblivious to what was going on. We walked and walked until we found a map and we weren't quite going in the direction we hoped. We entered the pedestrianized, shopping area and eventually a park with a childrenâs garden and men playing boules.<\/p><p>We crossed the Seine, Katie had an ice cream, Daddy pointed out the Eiffel Tower to mummy, who claimed 'I wasn't expecting it to look like that. I thought it was a gold building!!'.... I know it beggars beyond belief at the lack of knowledge mummy has! Anyway we finally hit the Notre Damm. We piled inside with the hundreds of others. Farfar can't go inside because he has a 'thing' about tall ceilings... Well you can't argue against that. It was very high up. We done a lap and was amazed at all the stained glass windows. We tried to go up on to the roof but the queue for that was far too long.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2006\/2006_06_19-23-NotreDam.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Chatty old lady' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Chatty old lady<\/p><p>So we decided to eat. Mummy insisted that Katie would only eat chips. Daddy refused to accept that and ate a baguette thingy and Mummy and Katie had a McDonalds!<\/p><p>We caught the Metro from Chatelet and walked back to the Hotel. Katie was shattered.

However, Mummy thought we were going to Lille for 1 night, instead Daddy had planned Paris for four. It was Daddy's intention to see how long he could leave it before letting Mummy that we were not staying in Lille for 1 night.<\/p><p>We left Waterloo still not at our seats as Daddy got us on the wrong carriage. We finally bundled in our two seats for 4 people! The plan was that as we had kept Ben awake all this time that he was at least to go to sleep. Nope! Little Man didn't want any of it. Katie bored and Ben tired and not wanting to go to sleep made our journey a long one.... and for Daddy one spent in the luxury of by the toilets as to not upset any of the other passengers.<\/p><p>We quickly raced passed Gillingham bridge and soon entered the tunnel. Katie had kept re-iterating how she didn't want to go through the tunnel.... But it passed without much comment.<\/p><p>We soon arrived at Lille and Mummy still was none the wiser. We started to get off, then Daddy mentioned that he couldn't be bother and that we might as well stay on to Paris. Woo Hoo. Mummy was happy and sad. Obviously happy to be going to Paris. Sad to have to entertain us for another hour! At least Ben slept for part of this.... It was a shame as we didn't get much opportunity to see any of the countryside really.<\/p><p>The heat hit us as we stepped outside the air conditioned train. We eventually got our Paris Visite tickets (Â£40 for 5 days for 2 adults, Kids - Free) and lugged our luggage out of station, to find bus 31. It was quite comical Mummy taking us and seeing Daddy struggle getting 2 suitcases, a rucksack and the double buggy on and off the bus. It only took 10 minutes to get to the hotel which looked from the outside. It was the Hotel Eden, Montmartre.<\/p><p>We checked in and made our way up to the fifth floor in the smallest lift in the world (fits 4 people at a squash), into a small triple room. Saying that it had a nice bathroom, a great view from the balcony and the staff were helpful.<\/p><p>By now it was late afternoon, so we unpacked and made our way to SacrÃ© Coeur. Daddy told Mummy that we were going to stay a little longer than 1 night, which Mummy was relived about. All this effort and all this way for just 24 hours in Paris! Non.<\/p><p>SacrÃ© Coeur was some cathedral at the top of Monmartre Hill. Anyway that is what we thought. It was a really nice walk. As begun climbing the million or so steps some old German-French lady spoke to us.... Well Mummy anyway. She kept repeating herself like old people do. She was very sweet saying that. After about 10 minutes we managed to free ourselves to continue the climb. The views behind us were terrific. Katie loved climbing all those steps. She was in her element. Ben was just smiling at all the ladies. Daddy and Ben make a great team with the ladies. Ben pulls them, Daddy just looks and smiles.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2006\/2006_06_18-19-Montmartre.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Chatty old lady' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Chatty old lady<\/p><p>We hit the top and not only was there the impressive SacrÃ© Coeur but a whole quaint village, although it was all for the benefit of tourists. Still we bought it and loved it. We walked around the cafes, bistros and outdoor restaurants. We entered the Cathedral, circled it and promptly got out as there was a service in progress! The view on the other side of the church were even better. We could see Paris, although none of the famous landmarks.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2006\/2006_06_18-22-Montmartre.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Chatty old lady' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Chatty old lady<\/p><p>There was a funicular down the other side of the hill to a little play area for us. For some reason we were not interested in the carrousel which was a shame. Next mission was to get some dinner. We eventually found a cafe-restaurant where we had an Italian meal. Great come to France to get Italian. Time was really marching on and it was well passed our bedtime.... We retraced our steps and within about half an hour we were back in the hotel, getting showered and being naughty and not sleeping! The room was trÃ¨s chaud!<\/p><p>Daddy popped off to the traditional French bar next door and watched The French draw 1-1 with South Korea.

He's braver than Katie when we went on a fairground ride.

The rain got stronger so we went on the fairground ride, which Ben loved and Katie hated and had a short play in the soft play area.<\/p><p>We then saw the meercats being fed, penguins swimming under water, some piranhas and some parrots.<\/p><p>We went into the sea lion section, which had a large glass tunnel which we could go in and watch the sea lions swimming around us.

There was also a Zeedonk... half zebra, half donkey!<\/p><p>We again went inside and saw a small hippo, some leaf carrying ants, and the quickest tortoises you're likely to see.

Mummy was not happy at this news, thinking that she was going be in for a long labour like Katie.<\/p><p>The contraction were getting stronger and by 2 o'clock mummy was on the pethadene. Daddy was continually giving support, words of encouragement, back massages and more importantly a hand, a finger to squeeze, a neck to strangle, and a face to scratch!!! By 3:30am mummy was pleading for her mother and for an anaesthetist to give her an epidural. The pain was so much mummy was reduced to pleading like a little girl would do for her dollies or something she really wanted. She was desperate for some pain relief. However, the midwives and daddy wanted to steer away from this. By 4:20am, mummy was fully dilated and time had come to push. It was a difficult half an hour, but finally the head popped out after 2 or 3 pushes. It was an amazing sight for daddy to see the little baby's head. However their seemed to be a complication and Daddy was asked to ring the buzzer for outside help. 2 or 3 pushes later the rest of the baby was born, with the umbilical cord wrapped around its head. The cord was cut by the nurse, and as they quickly rushed it over to the ressuitere. Daddy noticed it was a boy. The sister who had joined us give a dose of narcane to resuscitate the baby. Mummy and Daddy were both really worried, but also quite emotional that they had given birth to a baby boy. We were assured he would be OK. A second dose of narcane did bring him round.<\/p><p>He was cleaned up and checked over. Mummy then gave birth to the placenta 5 minutes after Benjamin was born, and then mummy and Benjamin had their first cuddle. Daddy had one as well. He weighed in at a might 9lbs 2oz, but he really didn't look that big.<\/p><p>He didn't look that battered and bruised. He had a slight cone head, and the eyes were puffed up, otherwise he had petite facial features. His hands looked like old mans, his scrotum was swollen and feet were really spread as if his toes were stretched. He had a slight tongue tie, like Katie, and he seems to have two bottom holes, one sealed up. He took to the breast straight away which was a great news.<\/p><p>Mummy then had to have 2 stitches, before we were left alone as a three.<\/p><p>Jane and Vicky were superb midwives, and we were very lucky to have them.<\/p><p>Over the next 4 hours we made our phone calls.

Mummy was settled in, and Daddy returned back home, where Charlotte, Ellie and Ma Ma looked after me. Daddy went to bed to get some sleep for a few hours, whilst mummy done the same. Because mummy had 'Strep B', Benjamin was under close observation. At one point his temperature went right down, so he was wrapped up well and had an electric blanket over him.<\/p><p>Daddy returned with Katie and the Weston girls at 3pm, for their first viewing. At first Katie thought it was Joey lying in the cot, but she soon was told and she gave him a kiss. She was more concerned with hiding in the curtains than seeing Benjamin.<\/p><p>We had Great Grandma and Grand ad, Auntie Sue and Karen come to visit as well. It was chucking out time at 5pm, for rest and meal time. Daddy returned home with me and fed and bathed me before putting me to bed.

There were some happy and sad moments. Farmor had remarked how spritely and how much more 'with it', Oldemor seemed to be, recalling a story when Farmor had picked up dog muck from her playschool days. We also managed to get her to laugh, and she herself showing her dry sense of humour, teasing Farmor.<\/p><p>There were bits that Daddy found hard to take. When they arrived at the home there was a communal brunch. The woman opposite, looked and behaved half dead, eyes shut, opening a tiny fraction infrequently and not responding to Farmor's hello's. There was another lady shouting and complaining about the service, whilst another was shouting to go back home and wanting her mother. It was desperately sad, and to think Oldemor went off to the zoo just a couple of months ago, and now to be classified with these others.<\/p><p>Oldemor's room is a bit sparse, so Farmor and Daddy put some pictures on the wall, brought some ornaments and of course some flowers to brighten the place up. She has a little hall way, with a wardrobe, a toilet and her room has a window facing some other flats, a TV that she can't operate and an electronic bed. The room could do with some carpet, as it sounds very hollow. Still it is temporary and we can only hope she gets somewhere nicer soon.<\/p><p>Farmor had to leave early on Sunday, so Daddy went over to visit and this time managed to take Oldemor out to Mossel Lake where they had 'cafe og wienerbrÃ¸d'. It was so nice to see her out and breathing some fresh air, seeing children and others jogging or cycling again. However, on the last day Daddy was there she was getting so much better, that she was confused why she was there. She couldn't understand that she lived there and not at Kaerholmen. Daddy was frequently asked where she lived, and what time are we going back. It was so sad.<\/p><p>Her short term memory is bad at times, but otherwise you could have a normal conversation with her. On the Saturday she may have forgotten that she couldn't walk and tried to get out of the wheelchair and fell to the floor. I just wouldn't like to think how long it took the staff to notice she was on the floor. Many tears were shed. Only after you have been to see her can Daddy appreciate how different Mormor is. Only to think 2 months ago, she had her independence<\/p><p>Still Farmor is going to get back out there again in 2 weeks time. I hope we can go and see her as soon as my brother or sister is allowed to fly.

Even though Mummy had supposedly look up the place where we were going to, she hadn't so we didn't know exactly where we were going. Anyway we eventually found 'The Oak Park', Carshalton. We started walking, but of course Mummy needed the toilet straight away. So we headed towards the cafe first. We now started properly. A lovely park. However, we didn't see much of it as Mummy was convinced that the walk was to take out of the park. So we clambered over the style gate into a farmerâs field. We had to pick Katie up, because where there weren't brambles and stinging nettles, there were deep ruts, nice for you to turn your ankle in! We reached the top of the hill and the views were amazing. The farmer had laid out all this polythene sheeting on his crop of something, I assume to protect it from the local wildlife. On the horizon Highdown and Downview prison could be seen.<\/p><p>No matter, we could see some horses in the next field, so we quickly trotted over to see them. They were enclosed, so we could go close enough to give them a stroke. They were like shire horses. Anyway we decided to get a photo as Katie loved photo's. As Mummy took the photo, daddy step back on to the fence. It was an electric fence!!! Arrgghh. So we have a face of Daddy just when he's being electrocuted. Certainly got the heart racing.<\/p><p>Out of the field we went onto a main road, with no paths, just fast vehicles! Great conditions for a 21 month year old.<\/p><p>We dived into the next field and Mummy made us walk up this hill. Daddy insisted there would be a dead end at the top. Mummy of course doesn't listen to Daddy's expert advice. Of course Daddy was right and 15 minutes later we waded through the long, wet grass back to where we were. The only direction open us was east. However, this was going towards a mobile home park. As we got closer there were kids playing football, with Irish accents. It was like a scene out of Snatch! Anyhow we curbed the foul mouthed boys, covering up Katie's ears and made our way around the back of the estate hoping to reach the main road again.<\/p><p>All of a sudden a pit or bull (or related) came scarpering from the camp, that was it. Mummy too scared to carry on down the path, so we had to go back again this time making our way through the mobile village. We were immediately accosted by some Irish, gyppo kids. \"Who are you?\". Nice. Anyway we hurriedly walked through the camp, back to the main road, then another 20 minute walk back to the park and the car! What a disastrous scenic, relaxing walk.<\/p><p>We drove across to Purley hoping to catch Fi and Kelly. However, we couldn't get hold of them, so sat in Tesco car park, eating a nice lunch that Daddy got us.<\/p><p>We then decided to go down the M23 to the coast. Brighton was the first idea, then Worthing, but finally we settled at stopping at Littlehampton.<\/p><p>We walked by the mouth of the River Arun. There was a small scaled fun fair there. I wouldn't go on the car roundabout ride, finally settling on a 10 minute go on the trampoline. I loved it. Had a great time on there.<\/p><p>We had an ice cream on the beach and walked down to touch the sea, then back again.

Like at Longleat the monkeys took a fancy to our car. A couple of them climbed on the roof, one of them done a big plop, then decided to tread it in to various parts of the car. Looking forward to seeing mummy clean that one up! Daddy was getting a bit worried because the petrol gauge was on empty, and the warning light was on. However, we managed to get out OK.<\/p><p>After the driving around we went to stroke the wallabies, played on the outdoor adventure playground, went in the mini-monkey enclosure, saw the sea lion show, played in the soft play area, where daddy went on the vertical drop slide. We also saw the cute penguins (Daddy's favourites), went in the area where you can hold lemurs and went to the elephant ring and actually touched the rough skin of an elephant. Wow wee.

It was cool there as there were 4 or 5 other children there, and new toys to play with. The 'do' itself was very nice, with loads of marquee's in the garden and nice food. All the usual suspects were there. Grandma had a very interesting chat with Lindey's brother about what he got up to the night before.

We started by going across the Thames, to Trafalgar Square, through to St James's park where we fed the ducks, talked to the geese and got close up to the pelicans. I kept saying \"duck, duck\" to all the birdies, and kept trying to go up to them all. I think I would spend all day there if mummy and daddy didn't keep moving me on! We saw Buckingham Palace, walked through Green Park, up to Piccadilly Circus where we stopped for some lunch. We then walked all the way back up to Hyde Park and went through the nice gardens, stopped off under the kissing tree, walked passed some more ducks in the serpentine until we eventually got to Princess Diana's memorial fountain. There wasn't actually a fountain there, but more of a looped toboggan run with streaming water. It was fun to put my feet in the cold water. Very refreshing. I had a bit of a run around in the grassy bit in the middle and played with another boy for a bit, before we caught a bus back to Charing Cross and walked back to Waterloo station. Then daddy decided to get lost, so mummy and I travelled alone back to Woking, leaving daddy searching around a packed, rush hour station for us. We eventually found each other back at Woking.

We then went around to the monkeys where one clambered on to our car which was very exciting and hitched a lift. When the monkey decided to get off, he took half the windscreen wiper as well!!! We moved onto see lions and tigers. After the safari park bit we had a picnic looking at the big stately home, then went to look at pet world and have ago on the little train ride around the park.

We returned home in the late afternoon and flaked out.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2004\/2004_05_30-33-PenarthVickey.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Katie in Vickyâs back garden' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Katie in Vickyâs back garden<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Over to Vickster's (2)"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":29,"m":5,"y":2004},"datev":20040529,"images":1,"info":{"content":"<p>Us lot and Ellie and Michael went over to see Vicky in Penarth.

Daddy woke up at Barrie house with the rest of the boys (Barrie, Martin, Nick and Michael) in the front room at about 5am.... everyone was on a bit of a high and excited for the day ahead. Daddy apparently looked a bit nervous, and instead of the Best Man looking after the groom, it was more like the other way round! The dam cat (Jinx Man) made sure they weren't going to sleep well. They managed to make their way over to Safeway's for breakfast, except Daddy, who couldn't eat. They then proceeded to go over to the hotel. Uncle Michael went back home to see Mummy and I. The hotel was ideal. Small enough to have exclusive ownership for the day, big enough to hold 60\/80\/100 guests. It was an old manor house from the 17th century. The gardens surrounding it, were in perfect order. We took a look around, saw the marquee around the back where the disco, meal and speeches were to take place. Barrie noticed he was still wearing his paint ridden work watch, and he had forgotten the money for the orchestra. So daddy made a trip home with him to get all the stuff together. We started to get ready at 11-ish. Daddy didn't know how to do his cravat or put cufflinks on! What a woos. Anyway they all posed for photo's before moving on to Odiham.<\/p><p>Meanwhile Mummy and I were at Auntie Ellie's getting ready. Back in Odiham the boys were in The Bell, for a swifty. Barrie had a pint of shandy (what a girl)! Anyway time was marching on and about half an hour before the wedding we decided to make our way up the hill to the church. The orchestra had already started to play... and Bazza was at last looking a little nervous. He spent most of the time in the front pew. It was nice for Daddy to see his old lollypop lady and friends and family. Farmor and Far were even there. Mummy and I eventually arrived and sat near the back.<\/p><p>The ceremony started just a little after 1:30pm, and Laura looked 'trÃ¨s bien'. Barrie didn't know whether he was allowed to look as she came down the aisle. Barrie and Laura exchanged smiles and the vicar commenced with the service. The Dunc-meister was chief camera man. Boy has he got a cheeky grin on him. Made the best men laugh throughout the service. Everyone done their bit. The fathers done their readings, James and I handed over the wedding rings and the bridesmaids looked good. Finally the proceedings ended, the happy couple walked back up the aisle and the Best Men, linked, arm in arm followed.<\/p><p>The happy couple posed for photo's outside, which if I haven't mentioned, was a lovely day weather wise. The confetti was sprinkled and the happy couple left in their old, black car towards to the reception, stopping off for a quick 10 minute breather.<\/p><p>Everyone got to the Hook House hotel safely (as far as we know!) and spilled out onto the lush lawns with their sparkling wine and orange juice. Barrie and Laura arrived and the hour photo session began. All sorts of photos were taken, including one where we had to hold Laura horizontally across our mid-rifts. Anyway Baz was steadily getting more grumpy that he had to smile in them! That boy doesn't like to smile too much!! He's probably taken up his whole year's supply of smiling up.<\/p><p>There was no time between the photo's and ushering the gatherings in for the wedding breakfast. This is when the best men were trying to sneak in all the props for their speech and getting everything ready. They looked remarkably relaxed, they even managed their meals. Mummy and I were on the same table as Daddy's friends and his mum and dad, as well as Ellie and Michael. We had melon for starter, chicken for main, and a choice between chocolate cake and fruit salad for pudding. The speeches started with David, Laura dad. He reminded everyone of Laura's mischiefness when she was a child. Bazza was then next to stand, and mentioned how it was Laura's dream, but his nightmare. I'm not sure if he was joking or not!! He also distributed some presents which was a nice touch and daddy got a 'Best Man' tankard. Then the attention turned to Daddy and James. Nervous. The first joke went off OK, the second even better, the picture gags were also a hit..... but it then seemed to dry up a bit on the laughs front. Still it is not all about the laughs. They gave a fair account of Baz and touched on all the right subjects. They stood for about 15 minutes before the nightmare over the past 14 months and especially last 3 months was over for them. People came up to them and said it went well.<\/p><p>Tables were cleared, beer could be consumed, and the evening guests began to arrive. The bouncy castle was a big hit for the kids. They certainly got their monies worth out of it. The cake was cut, and the disco man started the party. It was soon my bed time and luckily we had a room at the hotel for me to lie down in. Everyone took it in turns to come and baby-sit me during the night.<\/p><p>Auntie Susan and Graham turned up, as well as Grandpop and Grandma. Lots of chatting and drinking, and daddy even had a go on the bouncy castle with the rest of the boys. Unfortunately daddy received blows to the cheek, but Mr Aves managed to acquire a bloody nose. Mr King decided to come in with his knees at one point!!! He is dirt. Other highlights from the evening was when Joyce had so much to drink, she couldn't actually walk without assistance. Quite funny for us, but not for Steven or Joyce no doubt. Still people have laughed at daddy in the past, for similar misgivings. The evening guests had to finally leave around the 11pm mark, but the bar was re-opened for the hotel guests, of which there must have been up to 20 or so people. Daddy was absolutely knackered at 1am and finally turned in.

Mummy and Daddy wanted to officially introduce me to the church.... well ok mainly mummy. It happened at St Nicholas church in Southfleet. The reason why we have chosen a church so far from where we, and most of the congregation live is because we, or more accurately mummy has been going to that church from when she    was a little child and it holds special memories as it is the place mummy and daddy were wed. Three people were specially chosen to be my godparents. We decided to pick from outside of the family, as we reckon family members have already got a special role in my life. Kindly mummy's friends Helen and Karen, who are regular church go'ers have agreed to be Godmothers.    We were scratching our heads quite hard to find one of daddy's friends who was religious and responsible!!! In fact, none of daddy's friends are that religious, so daddy's best mate    (and best man at the wedding) Barrie has stepped into the role of 'The Godfather'!!<\/p><ul><li><i>morning<\/i>We woke fairly early and played in bed as usual. Then it got all very rushed (as usual) and we made it to the church, with only 10 minutes to spare! The church was   full. There was the normal congregation and my christening was integrated with it. It was a really nice service. Half way through, mummy, daddy and my godparents had to all stand    at the front and renounce all evil, which they luckily did. Clifford, the vicar then took me on a tour all around the church to welcome me to all the regular church go'ers. I was a very brave girl and didn't cry once. We had a few more hymns and a sermon, which I got a few mentions in before we headed over to the Woodlands pub for a bite to eat.\u000a        <\/li><li><i>afternoon<\/i>Everyone eventually got to the Woodlands where we had the hall upstairs to ourselves. We chilled and had a drink. It was nice for Mummy and Daddy to catch up with friends and family who they haven't seen for yonks. It was really nice atmosphere. Daddy gave a short speech (which he HATES doing) and toasted me! Way Hey. We   must have been there for 2.5 hours before everyone filtered out. Thank you to all those who came.\u000a        <\/li><li><i>evening<\/i>&gt;We went back to Grandma's and Grandpop's where we began to open all the lovely presents. We didn't realize how generous people had been until we got home. I got some religious bits, crockery, toys and even some money. Far too much stuff to put down here. We travelled back after a cup of tea. Farfar and Farmor came   round later to help me open the rest of the presents and cards. Overall a very good day, and thank you for all my presents.

I didn't want to think I failed because I didn't prepare how I wanted to. I had a big bowl of porridge for breakfast and trotted down the paper shop to get Lau's grandpop a paper. I wanted to make sure I was properly warmed up and felt loose. We left at about 8:15 and drove to Blackheath and got there about 8:30.<\/p><p>There were lots of people, not many drove it seemed. Plenty of warming up, going to the toilet. It was one of the warmest days of the year and sunny. There was a great friendly, nervous atmosphere, with helicopters floating about. Martin and Dad rang me up just before the race to wish me good luck. Laura was there to support me. We kept shuffling forward as 9am approached. Loads of people got rid of their sweatshirts and just lobbed them to the side. I didn't even know the race had started. It wasn't until 9:15 until I crossed the start line!<\/p><p>I took it very easy to begin with, and enjoyed it. It was great with the cheering crowds. My nervous tension meant I had to go to the toilet after the first 3 miles. The pace was effortless, but slow. At 3 miles we joined with the other starters and booed at them. It was a great atmosphere. At this point you could appreciate the enormity of the volume of people.<\/p><p>The first milestone point was at the Cutty Sark (7 miles) where Laura waited for me. It must have taken me an hour to get there. There were so many people watching, I didn't see Lau. We had agreed to see each other a mile or so on, so from then on I was just looking at the crowd, but couldn't see her or my parents, who said they must have just missed me.<\/p><p>Anyway come the 8\/9 mile marker in Bermondsey, the marathon really began. The honeymoon period was over. The crowds were sparse and competitors a bit more concentrated. This is where the mental side began for me to tell myself to keep going. I just kept at my own pace. I reached Tower Bridge and I picked up with all the crowds. I felt a bit sad that I hadn't seen anyone and consigned myself not to seeing anyone as how would they know where I was?<\/p><p>Half way was reached in 2:15 minutes which I was pleased at. I thought from here onwards was the most I or any of my friends had run. We saw all the runners coming back who had done 21\/22 miles. I just could not comprehend running that fast. I quickly tired, and went to the toilet up a side street, I also stopped for a minute at 14 miles. I felt so disappointed in myself, but I felt light headed. I thought I was in need of sugar. 30 seconds late I began again. Luckily kids were handing out Jelly Babies and sweets. I grabbed them. My health improved again and I felt mentally very positive again, even though my body wasn't.<\/p><p>Many people had stopped to walk at 15 miles, so it felt good overtaking a lot of people. I kept going like this for another 5\/6 miles. I saw Laura by Marsh Wall (I think) which was really nice. I hope she was proud of me. I enjoyed this part as the scenery was different and I was proud of myself for keeping running, wondering where I got my stamina from.<\/p><p>At 20 miles I was struggling again and felt hungry. I saw mum and dad for the first time. Mum looked really proud of me. I asked for food. Eventually I got a Frusli bar (oat bar) and a banana off them. They had to run after me to give it to me, which was quite funny.<\/p><p>On exiting the Isle Of Dogs I felt I was on the last lap and all I had to do is keep going and not stop. I saw runners coming the other way, who had only done 14 miles. I felt poor sods. Although still positive in thought, my body just couldn't do much more. Nothing really hurt, just my legs couldn't do much more. I ran under Tower Bridge (22 miles), but had to start walking where the cobbled street came. I tried to start again, but really couldn't. I think I was up to about 4hrs 15mins at this point. I couldn't even walk fast! Other walkers were overtaking me! The crowds were still there.<\/p><p>At 24\/25 miles I kept coming over all emotional. Sort of crying. I don't know what that was all about. I got to parliament and the crowds were massive. I saw Susan and Graham and was able to jog again, down Birdcage Walk. This was a bit of luck as Mum and Dad were 50 yards further up with the camcorder, making it look like I'd run all the way! I turned past Bucking Palace and ran past the finish line. I felt proud and happy with myself. My official time was 5hrs 35mins, but I take the 15 minutes off to give myself 5hrs 20mins. I got my medal and someone took my chip off my shoes. I couldn't sit down, I had to make my way to the end of the Mall. Susan and Graham were by the fence. Laura was at the end, by this stage it was difficult to walk.<\/p><p>Lau and I went over to the Foreign Press Association offices between the Mall and Pall Mall. There I had some much needed food and a 20\/30 minute massage. It was nice, but I am not sure it really helped. The masseur on the next table was a fit blonde. Probably a good idea she didn't get me. Phwoaarr.<\/p><p>We struggled to Charing Cross via Piccadilly Circus. We eventually made it back to Lee, although Laura couldn't find the car! I then drove home and rested for the rest of the day.

I grew weary of walking and waited till around 4:30pm where I went to buy some flowers and prepared to wait at the hotel. They were already there! I left the flowers in the door way with a note saying something along the lines, 'I've been watching you and think you're really gorgeous. From another carer'. I got a hotel man to get Laura who found the flowers and the note. She went back to the chalet and laughed nervously with her mum. She caught me watching her and she was very pleased to see me. I met the three clients, we played pool and darts before I had to return home.<\/p><woops rating=\"6\" woopstitle=\"Towed to a Hearse Garage at 3am!!\"><p>After taking 4.5 hours getting to Margate, with the leaking water tank, I had the pleasurable task of getting home! Having reached Detling, just outside Maidstone, I could see grey clouds bellowing from my exhaust, as I was stopping in a garage the car stalled. I feared the worst, and thought it was some sought of seizure. It didn't sound right as I turned the car over.<\/p><p>I phoned dad who was at the football club to come and rescue me. At about 11:30pm (3.5 hours after I left Margate) he arrived. We tied up some blue rope and I was in my own car, making sure bit bumping into Dad. The rope only gave a maximum of one car length between us, and guess what we pulled out and the first hill was saw had an 11% sign!! It wasn't a nice experience as the rope kept slackening and then yanking and because the servos on the brakes weren't as good as usual I was afraid of going into the back of the 'tank' (dads car).<\/p><p>However, we never came close. We stopped shortly afterwards. Dad was ready to set off again but I hadn't put the key in the ignition to unlock the steering wheel yet! So I slammed on the brakes whilst I frantically looked for the key. Dad was struggling to set off, revving up his car. Luckily I found it quickly in my pocket and we were off again.<\/p><p>Another big problem was that in order to preserve my battery, I switched off my lights in lit areas. This made it difficult at times to see 'the tank'. The rope finally snapped in Maidstone. We stopped and someone got us a proper tow rope, and off we went again.<\/p><p>The lights began to dim, and I was getting extremely tired. We eventually stopped in a garage in Riverhead, Sevenoaks and we got home at 3am! Unknown to us we dumped the car in a Hearse garage. A fitting end. I had managed to buckle the cylinders, but of course they were just about OK to be fixed and a week later I was back on the road.<\/p><\/woops>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Margate Car Breakdown - Part I"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":1,"m":8,"y":1999},"datev":19990801,"info":{"content":"<p>I went off to Croquet and beat Andy Davies, while Laura went off for a week with her mum and Ellie to Margate, taking some mentally handicapped people out.<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Croquet and Start of Laura's Margate Trip"},"version":1},{"date":{"m":8,"y":1999},"datev":19990800,"images":2,"info":{"content":"<p>We went to watch a polo match somewhere near Windsor<\/p><img src='images\/years\/1999\/1999_XX-XX-Summer-Polo1.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Polo' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Polo<\/p><img src='images\/years\/1999\/1999_XX-XX-Summer-Polo2.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Polo' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Polo<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Polo Match"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":31,"m":7,"y":1999},"datev":19990731,"info":{"content":"<p>I noticed I had a pay rise of 10% now making me on Â£19,250.

I couldn't believe it! She asked a man where the restaurant was then comes back to me and says 'he's Italian too', which gave it away.

I mean who are the only people who could get lost on a canal, there's only one path!

By this time it was getting quite hot. Lau took a picture of me outside the house before we continued  westwards along the canal. At one point a kid chucked a bit of roll at me from the other side of the canal. Cheeky so and so. We made it through Islington until we came across the very long tunnel, which didn't have a tow path. We rejoined via Rodney Street! We went through Regent's Park after going through the busy Camden Town. we again were forced off the canal route by Lords cricket ground.<\/p><p>The World Cup Final was being played, Australia Vs Pakistan. As we were biking along a street to rejoin the canal, half a dozen Pakistani's were in a shouting match with some others who taunted at them about Australia winning.

I thought this is a bad place to go seeing that the Kosovo crisis had just began. We found a nice, big church near Lexington Avenue, but it began a little later. Just enough time for us to go off exploring the east side a little more. Lexington Park and Madison Avenue had a nice atmosphere about them. The lower numbered avenues were also nice and more refreshing than the busier west side. We hit first avenue and saw the UN building again.<\/p><p>We returned back to the church hurriedly (as someone was worried about the time). The service was much the same as in England. People seem to take it more seriously, dressing up, singing louder. The choir was excellent. We took communion and an hour and a half later exited the church and went to a diner like in Pulp Fiction for some lunch. We then headed to the bus station for the second half of our bus tour, Central Park and Harlem. This was much more enjoyable than the previous tour as the lady commentator was better and we had good seats. We saw where John Lennon was shot, the whole of Central Park and Harlem where it was spot the white man. The shops there were very cheap. Low quality clothing and electrical stuff. We got off early and wandered round the souvenir shops buying tacky things. Laura laughed at me for wanting to go in these shops. To be honest every shop did seem the same. We slowly walked back to the hotel via the westerly avenues. We stumbled across a massive sports complex in Chelsea. It was brilliant having an all sports arena from ice hockey to football to gymnastics. A separate are dedicated to each sport. There were also exclusive boats trips. We also looked at the local heliport nearby, but decided against a helicopter trip as we had seen enough. Walking through Chelsea I was pleasantly surprised what a nice area this looked. If I had to live in New York it would be here. We finally reached the hotel, packed our clothes and quickly walked back uptown to the Mars 2012 cafe, another of Laura's theme cafes.<\/p><p>This one surpassed the Rainforest cafe visit in terms of gimmicks. You don't book a table, you get a boarding pass for the shuttle flight. The flight attendant then introduces us to the cafe and then to our simulated flight. We then went to Mars where the bar was situated. It looked like something out of Star Wars. The prices had already been inflated to 2012 levels I think!! Our name was displayed on screen 20 minutes later which meant we could enter the restaurant area and eat. It was like being inside a huge cave or volcano. It was brilliant. The service was good and tables set apart from one another so you could have a private conversation. It was huge inside. Down to our last pennies we couldn't afford much. We even shared the drink.

I double checked the ring was with us as we left to head back towards the southern tip of the Island. We caught the subway again and headed for 'Clinton Castle' where we bought tickets for the 25 minute crossing to Liberty Island.<\/p><p>This area interested me the most as this where New York was colonised. The statue is the symbol of freedom and was donated by the French as was the first view that immigrants had of New York. The statue had in the past 10 years been cleaned up and renovated to its past glory. The boat was packed with tourists. The Island itself was packed and there was a 3 hour queue to Liberty herself. Having a full days schedule, we didn't have time to waste. There was a band and dancers performing which gave a really good atmosphere to the place. We ventured to the edge of the Island where there were spectacular views back to Manhattan. I was obsessed (well so Laura says) of getting some pictures of us, in front of the postcard scenery. We walked around Liberty to return to the queue for the 5 minute boat journey to Ellis Island.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/1999\/1999_03_XX-NewYork72.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='New York - Statue Of Liberty' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>New York - Statue Of Liberty<\/p><img src='images\/years\/1999\/1999_03_XX-NewYork49.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='New York - Our Picture Postcard' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>New York - Our Picture Postcard<\/p><p>Now this really did interest me (oh yes Norman!). It was difficult to capture any kind of atmosphere or resemblance of how it used to be, with 100's of thousands travelling through. Again there were many tourists here. We went to see an informative and interesting film about immigration and Ellie Island. Although it only last an hour, I was knackered and kept falling asleep even though I really wanted to watch it. We had a look around the exhibition for about half an hour but had to leave if we were going to fit everything in.<\/p><p>We returned to shore, caught a hot dog, and ate it looking over to the Island we had just visited. With my 'Norman' hat on, we followed a walk as described in the guide book. I read aloud as we walked. Laura couldn't believe how sad I was, but she loves me for it. We took in a lot of historic offices, a medium sized church that used to be a toilet building in New York, where George Washington was inaugurated. We then reached the World Trade Centre which is a collection of buildings but are famous for the twins towers that make New York's current tallest building. Again we queued for half and an hour or so. The lift took us quickly to the top floor. This time we were inside, but we could see all the way down as we could press our noses right on to the glass building. We had clear, spectacular views of the whole of Manhattan and could see much of Brooklyn. It was a beautiful sunny afternoon. Whilst we were up there we had to go on the helicopter ride simulator around Manhattan. We also had a drink in the cafeteria, before returning back to 'terra cotta' (as Del Boy would say)!<\/p><img src='images\/years\/1999\/1999_03_XX-NewYork75.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='New York - World Trade Centre' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>New York - World Trade Centre<\/p><p>We quickly exited and followed the guided walk around. We trundled along, but I started to get worried about the time. Although we were close to Brooklyn Bridge, I knew it would take a while to cross. We seamlessly made our way to the bridge, as the sun began to lower from the sky. I can remember the reflections on the buildings as we looked across. I was anxiously trying to pick out Brooklyn Heights, but I couldn't see it. Anyway, we eventually found the bridge footpath which runs above the traffic. It was a wooden walkway. Laura's feet were hurting from her shoes, so she took them off, which I gladly carried. As we walked across the sun was descending quickly as we admired the fantastic views of the buildings, the lights and the traffic. Half an hour later we reached the other side. I doubled checked that the ring was with me. I wasn't particularly nervous. I just wanted to ask her.<\/p><p>Once we reached the end we headed south. Laura knew we were going to the heights. We asked for directions and walked down a nice quiet residential street.<\/p><p>We finally made it. It was pretty dark by now which was a shame in some ways, but added to the atmosphere in others. The location was perfect, only a couple that were chatting to each other on a bench 40 yards away and one or two couples walking by. The atmosphere was relaxed and tranquil as the traffic could only be heard in the distance. We parked our bags on one of the rows of black, cast iron benches. Laura went to the railings to look across the water towards Manhattan. This was a chance for me to discretely set the video camera up and get the ring out. Now my adrenalin was flowing quickly. I went up to Laura, who still had her back turned. We kissed for a while and then got the ring box out, and so we were still close to each other presented the box, opened it, and asked \"Will you marry me?\" It was a bit of a blur after that, but I don't think I even got a 'yes' answer. She didn't even look at the ring. Instead I got crushed with a big hug. I could tell it took Laura aback, she was lost for words. There was a lot of feeling there. I felt glad on the one hand it was no longer a secret, the other happy that Laura was happy and happy myself for her wanting to spend the rest of our lives together.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/1999\/1999_03_XX-NewYork56.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='New York' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>New York<\/p><img src='images\/years\/1999\/1999_03_XX-NewYork59.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='New York' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>New York<\/p><p>We chatted back over Brooklyn Bridge about the whole setup and who knew. We walked to Little Italy where we found a restaurant to have a celebratory meal. Neither of us fancied champagne and to be honest felt like nothing had really changed. We still loved each other the same, still felt as close. I think this was the case as we both know what we wanted, we both wanted each other so much. I felt excited as we took a step closer to our goal of living together and marriage. We finished our meal and headed home early-ish as we had another exhausting day.<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"NY Trip - !!

However before that we caught the subway to go to Wall Street to see the Stock Exchange which is only open during the week. We queued for a while, but eventually got in to see the trading floor for about 15 minutes.<\/p><p>We then subbed it back to the other side of town to catch a bus from 42nd and 8th. The subway seemed to have more room inside the carriages to the London Underground. However, the stations themselves didn't seem to be a friendly place to be, with large cast iron black fences which reached to the ceiling and turnstiles designed in a similar fashion. It cost roughly 60p a ride. We rushed to queue for the bus only to find it was leaving 20 minutes later than advertised.<\/p><p>We left the city west into New Jersey. There was a lot of nothing on our 1\/5 hour trip. There were many megastore type places and on one particular dual carriage way there was shop upon shop for about 10 miles. It was quite amazing. You have to drive to each shop. After a fair while the landscape turned hilly, rocky and green. It was a refreshing change to the bland, flat landscape previously.<\/p><p>We finally arrived at the 200+ shopping outlet for fashion stores rejects are unsold lines. I was expecting swarms of people like Camberley on a Saturday morning. However, it was very quiet. The sun was shining and we were ready to shop. It was fantastic. The prices were cheap, the shops were practically empty, the sun was shining. I had money set aside to spend and 'my honey' could carry all the bags for me!! No not that last bit.<\/p><p>I bought some Skechers for $40, some smart suit shoes from another place for a similar place, some large smelly candles (which I later found in England to be cheaper!), two pairs of Dockers chinos for $50 the pair. A Nike top reduced from $70 to $20, a Calvin Klien jumper at $15 and some Vans shorts for $5 each. I really wanted a black hat exactly like Greg Normans, but Laura wouldn't let me, and I had run out of money. I bought Laura a top as a consolation for her. We flukely caught an earlier bus back, but it stuck heavily of toxic smell. I almost passed out.<\/p><p>We walked with all our shopping to Planet Hollywood where we had a meal. This is something Laura wanted. I personally would have preferred somewhere else, especially as you could walk into one of these back in England.

We decided to go on a sightseeing bus tour, first taking the southern loop which took in the highlights of downtown Manhattan. To begin with it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. The bus was noisy so we couldn't hear the guide. It was also cramped and we seemed to be stuck in traffic all the time. However, we saw the other parts of New York. It looked as any other city as we travelled between mid-town and downtown. Then we began to come into China town and Little Italy. The roads were not in grid positions which strangely was a refreshing change. This area had a certain charm about it. A lot of old buildings. I was interested to hear the history of the oldest part of New York. We then reached the financial region, down at the southern tip. We stopped here for a short break. On the next stage we sat closer to the front where we could hear the guide, but nothing much he said was particularly interesting. In fact he kept going on about tipping him.<\/p><p>We were eventually dropped off at about 2pm at the Astoria Hotel and Central Park. The weather was fine and we decided to go for a walk in the famous park. The park is vast and was designed over 100 years ago. There are many characteristics to the park: hilly, ponds, flat, rocky, trees. We walked past a pond first, past an ice staking rink and sat by some rocks. There we wrote our postcards and rested for a while. We didn't go too far north. We exited to the east on to 5th Avenue. We looked at a more salubrious part of Manhattan. These streets were more quiet and there were many hotels as we dodged to Lexington Avenue.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/1999\/1999_03_XX-NewYork65.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='New York - Entrance To Central Park' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>New York - Entrance To Central Park<\/p><p>We found Bloomingdales which was huge, nicely presented, huge number of lines and some very expensive items. We also went into the Spy shop briefly and the Sony experience place which was free and we spent a couple of hours in there.<\/p><p>We found a diner in which to eat. I loved it. It was a typical diner with stools all along the serving bar and a huge mirror, so the vain could watch themselves eat. We couldn't afford much and embarrassingly gave a small tip.<\/p><p>On our way back we explored the Rockefeller building and watched part of the ice skating that was strangely there.<\/p><p>We de-toured and headed for a cinema in Time Square to watch 'Analyze This'. We wanted to see a film that hadn't reached our shores. We were so tired after this we wearily walked home.<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"NY Trip - Bus tour, Central Park, Bloomingdales, Sony Experience, Rockefeller, Cinema"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":24,"m":3,"y":1999},"datev":19990324,"images":1,"info":{"content":"<p>An early departure for our memorable trip abroad. Dad dropped us off at terminal 3 at about 7:15am and we headed for check in at United Airlines. We were greeted with a note offering us to travel on a later flight, arriving at Newark airport for Â£800 each. A chance not to be missed. So we volunteered for this. We checked in and looked around duty free for 20 minutes. I wanted to make sure we had the best possible chance of qualifying by getting to the boarding point first, so our names would be top of the list. However, it didn't work that way and we were not chosen. We boarded and took off at about 9:30am.<\/p><p>Laura done her usual 'Brace as hard as possible' routine. I thought she was going to have a baby the way she was going. Our flight lasted 7.5 hours and passed quickly with a couple of films and meals to occupy us. The TV screen was built into the back of the seat which was quite neat. We even had a tracking system to guide us, and report our location, speed and altitude. It was a bit cloudy when we landed at about 1pm, but we noticed that even in the suburbs houses were organised in a grid pattern.<\/p><p>JFK airport wasn't as modern as we'd thought it might be. The usual intermediation of being in a new country hit us almost straight away whilst trying to organise transport for the 20 miles trip to Manhattan. There was a travel information point where we sought help. The so called helper was very official with her advice and manner. Meanwhile Laura was waiting outside with the luggage getting her shins reformed  from trolley pushers who totally disregarded what was in front of them. A bus just arrived as we rushed to get seats. Two black ticket sellers were outside and sold us return tickets and told us to hurry on to the coach. Before I knew I was short changed by $10, but only realised when I got on the bus. This made me annoyed.<\/p><p>The weather was a bit grim and drizzly, and leaving the airport we noticed how untidy everything was. Our coach trip was about 30 minutes long, and we didn't really see much on the way. We came in through Brooklyn and Queens and through Queens tunnel to Manhattan Island. As soon as we came out the other side we immediately noticed how tall the building are. They make you feel to be at the bottom of a canyon. I'd not seen anything like it before. We were slightly held up in the notorious Manhattan traffic, but were finally dropped off at Grand Central station.<\/p><p>Excited at the prospect of taking in the atmosphere of New York, we decide to walk to our hotel, with all our luggage. The Arlington Hotel which was on 25th Street by Broadway and fifth avenue. We went passed the library and the impressive Empire State building. We saw the first of many steaming man hole covers and the yellow taxi's, which seemed to make 25% of the traffic. The walk was tiresome as we had to carry all our luggage. We finally arrived at our hotel, which seemed to be in a rough par, although it seemed fine inside with a reception area and nice cafe at the back. Again the receptionist was coarse and could have some of Laura's 'happiness lessons'. The room was basic but clean. The view was other rooms of the hotel and we had an ensuite bathroom. We unpacked and I continually checked the ring was still safely tucked on my inside jacket pocket.<\/p><p>We left the hotel at about 3pm and headed for the tourist information in Time Square. We got on to Broadway, but to our surprise this area for several blocks looked decidedly dodgy. There were many foreigners, electrical shops and general untidiness. We felt a little apprehensive walking down here. However, the rundown area quickly passed. Time Square is the New York equivalent of Leicester Square. However, this had a number of busy roads running across it. In the middle there were boards up, stopping you entering a building site. There was scaffolding all over the place, seemingly holding buildings up. Having said that, we did get a piece of New York. There were loads of lit adverts, like at Piccadilly Circus, there were news feeds scrolling across, there were loads of yellow taxis, there were many shops and sky scrapers. There were such a large mix of races. I couldn't really see them as Americans. We looked at the half price ticket bureau for Broadway shows but they were still too expensive for us at $40 each. We went to the Visitor Centre (tourist information). We had to go to the bus terminal itself to buy our tickets to Woodbury Common and a sightseeing tour. Our traditional swimming baths visits would not be fulfilled here. You either had to buy a yearâs ticket for the municipal baths or go to an expensive.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/1999\/1999_03_XX-NewYork66.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='New York - Time Square' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>New York - Time Square<\/p><p>Never mind. We headed off to the bus station but inadvertently took a de-tour through the unknown then, Hellâs Kitchen area, North West of Time Square. This was once home of gang land territory. Where West Side story is supposed to have been set. Although not the nicest area, I felt safe enough. Laura however, felt a bit intimidated. While we walked along one of the busy roads I was filming. Suddenly somebody lent out of their car and yelled across, 'I love you' or something like that. It was quite funny. A lady, who was  walking towards us, who saw this remarked \"it could only happen in New York\". To which I thought \"only a comment like that could be made by a New Yorker\". We eventually made it to the bus station. By now it had got dark. It was closed!!!<\/p><p>Apparently there were two big stores not to miss. Macy's was close by so we popped in. We weren't very impressed. I expected a Harrods or Selfridges type thing. All we got was an ordinary looking department store. We only saw part of it, and I reckon we just saw the bad bit.<\/p><p>We continued east along 5th avenue and the Empire State building. To be honest the building didn't look any taller than any other big sky scraper there. It again had scaffolding around the bottom. The interior was very plush. We queued a little bit on our way up the 80 something floors. The left was quick. It took perhaps 30 seconds to get to our destination. We walked outside to the viewing gallery and the views across the New York skyline was amazing. It was very windy. It was difficult to pick out people we were so high up. The highest we'd ever been. The traffic could be seen, the whole island could almost be seen. From Central Park in the north, to the World Trade centre in the south, and bridges east and west linking the other boroughs. We were so high up and it was dark it was difficult to pick any detail out of anything. The viewing area was quite big at 15-20 metres squared. There were a couple of gift shops in the middle. Laura turned all romantic on me which was nice. I think she was hoping for a proposal. I think she thought if I was going to ask on holiday, here would be the place. Never mind eh Laura, I didn't disappoint in the end.<\/p><p>We returned back to earth, hungry. There was a Houghlihan's restaurant close by, which we entered and had a burger 'dinner'.

However, it's not easy, to keep saying that when in my heart of hearts I'd love to marry her this weekend. Not only does she harp on to me, but to our friends as well. 'Oh Martin and me are getting married' she'll say. I've told quite a few people my plan. I shouldn't really but I'm so excited by it. I haven't told work, any of Laura's family or David. She keeps bluffing me, which is a bit scary. Last night she came out with \"You're going to ask me on top of the empires state building. I know your mum told me\". For 5 or 10 seconds I believed that she knew. I do want it to be a surprise. I can't wait to see her face. I think she's going to be unbearable. I don't want it to completely over shadow the trip, so I'll give it to her the day before we leave. I plan to do it close to Brooklyn Bridge. The view from there is amazing, looking down towards Manhattan. I'm still not too sure how to ask her. I want it to be serious, but not over the top. I want to make sure we're both in a loving mood at the time. I also want to give her some presents, a CD at least.

Another night I painted an undercoat of blonde hair. Then, I combed brown paint to give it some detail. I then ventured on to the face, which I had lighten somehow, and give it character. In the end I'd finished. Now what should I do with it. Give it as an anniversary present! Instead of just giving it to her. I set it up in her bedroom as a surprise for when she returned from her late shift. I'd put a lamp underneath and switched it on, to illuminate it. When she came home I hid to make it look like it had been left there. When she saw it, she was horrified and ran into the bathroom for half an hour. She hated it and said it was like something out of the Godfather. I tried to talk her out by saying 'don't lose your head' and a million and one other puns. The story ends by me taking back the present that I'd put so much effort and planning into. Hopefully one day she'll come round.

This gave me an opportunity to prepare for the engagement in New York. First and most importantly the ring. I've already looked around Farnham and Fleet and have not seen anything suitable. I decided upon Guildford. I trundled over and must have looked around a dozen or so shops. I was beginning to get disillusioned, either rings being too ostentatious, expensive or not right. I want a diamond\/ruby ring with a thin ring or band, without a shoulder, spending between Â£250 and Â£350. I saw one cheaper at Â£150, but wanted to spend more on her. I was on my way back when I looked in Ernest Jones and saw one that met my requirements. This sounds bad, but it was Â£600 reduced to Â£300. I didn't progress any further as I needed to borrow one of Laura's rings and wanted Susan there as well to get a second opinion. I was very, very happy with my choice. It felt just right.

The game was a complete farce in the end. They played the offside trap successfully first, but soon we started beating it regularly. At time it was 3 or 4 against the keeper. The score ended up 11 or 12 nil.<\/p><p>As the game began late, we had to rush off to Gravesend, as we had Sunday lunch waiting for us. It was Laura's dad's 47th birthday.

After 3 or 4 miles I decided that I wanted to push away from the other 2 as I fancied keeping up with the club riders, which I did for a few miles.... then my chain looped in a couple of places and had to stop to my extreme annoyance for 3 or 4 minutes. I expected the other 2 to pass me, but they didn't. I continued solely but got lost from West Meon. I ended up close to Droxford. Having gone 5 or 6 miles out of my way I met up with Jon (who was on his way back) and Paul at the half way stage. I took on some much needed food and drink. I was determined to try and catch Jon up, although I went with Paul for the first 3 or 4 miles, which meant walking up some hills. Jon must have been 45 minutes ahead by now and so gave up hope passing him. I cycled on my own for all the way back, only passed by 3 or 4 club riders who were going impressively fast. My bike was a cheap wreck. I couldn't get to the bottom 7 or 8 gears nor the top 3 or 4. As a result I really struggled up the hills. I also struggled down them with less than adequate brakes! The hill at Exton was memorable, not only for its size, but because I had climbed it when I went wrong the first time round! One I would like to re-visit.<\/p><p>Quatre past two, I ambled back to the finish line. I was starving. I was surprised not to see Jon.

I have now ridden the length of the Basingstoke Canal (in chunks).<\/p><p>We rushed home as we hosted our first dinner party. Well not really a dinner party, more of an informal BBQ. The guests were David and Rachel from work. It flowed quite well, although the dinner was slightly burnt and Lau was very nervous. We sat in the back garden, and had a laugh. It was nice and something I would like to try again. We left the washing up and carried over the evening to Bracknell to watch 'Lost In Space', a sci-fi about a family and crew in space.

We packed up and checked out all our luggage, but still had 7 or 8 hours before our flight. We made our way to Nadr Holesevice station where we based all our travel around. I tried to find where we could go by train for a short excursion. The booking clerk officer was quite unhelpful and unfriendly. This was the general perception I have with the Czech people. It was quite a shock. However, we laughed it off and got help from a foreign exchange cashier. We went out to some remote town village, that had a castle at the top of the hill. We didn't make it that far, but it was nice to get out of the city. The train journey was a bit weird. The train pulled out of the station for about 100 yards. Then stopped, broke down.

At 7:20am she was quite nervous. Mum and Dad took us to the airport and we were free to look around the duty free. Laura was quite excited. I was looking forward to seeing the culture out in Prague. How much of the effects of communism could you still see? How did a city look with many of its buildings still intact after 600 years. What were the shops and people like? How cheap was it, how big is Prague and what was the food like?<\/p><p>The flight across was good. However, it was a little cloudy, so difficult to see much out of the window. Laura squealed as we took off and crushed my right hand at the same time! She didn't take her seat belt off for the whole journey. After an hour and a half we landed at Ruzyne airport which was about 25 miles north west of the city. We were advised not to take a taxi, so we took a bus to Dejvicka which is the end stop on the metro. At this point we didn't know where the hotel was. We eventually found it after talking to a tourist information girl. The big 3 star hotel was 6 or 7 miles north east of the city and placed on the edge of a large estate of flats which lined a long straight road. The flats were grey and ugly and seemed very tatty. Hotel Duo (Teplicka 17), was lilac in colour, with a sports centre, bar and restaurant. We gathered our keys and went to our room on the fifth floor. The room was again lilac with an en-suite. Two beds were joined together to make a double.<\/p><p>After unpacking, we went back into town and landed at St. Wenceslas square. We didn't know that at the time though.

I hadn't realized that she was ill. Auntie Grace to me had always been such a funny, kind lady for whom I'll take away so many fond memories. We used to visit her down in Deal at least once a year. Susan and I would find it boring all the talking she did with dad about family history and what not. Stuff I'd absolutely loved to hear about now. Times in the war. Sadly too young too appreciate. Anyway, Susan and I used to play hockey and golf with the Dixon's walking sticks. Another memory was the outside toilet. The only house I remember with an outside loo.<\/p><p>I can remember the smallest kitchen in the world, the shaking hands when pouring the tea (something Susan suffers with now) and the 'Do you want anymore duck?'. The Dixon's had a chair lift up and down the stairs in their later years which for kids like us provided more entertainment. Those stairs were quite steep though I seem to remember. Grace was a little lady, with a smiley face, white hair and had a great character. First time she saw mum, the first thing she said to her was 'Do you want a bath duck?'. She held quite some knowledge of the family tree. I remember once watching a cine film from the 1930's with Grace and Norman. The event of watching it with them was really funny. Plumes of dust billowed from the projector, Norman not hearing Grace's command to stop and the noise that the projector made was really loud. This is more Norman, but years back we went for a drive with Norman, and he drove so slowly that there was a queue irrate traffic behind him. He continued unflapped and seemingly oblivious to the modern need to rush about. Grace and Norman, I miss you so much. With the inheritance money passed, I bought a picture of two Hurricane's flying over your native London to remind me of you.

The dissertation analyzed the software developer, Michael Jackson's, new way of describing Software Requirements in a structured method. My dissertation has consumed my life for a year or more. I can only describe it to be similar to a best man's speech, where no matter how hard you work at it, it sometimes doesn't come out as intended. It's something that eats at you every spare moment you have. Given the extra pressure of it determining the grade you get and therefore how you are set for the job market, the amount of money you can command, etc. etc.<\/p><p>My vow at the start of the academic year was twofold. One - was to understand everything being taught to me at the time it was taught. This way I would relieve myself of pressure at the end of the year when exams came around. Every other previous academic year I've ever been through, relied on me learning stuff in revision. Revision should be for topping up and refreshing arguments to put into answers, not to try and understand something taught 6 months previous, or for you to rote learn stuff.<\/p><p>Two - Was to work hard at the dissertation early on and not to leave it to the last minute. Unfortunately, I done both. Worked extremely hard at it and left it to the last minute. I remember in the last month or two, just working 12+ hours a day in front of the computer, pruning, adding, adjusting, researching, reading. I think it came to about the week before where I had all the content, but absolutely no structure, or putting my point across to the reader. I panicked severely. I think I was taken to the edge. I remember crying on the phone to Laura one evening whilst she was back in Gravesend, and she drove down (with Charlotte who she was babysitting so to speak) all the way to Bournemouth just for a few hours. I needed her so badly then. I don't think I've needed someone there for me so badly. She was a godsend at the time.<\/p><p>I remember I also poured out to dad my dissertation woes. I went home and he tried to help me sort it out. He even arranged to go and meet his friend from the railway. Although they did not really help directly, I realised I was making things so much more complicated than they were or needed to be. I decided to make it an introduction into Michael Jackson's ideas. My first step was to impose a structure almost a contents page, writing the conclusion first, and leading the reader to that conclusion.

This must have been the first time that I had gone out, where there were more women than blokes, and come to think about it, Steve and Patsy were a bit involved with each other at the time, so it was a bit like me going out with two girls, both very nice, not the usual quality talent that is associated with me. In fact this was so new to me, it was going to be an experience whatever happened. the venue was Ricks Bar, Bracknell, a pub come club type place, mainly used as a starting place before going into the adjoining Masquerades night club.<\/p><p>Now you could view this position in a number of ways. The 'blokes' view would be, no problemo, great opportunity to pull, two attractive single, free girls and me who were coerced to talk with each other. My predicted view would be, I've got no chance, I'm not even going to try, I shall sit in the corner. However, this was not my view for the evening.<\/p><p>I remember the first round of drinks , Steve bought for Patsy and Christie, I think, so a great opportunity to buy Laura a drink. Having bought a lager and bitter and thinking Christie was speaking with her best mate. I thought it a great chance to speak to Laura. Now I know Laura seemed a very outgoing person, which usually scares me, because I'm quiet and boring. However, I was asked about my recent holiday. I was glad to talk about that, it may be a subject that I could actually sound interesting. Ten countries in ten days, explained in 10 minutes. I'd ran out of steam. She seemed to take an interest. I felt so at ease as if we knew each other for a while.<\/p><p>Then as per norm Steve was all over Patsy which left Christie no other choice but to meander her way between Laura and I. I was disappointed and was sure to blow my 'ease' out of the water. I only wanted one girl around and had negative thoughts to an American who seemed just like another teenage girl. Our discussion revolved around the differences with America. I was hoping to continue the flow of the conversation , but the first seeds of my passion to Laura had been sown. Laura did not seem to have minded this intrusion from the foreigner, not that she should have, but I wish she had shown some visual, down cast feelings. The evening flowed on for about 3 hours I suppose, which I had enjoyed immensely, although a little dejected at the end, but I didn't show what qualities I thought I possessed. We left and dropped the Americans off and then finally myself.<\/p><p>Laura sailed off with Steve in his mini, whilst I wished she could of cruised with me for a chat and a laugh. I made Laura my most wanted girl. She had made a mark on me. I assumed it would be another six months before I next saw Laura. I did not have the bottle to ask her out because I thought she would think I was just a nice friend of Stevey's and no more. I had heard of the interest from Laura had created amongst blokes in Brighton. The inexperienced me would not have a chance. However, the Alton Towers trip was arranged later, time to gain my bottle.

Lise, JÃ¸rgen and Mormor all came to wave me off. Did not sleep too well on the way to Berlin. Woke in the middle of the night for the Rostock-&gt;Gedser ferry. It was too hot and uncomfortable and I had chronic hayfever. I woke up at 4:40am and then officially at 6am. I waited for the other four to start showing some life before I dared clamber down from the top bunk. I waited until 6:25 and decided to be brave and be the first to move. I went for a wash... well as much as you can in a train toilet. I did not go back in the cabin. I stayed to look at East Germany for the first time ever. It looked a bit ram shackled and untidy, otherwise it was not too bad. I did see a few\u000a        \u000a    <a href=\"http:\/\/www.trabant.org.uk\/\">\u000a          'trabies'\u000a        <\/a>\u000a        abandoned in back gardens. The trabies looked even worse than I can remember. If Dad were here we would be having a good old laugh. Arr the Minder episode where Arthur imports one. Fantastic.\u000a      <img src='images\\years\\1995\\1995_06_21-Berlin02.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Traubie' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Traubie<\/p><\/p><p>At 6:50am we suddenly hit Berlin. No nice suburbia area, just straight from farmland to an estate of flats. Not very pretty flats at that. The train arrived a few minutes late. I waited for everyone to get out of the cabin so that I could sort my baggage out alone. Thirty seconds later, the SS guard barked at me to get out. Alright calm down I thought. Got out of the train, found a locker for the big red bag and paid my 2DM. Now try and find how to get to the Zoological Garten station so that I can follow the guide in the book.<\/p><p>My hay fever is really affecting me and my right eye is all red. Not a pretty sight. Have not got a clue where I am going and finally after 30 minutes I go and ask at the info desk for what to do. He points me in the right direction. Buy a ticket for 3.70DM but do not know what that entitles me to.<\/p><p>Travelling on the S-Bahn westwards I notice that the train doors are not electronic and can be opened at anytime. Also those German do like to graffiti everything within reach. Arrive at the 'Zoo' in the rush hour. A busy place at the best of times anyway. I did not notice the change from east to west Berlin. From Zoo I follow the guide book. I turn left and make my way towards TiergartenstraÃe. On the way there are about 20-30 police motorcycles gathered outside a hotel along with 5-6 police vans. Flashing lights and sirens. There escorting somebody important but I don't know who.<\/p><p>Get to the quieter area near the woodlands (Tiergarten) and eat some of yesterdays sandwiches. Continue another kilometre to Potsdammer Platz which was supposed to be Berlin's Piccadilly Circus before the war. All there is now is just construction sites, a bit disappointing.<\/p><p>By this time, 9:00am, it is very, very humid. I carry along northwards along 'no manâs land', which is a 75m strip of desolate grassland which is about to be constructed on. Continue to the Brandenburg gate. I have a rest, getting a bit tired and drink and eat some sandwiches. Although there are no gates and no wall to be seen, quite a nice site. To cap it all there was a 'trabi' that stopped underneath the archway. The sad thing was I could not get my camera out in time. Around the Brandenburg gate there were street salesmen selling all sorts of East German memorabilia from bits of wall to the guards hats. Bought a matchbox 'trabie' car for about 5DM.<\/p><p>After the 'gate' I headed towards the Reichstag, the old parliamentary building. It was very busy there and plenty of TV crews. They were covering it up with a silvery colour cloth to protect it. didn't get to see much of that. Had a look at the market stalls just opposite and saw another matchbox 'trabie' for sale at 10DM! Walked east towards the old Eastern side down Unter Den Linden. This is where dear old Adolf used to have his marches. Again this street is under heavy re-development and so was a bit disappointing. Saw the place where the 'book burning' was done and saw 'Bebel Plate'. I needed another rest and sat down to eat and play on the 'Gameboy'. then it started to rain. This was around midday, 1 o'clock. then it started to thunder and lightning. It sounded like the blitz in Berlin with each roll of thunder.<\/p><p>I took relief at the strange , Neue Wache for half an hour. Even though it rained hard it dried off just a bit and I decided to walk to 'Platz de Akademe'. Moral was lower, see all those old buildings and it was raining. I decided a change of scenery so went up the telecommunications tower. A massive tower shadowing East Berlin. Went up it costing me 13DM and had an 8DM pot of hot chocolate in spinning cafe. It completes one revolution every half an hour. The problem was that it was very cloudy and I couldnât see very far. For my Â£10 pot of hot chocolate I decided to stay for 45 minutes. This tower is situated right next to Alexander Platz.<\/p><p>At last I found some shops just by the tower. Could I get a bargain at the presumable cheaper German shops. No! CD's were 33DM (Â£15), computer games 100DM, Trainers and jeans were Â£20 more expensive. Caps were up to 40DM.<\/p><p>About 4:00pm now. Got on a crowded bus to 'Zoo'. I almost got away without paying, but an honest chap like myself went and paid the conductor. The traffic was bad and the weather poor. Saw one of the stadiums and 'SiegeÃade groÃer stern'. A large, impressive statue in the middle of a roundabout. Got off at Zoo and made way for the main shopping street, Kurtustendamm. Not very impressed. Decided to go to the Olympic stadium. So went up Knesebeck StraÃe and get on a train at 'Savigny Platz'.<\/p><p>\u000a        Finally get to the quiet station of 'Olympia Stadia' and made the five minute walk to the\u000a        \u000a    <a href=\"http:\/\/www.olympiastadion-berlin.de\/\">\u000a          Olympic stadium\u000a        <\/a>\u000a        itself. It looked quite impressive. I paid the 1DM at the gate and went inside. Two light roofs at both sides of the straight, and seating all the way around. I went on to the track and field. Would this be allowed at Wembley? From the hub of the city it was nice to be in the peace and quiet. I sat down in the VIP seats, took my shirt off because of the blazing sun, and listened to the world service on my radio, wrote this and played on the Gameboy. I was there for around two hours I really enjoyed it. I was imagining what the 1936 Olympics would have been like with Hitler there. I had not realized that there was an equestrian and swimming centre within the grounds as well. Walked back to the station and took almost the entire length of the U2 U-Bahn line to AlexanderPlatz. Back at Lichtenberg, where I paid 3DM for a can of coke. I telephoned home to say I was still alive. Waited for 2 hours for my train.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\1995\\1995_06_21-Berlin05.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Olympic Stdium' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Olympic Stdium<\/p><p>On the train with four other German speaking men and a women.
