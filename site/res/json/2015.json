A northward journey of about an hour. We parked up around the corner from the pleasure beach. We couldn't believe how long the queues were to get in. Still mystified as to why. 45 minutes. There were lots of staff on the tills.<\/p><p>First ride was on the sedate rocket ride. One of the oldest on the park. Ben and Daddy went on the Ice Blast, the ride that shoots you up 210 feet vertically at an inordinate velocity. Ben was scared. You could tell by the noises that came from him. They weren't from a cool, 'I can handle dad', Ben. We then went on the Grand National, a favourite of mum's. We then split, mummy, daddy and Ben went on Infusion, the vampire equivalent ride, that went upside down and very fast. It felt as if we were in one roll into the next. Again Ben loved it. Not as scary add he thought. Katie and Jess went too Nickelodeon World and went on a Blue Flyer coaster. Then it was time for the Big One.... or Pepsi Max in old money. Daddy was worried. Speed is what does him in these days. Ben sat on the back car with him, with mummy just in front. The long climb up is the worst, followed by arching the summit, the 90 degree twist, then woosshhh. 85mph. Best ride off the day.<\/p><p>So many more rides as the queues were reasonably short. Avalanche, a coaster seemingly not running on rails, a toboggan ride. Revolution, loop the loop backwards and the disappointing  Red Arrows Skyforce ride, where you could control when you went upside down..... except Ben's arms were not long enough to control this! The girls got soaked on the watery Valhalla ride. They were scared stiff as by this time darkness had fallen and the ride was in pitch black going down into water! We ended about 6pm, headed to the nearest chip shop, sort of looked at the illuminations. The traffic awful to drive down the seafront so decided to make the 5 hour journey home.

We had a couple of good tour guides and visited the dressing rooms, 3 areas of the seating, the tunnel, the press conference room, where the directors hang out and sit in the dug out seats. Really good. We loved the 90 minute tour.

This seemed to trip Dawg up the most surprisingly.<\/p><p>After a couple of litres of ale, E'ster and Dawg went back to the hostel for a kip and to put makeup on, whilst the hardcore drinkers moved on to the Hard Rock cafÃ©.... and it was Queen day. Music to Slop's ears. Another beer and a short later and the 3 boys were sold by this a girl a rickshaw ride to Ned Kelly's. What a ride. The poor girl didn't know what had hit her. They shouted out 'Move it or lose it sister' to the unsuspecting public. Plenty of noise. Then Jonah forgot his jumper, so she had to turn back. By the end of the 15 minute journey the girl was out of breathe. She was rewarded well though. The infamous 5 were back together. Ned Kelly's and England v San Marino and another beer. A largely uneventful game, other than the 6 goals that is! Mikey still warming up his drinking arm.<\/p><p>We returned to the Wombats. Slop was in the communal area testing the hammocks out. The opportunity was too great for Bazza who tipped Slop on to his head and dragged him to the side of the hall. Others in the room were horrified. Slop and Bazza were sniggering like little school children. We claimed our free drinks at the Wombats Bar. Bazza tried out a bit of pole dancing.

Others have put it down as 40th birthday celebration! Daddy, Michael, Steven, Nick and Barrie or Slop, E'ster, Dawg, Kingster and Bazza all decided to go to Munich for a long weekend. It started with taxis from Messrs Papa Gay and Papa Barnett. A 6:30am departure for a meet at Heathrow Terminal 2. E'ster having not travelled much did not managed to comprehend that a nearly empty shower gel in a 250ml bottle will not get through security. Despite being told, he tried to sneak it through. He got stopped and had to empty his bag. The hi-jonx had already started. Baz left his e-cigarette pipe thing behind. Fortunately E'ster picked it up. Of course not letting on. We saw Baz running around looking for it.... yes Bazza actually running. He was desperate. Having left his bag unattended, a rummage through the bag saw an interesting pair of shoes which Slop took for later! the first beers were served up at 8am. <\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_09_04-107-MunichTour_Day1_Airport.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='8am beer at Terminal 2' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>8am beer at Terminal 2<\/p><p>Then came the flight....

Then a trolley came around with drinks and food..... Beer number 2. More than one drink could be ordered.... so Slop had a coffee and orange juice. It didn't go too well. The coffee was spilt everywhere! Then Dawg proceeded to spill his beer and Bazza his orange juice on the person sat next to him!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_09_04-200-MunichTour_Day1_Aeroplane.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Plane mess' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Plane mess<\/p><p>Bazza went to the toilet and got stuck between the trolleys going up the gangway. Whilst he was waiting he cheekily asked for another beer!... Unsurprisingly his wish was granted, so was drinking beer at 9am on the gangway. This opened the floodgates for the rest of the plane to order subsequent beers!<\/p><p>On ordering the third beer, E'ster decided to get up and go to the toilet. Shuffling along Slop left his foot out on the gangway which tripped up the air stewardess who was serving the beer. Then E'ster wouldn't take the beer as he got up waiting to get out to the toilet. The male steward then came over, an excused Slop of purposely tripping up the air stewardess. As E'ster didn't take the beer there was a stand off between giving and receiving the beer. It got a bit tense for a bit. We were not ideal passengers I suspect. This coupled with Baz getting his suitcase down for the umpteenth time looking for his e-cigarettes we were right pains in the necks!<\/p><p>We arrived.... first a chance to change footwear...

The room was clean and reasonably spacious. Bazza now lost some additional filters or something. He was all over the place. After the hardship of making our own beds we wandered out to E'sters first stop, Botanischen Garten, a beer garden and our first stiens. Baz could not handle it anymore. He needed nicotine. Just before plundering 10 euros into the cigarette machine, his true whereabouts of his e-cig thing were revealed!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_09_04-300-MunichTour_Day1_BotanischenGarten.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Botanischen Garten' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Botanischen Garten<\/p><p>We caught a tram to Hirschgarten for another beer and some sausage!

Set on the correct road out of Faro, we soon hit a 'road closed' sign. We were forced off onto the local roads. No diversion signs, no map, a choice of two directions running at right angles to the original road. It was literally a coin toss on which way to go. We turned left, eventually saw a town sign, got the mobile phone out and looked at Google Maps to see which way to go. Eventually we re-joined the main road again and headed towards Albuferia.<\/p><woops woopstitle=\"Driving on wrong side of road, two on coming cars and woman trying to undertake!\" rating=\"6\"><p>After over an hours driving we ended up in the jungle of villas to the east of Albuferia. We had a map, no road name. Portugal don't believe in road name signs or town signs. It is always difficult to know where you are. Every road looks to the same, there are no distinguishing features. We were going around in circles in the right area. Anyway after another U-turn in a side road, daddy unconsciously drove in 'English' mode. Was on the left hand side of the road. Turned out of the junction left, continued slow-ish for about 20 yards. All of a sudden, two oncoming cars appear. Ahhh. We're on the wrong side of the road. Without checking, daddy steered right (onto the correct side of the road), however, some woman was trying to overtake, so as we pulled across we cut her up. She slammed her brakes on, tyres squealing on her car, the smell of rubber masked the other smells which may have slipped out! The woman raised her arms in exasperation. Daddy, sheepishly pulled away. I would question why the woman was trying to overtake when she saw a daft foreigner on the wrong side of the road!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_07_28-10-Portugal-Day1.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Driving wrong side of road' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Driving wrong side of road<\/p><p>After Google Maps told us where we were, we quickly found the villa. First we saw a For Sale sign and then what appeared to be locked gates to the property. Phone calls back to England proved unfruitful. Our Portuguese contact did not answer the phone. Oh dear. We've been sold a pup.<\/p><p>Whilst we were climbing \/ playing \/ mucking around with the gate, Katie managed to 'unlock' it. The property from the outside was gorgeous. Next, the front door - locked. The key inside a mini-safe which we didn't have the paperwork for! Suspected that Daddy threw it away. A call back to Gemma and she gave a few numbers to try. BINGO. Key in the door.... still no entry! After a bit of stress and shaking the door (needed a technique) enter Ali Baba. What an ordeal to get to this point.<\/p><\/woops><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_07_28-22-Portugal-Day1.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Casa Tilias Villa' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Casa Tilias Villa<\/p><p>Us youngsters jumped in the pool straight away. How cool and refreshing. Daddy was in charge of inflating bits of PVC. Mummy unpacked. We enjoyed exploring the large villa which looking later was up for sale at Â£450k. Swap houses?<\/p><p>In the evening we decided to venture into Albuferia, about a 10 minute drive away. We really felt on holiday now. Shorts, T-shirt, flip flops and free town parking! Albuferia was a lovely large town. Yes it was 100% aimed at tourists with gift shops and bars, but as long as you had that in mind, it was a lovely setting. No drunks, or beggers or hard salesman. It was reasonably cheap as well, probably due to the strong pound. We decided to stop and eat at a traditional Portuguese eating parlour. Well if Daddy had his way, however it was a Hamburger Restaurant we stopped at. At this point was really suffering in hindsight with exhaustion. It had been a long day, with the heat and the crutches it all took it's toll. Drakness descended and we headed back to the villa for a much needed good night's sleep.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_07_28-15-Portugal-Day1.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Exploring the streets of Albuferia' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Exploring the streets of Albuferia<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Portugal Holiday - Day 1 - Getting there"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":26,"m":7,"y":2015},"datev":20150726,"first":{"value":null},"info":{"content":"<p>Dani, one of Katie's friends who came to her party, invited Katie to her sisters 18th birthday.

Katie was in tears, Mummy laughing in nervousness, Ben and Jess loving the adventure. They were towed to a height of 3000 metres at 70mph.

At times you could feel a gust of wind blow you, or feel a thermal push you up. It was the skill of the pilot to find the thermal, by looking for black clouds or rises from a hill. Daddy had a go on the controls, both steering left and right and controlling the nose pitch. Daddy could see Wycombe, Maidenhead and Stokenchurch quite easily. A house from Grand Designs sunk into the ground was close by as well as the straight stretch of Thames leading to Henley. London could be seen in the distance. Daddy was up in the sky for about 25 minutes before a fast approach to land.

It was pretty hot. We drove up and parked as if we were a normal punter..... seems a long time ago since we lived at Dettingen Park, although it is only 18 months since we moved. Anyway, we headed to the rope over the paddling pool, which all the kiddies wanted to go on. Ben unfortunately of course couldn't do it, but was happy to sit on the camp chair we brought and watch. Joey, Joey's friend Dan, Thomas, Katie, Lily and Jessica all had a go. Joey purposely went in the water and got soaked. Next we queued for a long time at the paintball. Everyone put on the camouflage... a little too much. There were items of clothing that had to go in the bin as it didn't come out! Still the kids loved it..... but then Katie realized she had a party to go to shortly and was then desperate to get it off. Of course whatever queen bee does, all others follow. More baby wipes needed!! A go on the assault course and on the fairground and that's about all we had time for.

Over the past two weeks Ben has been getting more and more anxious about it. How much will it hurt afterwards was the main question. Whilst Daddy stayed at home to get Katie and Jessica to school, Mummy and Ben left at 5:50am heading to Stanmore. The orthopaedic hospital takes patients from all over the south of England. It's the best place to have his leg looked after.<\/p><p>So a reminder of the actual problem. I'm not sure of the technical term. Ben has a malformation of arteries just behind and below the knee. This has resulted in a pool of fluid, be it blood, fat, water meaning that there is pressure on his nerves resulting in him tip-toeing for the past year. Fibrous tissue has been growing as a result further complicating matters.<\/p><p>Mummy and Ben were not long at the hospital before they were called to prepare for the operation which was due shortly. At 8:45 Ben was wheeled into the operating theatre where the main consultant, Mr Pollock greeted him. In all there were 2 consultants, 2 registrars, 2 anaesthetists and 3 or 4 nurses. About 10 health care professionals in all.<\/p><p>Ben was given anaesthetic and put to sleep. The surgeons cut away the fibrous tissue and a slice of muscle, re-routed the veins or arteries and released the fluid. Apparently there will be a 2 inch scare where they entered. A backslab was put on, and loads of bandages. Mummy waited in the chapel and prayed, Daddy arrived from home and joined Mummy.<\/p><p>At 10:45, 2 hours later, Mummy and Daddy were called to the recovery room. As soon as they entered, all they could here were screams and howls of pain. Their fears were realized as they saw Ben in a lot of distress and pain. So much, that his voice was very crackly. The anaesthetist was there along with a nurse. The anaesthetist was trying to get Ben to describe what and where the pain was. Ben was saying that he couldn't move his leg.... and that the cast was digging into him. The anaesthetist said there is not normally this amount of pain. Daddy froze. He was holding Ben's hand, but couldn't speak. He began sweating and the anaesthetist was worried that he'd pass out. Mummy was in a similar state. She had to sit down as she said the room was spinning around. They felt helpless. The anaesthetist was brilliant as he had 3 of us to contend with.... as well as trying to convince a junior member of staff the amount of anaesthetic to inject. Ben was in this very distressed state for 10 minutes until a 'generous' amount morphine, was injected. Ben was still in distress as he slowly fell asleep in the next 5 minutes still complaining about the pain. Mummy and Daddy could breathe again, stand-up and talk. It was hard to take in everything the anaesthetist and one of the surgeons was saying. Basically the operation went to plan. It was hard to say what the medium term effects are going to be. A lot of physio will be required. In the short term, all options are open including going back to re-adjust the backslab or going to HDU. Fortunately he was discharged back to the ward having been asleep for 15 to 30 minutes. Don't really get a sense of time in these situations.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_06_30-01-BensLegOperation.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Wheeled out of recovery by the porters' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Wheeled out of recovery by the porters<\/p><p>He came around slowly in the ward, fortunately not screaming. Not too comfortable, but at least not in great distress. In the next hour or two, progress was fast and good. It still hurt but Ben managed to crack a smile. We were looked after by the Sister, a physiotherapist came around to give Ben his crutches, which he had been asking for on countless occasions. Eager to get on. Ben didn't like the catheters and drain in him and wanted to get them off soon. He tried eating some bread, but his throat hurt too much and was unable to swallow. This is probably because a fat tube is put down the throat in order to get the airwaves open in theatre. However, he managed some strawberry ice cream and a little later some chocolate. They could take off his catheter as he proved he was not going to be sick. He then could try the crutches out. <\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_06_30-02-BensLegOperation.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Still drowsey coming back from theatre' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Still drowsey coming back from theatre<\/p><p>Well we could see that Ben does not realize how careful he has to be.

A pair of mountains, Quinag and Spidean Coinich hugged the road as it wound all the way up to the summit. A period of flat before descending to Loch Assynt and a stop off at Ardvreck Castle. This was Nick and Michael's favourite section of the holiday.<\/p><p>Ardvreck Castle provided a physical challenge. A jump across the water to the Castle which sat on an island in the loch. All in all, everyone got a wet foot, although no one seemed to admit it. The boys mucked about in the castle for a bit. Again time was marching on. They had progressed even slower than yesterday!

His hands were absolutely freezing and stung so badly as he raced down Bettyhill. The gloves helped insulate against the wind chill and wet. A lifesaver. Michael had the luxury of plastic bag socks!<\/p><p>The three were soon into one of the biggest hills of the trip, climbing up into no mans land, aka Borgie. The wind was blowing really hard. It was a struggle to go down hills. Tongue was bypassed in favour of a costal shortcut across the Kyle Of Tongue bridge. Again spectacular landscape, with people fly fishing in the estuary. Past the bridge, an even bigger hill, which required a stop at the top and a well deserved egg and bacon sandwich. Only a third of the distance covered, it was going to be a long day. As they were cycling into the wind, they could see the weather ahead of them.

The 21 miles to Durness sign was passed  - no one dared stop. It was a case of getting to any form of shelter. Soon a disused church was found in Eriboll. Daddy went to open the door.... It was like the 64 million dollar question.... there was suspense - drum roll please. Was it going to be open? No, it was locked.

Shivering through the door, a round of teas and cakes were ordered as they stripped off their wet clothes and sidled up to the heaters to dry out tops, socks and gloves. The weather passed and the troops climbed out of their bunker to hit the north coast run into Durness stopping at some lovely Atlantic scenes.

They all stopped in the middle of the road, with no shelter, and turned their backs against the horizontal deluge of ice from the sky! Daddy found it tough going. Amazingly earlier in the day, proper athletes ran a marathon along this very route. They must have gone faster than what the boys were achieving.

There was just an hour to eat the Smoked Salmon and Scrambled Egg breakfast and take in the views before getting off at Inverness. The boys had a couple of hours to kill, so a quick look at Trip Advisor and a Bike CafÃ© was located and the second breakfast order went in. It was a strange setup. The cafÃ© had the most limited range of food; toast, cake, Granola or fruit. The bike part of the cafÃ© constituted a room around the back, where a job interview was taking place. Daddy chuckled as the toilet was right next to the interview - chemical warfare was declared. I wonder how many interviews had been infected with that before? Nick went to buy a much needed jacket which would turn out to be one of his best purchases in a long while.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_05_15-00-Scotland-Day1-LairgToFarr.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Route' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Route<\/p><p>12:30 and the train rolls into Lairg from Inverness. Finally biking can commence. Today a 49 mile trek northwards. The boys started off confidently, Daddy only wearing the Rockets top. There was a tail wind which made the climb very easy. They were all wondering what the fuss was about. Mountains were seen in the distance. The road was long and reasonably straight, interrupted by the odd cattle grid and speeding motorist. It was a joy to ride. The weather soon turned. A jacket and thick biking top was needed over the Rockets top to stave off the drop in temperature and rain. Thankfully, the Altnaharra Hotel was the boys saviour. A warm chocolate cake and good cup of tea soon perked up the chaps. One cake soon turned into two. The carrot cake was almost as good as the chocolate. Sometimes the thick accent was hard to understand on the friendly and chatty locals, many of whom seemed to have worked south west of London!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_05_15-11-Scotland-Day1-LairgToFarr.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Nick and Daddy heading north' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Nick and Daddy heading north<\/p><p>A turn to the right at the crossroads and the boys continued north along Loch Naver and the River Naver. Birds of prey were spotted. Claims of it being an eagle were a little dubious. The Loch turned into a river which was followed all the way to the coast. A race to the top of the next hill materialized with a point being awarded to the polkadot champ. About a dozen hills were tackled before reaching the mouth of the river on the north coast. Then Mr King and Mr Elder were in a no holds barred race to the top of Bettyhill. Nick raced ahead. Michael came up on the inside. Sensing the danger, Nick 'closed' the space. Michael forged ahead and try to bulldoze through. Nick slammed the door shut, bolted it and threw away the key. BANG. A clash of metal. Both cyclists ended up in the middle of the road on the floor claiming it was each others fault. It just so happened the only two yobbos in north Scotland were hanging out in the bus shelter absolutely besides themselves with laughter. A chant of 'She fell over' echoed over the crash scene. Daddy was in stitches having a grandstand view 20 metres behind.<\/p><p>Fortunately there was no serious damage. A graze to ones skin, bike and pride was about the sum of it. The toughest two miles of biking was still to come to end the day's riding. First passing an open fish and chip shop without going in was hard, then some proper up hill gradients were experienced out of Bettyhill towards Farr. They arrived about 6:30pm at Farr Cottage and was welcomed by Lesley.<\/p><p>Three hungry boys sat down at the dinner table to the best fish pie ever, consisting of salmon, haddock, cod, hard boiled egg, potato and cheese sauce followed by rhubarb crumble. Lesley was relaying tales of past customers, local MPs help, drug running and the northern lights. An interesting lady. The views over Farr Bay into the distance along the coast line were stunning.

There was nervousness whether they'd all done enough training for the trip.<\/p><p>Thursday, after Michael stopped laughing at Daddy's rack mount, an hour before departure from our house, Jonah rings to say the traffic is terrible and he's going to struggle to make it for the latest leaving time! Before we even start the Jonah strikes. Farfar, the taxi driver, was able to pick him up en-route, through rush-hour traffic to Euston station with bikes strapped to the back of the car. Nick basically spent 4 hours getting from Reading to Euston. As a last minute choice, the boys decided to upgrade to first class sleeping accommodation. They were pushed for time which was made worse by the later than expected arrival and the need to pick up the tickets from an unhelpful man behind the desk. He remarked 'your train is about to leave' as he glanced at his watch. Such an insight to our time pressure was not appreciated as Daddy grabbed the tickets and marched with purpose to Coach J where the bikes were to be stored for the next 11 hours and 500 miles.<\/p><p>Settling into the sleeping compartment, Daddy was relieved they were under way. A tour of the longest train in the world was required, in search for the luxurious 'lounge car' which was advertised on Caledonians website. They walked miles it seemed with no luck. When challenged as to the whereabouts of the car, the barman was dismissive and said that it was different rolling stock to the one currently used. Ahhh. The poorer version the boys were standing in was fully occupied. So there was no choice but to take the beers back to the sleeping compartment and chill. Daddy and Michael's rooms had interconnecting doors, which once opened were open for good, much to Michael's horror when Daddy wanted the blind left open all night! It's like someone shining their full beam headlights into your eyes was the remark. Sleep was hard to come by. Sanity was also slowly slipping away as Daddy became really anxious about the train crashing. He was bracing himself around every corner, thinking they were going on two wheels and over every set of points. What would happen if the wheels did not align properly on the tracks and we left the rails at such high speed? Tiredness fortunately prevailed and broken sleep was attained for the best part of the journey north.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_05_14-05-Scotland-Day0-TrainToInverness.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='First Class Sleeping Compartment' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>First Class Sleeping Compartment<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Day 0 - Scotland Biking - Train from Euston"},"version":5},{"date":{"d":10,"m":5,"y":2015},"datev":20150510,"first":{"value":null},"images":1,"info":{"content":"<p>Daddy went on a final training test run with all the kit.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_05_12-01-LondonBikeRide.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Oh dear - netting tangled in wheel' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Oh dear - netting tangled in wheel<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"London Bike Ride"},"version":5},{"date":{"d":9,"m":5,"y":2015},"datev":20150509,"first":{"value":null},"images":5,"info":{"content":"<p>We decided to go for a new course today, Thames Valley Park, Reading.

He was over the moon to get a bag of actual shrapnel from the war.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_03_29-15a-WWI-France-Day2-Albert.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Fresco in Albert' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Fresco in Albert<\/p><p>All indoor events so far, and although the weather was still terrible we were all itching to get out and see where the big battles occurred. We headed to the nearby Thiepval, where there was some heavy fighting and many casualties, especially on the first day of the Battle Of The Somme, July 1st 1916. There are many good accounts on YouTube. Anyway there was another museum and memorial. A modern museum which we rounded. We went to the memorial on top of the hill. It was hard to take the significance of it all, as the wind was absolutely blowing so hard. It started to blow the wreaths off that had been laid many months before. We had to quickly retreat back to the car.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_03_29-23-WWI-France-Day2-Albert.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Thiepval memorial' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Thiepval memorial<\/p><p>We drove around where the front lines were. All farms. We went passed the first place where tanks were ever used in battle, in 1918. The landscape looked pretty unscathed, we couldn't see mud and trenches, except from one place, the Lochnagar Crater. We visited this. The British tunnelled under no man's land and planted explosives which when detonated could be heard in London it is reported. It made a whacking great hole on July 1st. Quite impressive.<\/p><p>The weather and our stomachs were beating us, so we headed back into Albert, found a restaurant and had dinner. Well sort of. Daddy, ever the adventurous one order a tripe sausage. It was disgusting. The smell was the worst thing, which didn't help eating the rest of the meal. The burger that Ben order was smothered in cheese, which he didn't like. Still he ate most of the rest of it. Farfar had some duck.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_03_29-02-WWI-France-Day2-Albert.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Albert Centre' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Albert Centre<\/p><p>A long day, ended in the room at the B and B.

Ben read his Harry Potter book for most of the way. We stopped at Maidstone for a Costa and a stretch of the legs. Dover was packed out with lorries and many cars. There were over 200 lanes to queue for the ferry. We boarded and left of time.<\/p><p>The journey was a bit roly-poly, but a fried breakfast soon helped settle the stomach. There was a thick fog also, which meant we couldn't see much when we went out on deck. The captain was blowing the horn every 2 minutes, I guess as a way of saying, 'I am here, get out of my way'.<\/p><p>We crossed the busiest shipping lanes in the world unscathed, and we were on French soil. First stop was the 90 minute car journey to Agincourt. The place where we gave the arrogant French a punch on the nose. As we passed through the many villages we all noticed the lack of life. We barely saw a person walking on the pavement, riding a bike or anything really. It was quite eerie. They were ghost towns. Agincourt was a tiny village which had a modern museum in it's centre. Again, we were the only customers in the museum, so had the place to ourselves. Basically the French thought they'd destroy Henry V's army as they returned to England. Aware of this, Henry set a mini trap, funnelling the vast quantities of French infantry and cavalry through the mud which our long bowman exploited. Ben seemed to absorb much of the information. He enjoys learning about things like this. The museum had a miniature scene which helped us visualize the battlefield. It had armour, weapons and some short films which we watched. We were there for about 90 minutes before moving on to circling the battlefield which is now a farmers field.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2015\\2015_03_28-21-WWI-France-Day1-Agincourt.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Agincourt Museum - Armour' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Agincourt Museum - Armour<\/p><p>The battlefield now just looks like any other field.

Sobering.<\/p><p>Late afternoon and we arrived at our B and B, which was in fact a farm with a number of rooms. We were right at the top. A modest sized room. Ben and Daddy shared the double bed, and Farfar the small bed at the side. We had been picking at food all day long, so we were not particularly hungry. After Daddy thrashed Ben at a number of games of table football, we retired to watch some French TV. Fortunately there was an African international game on.

However, the gel I took, kicked in and along with some jelly babies which were handed out, I was back in the land of living and ready to kick on. 1 hour 30 mins at mile 10, and Lee and I were on a mission. We passed loads of people, no one passed us. Daddy thought he had stolen an unassailable lead. However, with 400 metres to go Lee nonchalantly zoomed passed.

Let's get trading. But into what? Well the decision was made to bet against the Euro. The recent 1.1 trillion pumped into quantative easing, making exports more attractive was weakening the currency. Conversely, quantative easing in the US had just finished and an announcement that interest rates are set to rise has meant that bonds are more attractive making the dollar stronger.<\/p><p>So to the trading platform, Barclays Stockbrokers, and first up I am bamboozled by the units, 1,10,25,50,100. Still now I am not sure what they represent, but eventually I plump for going short on the Euro by 100. Immediately I am Â£300 down just on the spread price. Within minutes that is recovered and things look good. Up a 100, 500, 1000 pounds all quite quickly. In fact by the end of the day I've 'made' Â£6,500! Not bad for a day's work. The proceeding day also a good one. Up to Â£12000. Wednesday went nuts. At one point mid-morning I was up Â£24,000.... In two a half days trading. This was the high point. I think I eventually sold at a profit of Â£18,0000. Over the next couple of days it ebbed and flowed, fininshing the week on a Â£10,000 profit.... which in one respect is disappointing looking at what could have been, but on the other hand it is Â£10000 more than I had the previous week, which you can complain about.<\/p><p>So I have learnt a great deal of lessons over the week. First, it's no good putting in so much money, such that in an hour your profit\/loss varies by Â£7000 in an hour! For one it is not good for the heart, secondly it is too short term as a downward turn can trigger the margin limit and an automatic sell, even though you know it is a temporary blip.<\/p><p>Two, deffo only put in, what you can afford to lose.... I was incredibly lucky and went in at the right moment. If I was looking at a Â£5000 loss, then what would Laura think. What would Ron think. He worked hard for that money and I just waste it in days. It needs to be respected. It is so easy to fall into a computer game mode, where you don't see the money physically, it's just considered monopoly money.<\/p><p>Gambling and greed, or considered investment and the want to capitalize. A fine line. I questioned myself a lot over the week. How much was enough? Why did I feel quite low, despite getting a healthy profit? Was it right to using this money in this way? Questions I still not sure I know the answer to.<\/p><p>Market downturn why? I am not sure for the past 5 trading days since, the dollar has got stronger. There does not seem to be any news to explain this.... I can understand a 1 day blip, but 5 days? What does the future hold for the currency? The love affair with this is over. Did I invest a bit too long in this because I had nothing else to jump to. Really I need a portfolio of stuff. Don't get emotionally attached.

This time he was going to go under a general anaesthetic and have a biopsy done at the back of his right knee. Having woken at 5am and left at 5:35am we made it in good time. No traffic really. Various staff came around and ask questions, talked through the procedure, all very nice. Mummy was very anxious and could only be involved sometimes. Daddy was there also to help me through.<\/p><p>We had some time to kill so Ben and Daddy went to the Day Room and played some pool. This was Ben's first attempt.... and of course he is as cack-handed as his father. After a bit of practice, Ben was getting the hang of it. We had company and a teenager called Michael played against Ben and Daddy. We got to the end stages and Ben was called in. Some anaesthetic cream was applied and cling-filmed down. At the last minute, we were told to go to the ultra sound department. This sent Mummy into meltdown as this was not the plan. Daddy and Ben saw a senior radiologist who was very nice and examined Ben's leg again. He managed to diagnose the problem in 10 minutes. Why the previous ultra sound didn't show the same issue is another question. The doctors notes say:<\/p><ul><li>arteriovenous malformation<\/li><li>contains fat and blood vessels<\/li><li>no focal mass<\/li><li>partially compressible<\/li><\/ul><p>So main thing he said it was not cancerous. Mummy found us and gave Kumar, the radiologist and big hug. She was so relived. He said we could go home. No biopsy needed.<\/p><p>So, as Ben has mummy and daddy wrapped around his little finger, we went to the new McDonalds in Farnborough which had tablets at every table. Ben had two burgers!
