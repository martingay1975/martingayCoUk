It took 50 minutes to get to Havant where we started our ride. We met up with Jon Cooper. This charity event had about 120 riders of which 90% seemed serious or club riders. We departed at 7:50. After 3 or 4 miles I decided that I wanted to push away from the other 2 as I fancied keeping up with the club riders, which I did for a few miles.... then my chain looped in a couple of places and had to stop to my extreme annoyance for 3 or 4 minutes. I expected the other 2 to pass me, but they didn't. I continued solely but got lost from West Meon. I ended up close to Droxford. Having gone 5 or 6 miles out of my way I met up with Jon (who was on his way back) and Paul at the half way stage. I took on some much needed food and drink. I was determined to try and catch Jon up, although I went with Paul for the first 3 or 4 miles, which meant walking up some hills. Jon must have been 45 minutes ahead by now and so gave up hope passing him. I cycled on my own for all the way back, only passed by 3 or 4 club riders who were going impressively fast. My bike was a cheap wreck. I couldn't get to the bottom 7 or 8 gears nor the top 3 or 4. As a result I really struggled up the hills. I also struggled down them with less than adequate brakes! The hill at Exton was memorable, not only for its size, but because I had climbed it when I went wrong the first time round! One I would like to re-visit.<\/p><p>Quatre past two, I ambled back to the finish line. I was starving. I was surprised not to see Jon. Both he and Paul got lost and so all ended up doing closer to 70 miles. I waited half an hour for Jon and one and a half hours for Paul. I felt surprisingly fit after the ride. An hour later and I could do everything again.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/1998\/1998_09_27-Laura.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Laura in my bedroom' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Laura in my bedroom<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"100km Bike Ride - Havant"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":26,"m":9,"y":1998},"datev":19980926,"info":{"content":"<p>We had a lie in, before retrieving our cars from Fleet.

I got some 1831 aftershave, a radio, Only Fools and Horses (series 2) and The Spy Who Loved Me. A pair of shorts, and the 'Best Anthems In The World' album, a cocktail shaker, a glass, some chocolates, an Eric Cantona book, a tennis racket and some other nik-naks. I got around a dozen cards. We went to work as usual, but I had a half day.<\/p><p>We headed down towards Hayling Island and met up with Helen and Nigel in a pub. Spent the evening down at Haven.<\/p><p>After dinner we went to Helen and Nigel's chalet and had birthday cake and presents from Laura's family. They all sang happy birthday, which was nice. We went off to play snooker, whilst having quite a few bevies. The cabaret, after, we had another 7 odd pints. Finally I tried to down half a pint which I succeeded for 5 seconds ...... but then threw back up into the pint glass it had just came out of. I then tried to drink this!!! but luckily was stopped. I then placed the glass strategically where Laura's mum was. She wasn't looking and picked the glass up thinking it was her drink. Again luckily it didn't go any further, but she wasn't too happy. What a great son-in-law I am. We then went to Hudson's for a bit more drinking and dancing.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/1998\/1998_07_10-Haven02.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='At Haven, Hayling Island' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>At Haven, Hayling Island<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"My 23rd Birthday - Haven"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":5,"m":7,"y":1998},"datev":19980705,"images":1,"info":{"content":"<p>Laura and Steve had another appointment to see a house in Cove again.

Laura slept a lot of the time whilst me and Steve went swimming in the 'med' as Laura called it. The water was green and both of us took a few mouthfuls. Although it was overcast, it was quite warm.

It was still semi-light. We headed towards the bar (drinks) marquee, which was extremely busy. We then headed towards the big top which was huge, circus sized. It had the atmosphere of a night club. Many were wearing fancy dress which I thought was excellent and really in the spirit of the party. We danced the night away. Me and Lau didn't really know anyone else there. Later on we all went around the fairground bit and had a laugh. We continued to dance until around 3am, when it was time to depart for the bus back to the beach for the 'survivors' photo.

It was a really hot day and it was very relaxing walking in the sun. We caught a bus to Fulham Broadway and began to make our way by foot to the Kings Road, via Chelsea FC. There were many antique shops, but wasn't until we reached a mile or so up that we saw the hub of the Kings Road. We walked and eventually ended up Sloane Square by about 5 or 6 o'clock. We bought some magazines and sat in the square reading them for 45 minutes. It was nice to stop and have a break. We caught the tube to Piccadilly Circus and briefly went in the Rain Forest Cafe. It was somewhere to come back to at a later date. We popped over to the Burlington Bertie for a couple of hours. We then walked through Soho to the Topo Gigio restaurant and almost sat in the same place as 2 years previous. I had raw beef and wild boar. The beef was great. Want to try that again. A lovely evening. Anyway we caught the tube back to Chiswick and drove us home.<\/p><p>We went back to Top Gigio again for a nice Valentines meal.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/1998\/1998_02_14-TopoGigioBrewerSt.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Valentineâ€™s Day in London' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Valentineâ€™s Day in London<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Valentineâ€™s Day"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":13,"m":2,"y":1998},"datev":19980213,"info":{"content":"<p>We went out with the boys to the Litten Tree and Joe Banana's.<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Camberley Night Out"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":7,"m":2,"y":1998},"datev":19980207,"info":{"content":"<p>Went to Maidstone, Fireman's Party, and go karting<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Maidstone, Fireman's Party, Karting"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":2,"m":1,"y":1998},"datev":19980102,"first":{"value":null},"images":3,"info":{"content":"<img src='images\/years\/1998\/1998_01_XX-GaysBackGarden.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='In Mum and Dadâ€™s back garden' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>In Mum and Dadâ€™s back garden<\/p><img src='images\/years\/1998\/1998_01_XX-IsteadRiseWithCharlotte.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Martin playing with Charlotte' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Martin playing with Charlotte<\/p><img src='images\\years\\1998\\1998_XX_XX-Spring01.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Less said the better' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Less said the better<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Photo's"},"version":2}],"version":-1373298140}
