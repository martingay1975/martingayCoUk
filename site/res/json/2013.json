We opened the present from Uncle Ron, which was a lovely big telescope which was extremely kind of him.

Work had a power cut for most of the day and the river had burst it's banks and flooded the road.<\/p><p>In the morning Daddy spent an hour and a half onto Talk Talk trying to get the internet connection sorted out. It was now 3 weeks in the new house and still no connectivity. He was fobbed off again with 3 different explanations as to the problem.<\/p><p>The rest of us were getting really excited about Christmas. Ben was more hyper than the other two.We played games for most of the day.<\/p><p>In the afternoon we went around to the Fars for the traditional fare of a Danish Christmas. First up a treasure hunt which Farfar thought would be a lot more challenging than it turned out to be. The children each won Â£10. I think this is one of their favourite gifts. Not sure why. I think it is the power of choice of what to purchase. They still need to respect money a little more and keep it safe. Katie has no concept of saving either. She wanted to go shopping to spend her money. When asked what she wanted to spend it on, she didn't really know. It was the fact that she could hand it over to the shop keeper I think thrilled her.<\/p><p>Auntie Susan and Graham arrived soon after and we sat down at about 5pm for the feast. This year the food was cooked as good as it can get. The pork was amazing. New secret weapon apparently is the 'cooking bag'. Need to try that out. Daddy again went for being fatty of the year, having double helpings for about everything..... and he found the nut in the riselamange!<\/p><p>Us children had chippolates, but steal a bit of crackling off the pork<\/p><p>After food and washing up we played the 'dice game'. A variant on the 'Chinese auction'. We had good fun at that.<\/p><p>Then came the main event. Us children had already been casing out the presents beforehand. Ben was the main organiser and distributor. He was turning more Weston-like in his methods. In the good old days there was only one present being opened at any one time. Ben's decided to give people their presents in batches, so there would be 3 or 4 people opening their queue of presents at any one time. Ben could not understand any other way when told to slow down.<\/p><p>We got through the present opening in about 45 minutes we would say. I think everyone was pleased with their haul. Katie received a magic box set which Uncle Graham and Katie went through and tried a few tricks on us. We ended the evening at about 9pm and returned home. Not too sure how much sleep we got that night. There must have been a period between 11pm and 2am when we actually slept solidly. Jessica said she couldn't get to sleep as Father Christmas had put too many presents on her bed!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2013\\2013_12_24-38-ChristmasEve.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Presents all opened' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Presents all opened<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Christmas Eve"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":23,"m":12,"y":2013},"datev":20131223,"first":{"value":null},"images":2,"info":{"content":"<p>It was incredibly wet outside and when Daddy turned up straight from work we wondered if he had been dragged through a puddle he was so wet.

Of course, Daddy took the cheaper option and decided that we should move all our stuff rather than get removal men in. Over the past 2 or 3 weeks we've been boxing up and trying to find somewhere appropriate to store the boxes. The garage has been filled for weeks. Katie's bedroom was used as a store room after the bed had been dismantled. All in all, the house was looking pretty uninhabitable for the past few days.<\/p><p>In today's crack squad we had Daddy, Mummy, Farfar, Uncle Peter, Pop Pop and Uncle Michael. A few of them were here the night before filling the Luton up with it's first load.<\/p><p>Mr and Mrs Reeve were still packing and clearing up when Daddy knocked on the door at the agreed 9:30 and basically was not allowed back again until 11-ish.

Luckily the weather was dry, but windy and threatening clouds above. At least it wasn't too cold.<\/p><p>After shifting the first load, we went back for a second, this time with some of the larger items.

The funniest bit is when Farfar reversed the Luton into Pop Pop's car. Not much damage done thankfully.<\/p><p>The light was drawing in, the rain started, so there was a bit of a rush to get all the stuff into the house. Most of it was just dumped into the conservatory, awaiting Mummy and Daddy to sort it all out over the next few days and weeks.<\/p><p>One by one people departed. The Fars stayed around for the prize fish and chip dinner, although this time it was an Indian and Chinese takeaway.<\/p><p>Whilst all this fun was happening Ben was at Jaspers, Katie at Nina's and Jessica helping out.

First roller-coaster that could be seen was the Sonic Pinball. Like a Waltzer car on a roller coaster. This was really good Katie and Ben were a little scared which was good. Jessica and Mummy went on some of the smaller rides, but Jessica is not satisfied with piddly, little roundabouts any more. No she has to take Daddy on the Enterprise. A super fast, upside down big wheel type ride. She absolutely loved it, where as Daddy was thinking it went too fast, too much upside down and what it was doing to his stomach!!! Again, again. Mummy had the dubious pleasure next turn. Ben went on Submission, his favourite ride as it also went upside down. It was like a flying carpet ride but set at all different angles for the rider. Katie got quite scared on some of the scary, ghost train type rides. She hated Hex, which the rest of us liked. It was certainly different. You are placed in a room. You sit down and you are made to feel that you are spinning around the room. Very good.<\/p><p>We tried to get on the ride called Thirteen, or Th13teen. However, it was shut which was disappointing. We did Blade, the teacup ride, the driving experience, the chair-o-plane, the traditional roundabout, Ice Age 4D, which was different again. A film which had live effects like snow and bubbles raining down, wind and even things smacking the backs of your legs! Towards the end of the day we went on the water rides much to Daddy's protests! First up the log flume which we got very wet on. Next the pirate boat ride which was awesome (especially if it was hot). Each of the pirate boats had about 10 cannons which you could fire water from. People on the side of the ride could fire at them with their own cannons. Anyway Ben got soaked, but he loved it! The final water ride was the tyre ride down the rapids which again we got wet! Daddy had one final go on Rita, which was rapid and made especially better as he sat at the front!

There were some Chilean football supporters there who we had some photos taken with. They were mad. We checked out of our hotel in the afternoon and made our way to Lise and JÃ¸rgen's who had also prepared some food for us.<\/p><p>It was nice to see Lise again after all her health issues she had been having for the past 12 months plus.

After having a go on the local playground we headed towards the Little Garden restaurant.<\/p><p>Well Daddy certainly filled his guts here.

However, we did spot a bakers shop which pleased us. Anyway we caught the 1A and 3A bus past JÃ¸rgen's old hairdressers shop to Valby Park, another location that Daddy hadn't visited before. There was just another unique playground with hills and towers to climb as well as animals carved from wood it seemed. After a long play we walked down to the water's edge and paddled in the water before returning through some interesting gardens back onto the bus and train, home to our hotel.<\/p><p>Then comes the highlight of the holiday for us children; Tivoli. First up is the 100 year old rollercoaster called Rutschebane. Everyone liked this one, and it was Daddy's old favourite. Jessica especially liked it and wanted to go on it again and again. She must have had 10 rides on it in the end.<\/p><p>We went on so many rides, like the Aquila, Ben's first ever upside down ride as he puts it, the Star Flyer, a glorified chair-o-plane ride, which we all found extremely scary as the ride broke down the first time we were on it. It goes very high and there was a fair wind. Daddy doesn't mind admitting he was hanging on in there a bit. Got the heart pumping.<\/p><p>We won a Toblerone on the bike game, had 45 minutes of fun in the fun house. We met up with Fars later in the afternoon, they even had a go in the fun house! We got out of the park for some much needed food at Jensens BÃ¸fhus, before returning again for a belly-testing load of rides. The one unique aspect of Tivoli is the fact it opens to late at night and the appearance of the park changes, there are a lot of pretty lights.<\/p><p>Katie's favourite ride was the Drop Tower, Daddy's was the boating lake, Mummy's the Demon roller-coaster ride which was spectacular at night, Ben's the upside-down ride and Jessica the Rutschebane.

The park has to be 4 square miles so Daddy was stressing a bit in order to find it in time for the traditional 9am start. We were greeted with others who were also attending and met up with a couple of other English families who were running. We didn't set the world alight, but the course was very nice and we got the same warm, friendly atmosphere as we do in Frimley Lodge.<\/p><p>After the boiling hot run we bussed it over to Copenhagen Zoo. Mummy remembered from her previous trip how good it was and was not disappointed this time either.  One of the first things up was the polar bear enclosure. We could go underground and see them playing under the water. It was quite a site to look up and see a polar bear swimming just above us. A huge, heavy thing like that able to not sink to the bottom. Amazing.<\/p><p>What we liked about the zoo, as Mummy says, there is no rubbish animals, and the fact they all seemed to be fairly active, no lying around, sleeping. We saw lions, elephants being feed, a group of 7 tigers playing, monkeys swinging around and being pickles, giraffes, Mummy's favourite, the Tasmainian Devil, snakes, crocs, brown bear, all sorts. We had a lovely day there.<\/p><p>On the way home we walked into Hamley's and had another go around the toys to play with, and sneaked another McDonalds.

We finally arrived going the scenic route. We have been so impressed with the parks in Copenhagen. They are all completely different. This one is actually supervised and managed as it has a lot of play equipment such as trikes and scooters. There was even a table football game which was good, as all 5 of us joined in. A small thing like that is just a nice memory of our holiday. We spent almost a couple of hours there before returning to the hotel for a spot of lunch and to pick our swimming gear up. Next stop Islands Brygge.<\/p><p>We of course walked there which took us half an hour. The weather was good and the lido was busy. It had some diving platforms from a carved ship's hull. We loved it, especially Jessica, a real water baby. She lasted longer than any of us. Some of us had a go of the diving platforms. None of us where particularly brave on that front. It was a really good setup. The coldness set in a bit which put us off from staying in too long. After a spot of sunbathing, we got changed and walked south along the water's edge. We stopped off to watch a game of kayak polo. Looks like they were having a lot of fun playing that game, although some foul play was at hand. All in good humour and spirit though. We continued till one of the new bike bridges which we crossed to Fisketorvet.<\/p><p>We caught a train out to Flintholm, then the Metro back into town where we splashed out on a Jensens BÃ¸fhus meal.

I know, its shocking. The rain had subsided and we continued onto the picturesque Nyhavn where we saw the royal band march through the streets, the Royal Palace (Amalienborg), the Gefion Fountain, the Kastellet Fort and of course the Little Mermaid. A lot of walking so far, and the weather was inclement. We had still plenty more walking to do. Across to two parks. The first was Ãstre AnlÃ¦g where we played loads in the playground. Next was FÃ¦lledparken Park which was very cool; from the tower playground, to the biggest skate park you'll ever likely to see and the traffic playground where a mock road system was been created with real traffic lights and road crossings. We had a great time playing all over this park. We were dead on our feet. We caught the bus back to NÃ¸rreport and stopped in an excellent Pizzaria that Katie especially loved.

Tight wad Daddy wasn't prepared to spend $80 on parking at the airport, so devised a scheme which involved looking at street view and the local bus timetables for 5am in the morning! We cruised through Gatwick, changed some money, bought books, and then looked at the departure boards only to notice that our gate had closed! Oh no. The sprint was on. Was the gate a million miles away as it always tends to be? No, fortunately. They were still queueing to board.<\/p><p>This was Jessica's first ever plane journey.

We were finally prized away and made our way to the Kings Garden where we played in the sandpits. The weather was gorgeous and there were a lot of students socializing.

They're an unfriendly bunch.<\/p>\u000a<p>We had some busy 70mph dual carriageways to negotiate where Nick's lights fell off his bike.

We came across a car parked up on the side of the road. She looked like a hooker. Cleaning the inside of her car down. Something very dubious happened there. Still we got a photo just in case we needed to provide evidence!<\/p>\u000a<p>We stopped off at another top notch patisserie for some lunch. Super high quality. We rolled up the hill to the iconic Arc De Triomphe. I set the challenge to cycle around the 10 lane roundabout. Steve didn't fancy it, he instead got accosted by beggars who had a curious scheme which we still cannot work out. They would drop a ring in front of you making it seem that it was yours. They would then try and give it to you. Then What? Dumbfounded.<\/p>\u000a<p>After circling the Arc a few times, we headed down the very bumpy, cobble stoned Champs-Elysee.

First stop was a beer at the end of the road, then a walk to the Sacre Cour, where Steve made friends again with beggars and was called 'strong man' as he tried to get away from the grabbing man. We went in the impressive, grand cathedral. The views were magnificent. Steve was gasping for a beer. After doing a few laps we ended up in a bar opposite the Moulin Rouges for a 20 euro round of alcohol much to my disgust.<\/p>\u000a<p>Sitting in the sun watching the world go by on the street was very nice. After a frogs legs dinner we hit the metro and waited to see if Steve was going to deliver the promised 'good night out'. He researched by googling 'Where Single Girls Hang Out Paris'. Brilliant. Only the Dawg. We were worried at first as there wasn't too much around, and then we hit Rue Oberkampf. This was very busy. We hit a bar and convinced Steve to climb the stairs that led to the ceiling. Doh!<\/p>\u000a<p>We then went to '114' which had dancing..... a dancing Steve and I. There was a dj spitting out euro music. Nick was not a dancer and so went off for an explore.... and not seen again by the other two for another3 hours!

It was 3am.<\/p>\u000a<p>Meanwhile Nick, who had lost his map, not remembered a phone charger or the name of the hotel was lost! He followed others to the 'centre' where ever that was, but soon lost them. Not sure on the order of these events, but he trod in dog poo, attempted to help a man who was worse for wear, then was sick over Nick's shoes (he had no socks on either). Yuk. He also needed the toilet! Still worse was to come after he eventually found the hotel and began to wash the sick out. After settling down and getting some much needed sleep, Steve decided to hop into Nicks bed and 'spoon' him. Nick, startled, told Steve politely to bugger off.

No cars.<\/p>\u000a<p>It was interesting to see how we would fair after the long ride yesterday. We certainly weren't the freshest. The ride was getting a bit monotonous in the end. Same path, same scenery. Nick, with 2 miles to go decided to spice it up by getting our second puncture! The spare inner tube did not fit the pump properly so Nick decided to patch up the existing one. We left the Avenue Vert path and headed into the town of Forges Les Eaux.<\/p>\u000a<p>We found the hotel easily enough. It was the first time we had to put on our best Del Boy french as the receptionist did not (want to) speak English. We were given keys to the garage to lock our bikes. Dawg produced the biggest, heaviest lock you could imagine. No one was going to take our velo's. I found that Michael had sneaked a teapot into my bag from Newhaven Lodge which was kind of him! We used it in order to make the Farnborough Rockets (Rego) Tea.<\/p>\u000a<p \/>\u000a<p>Farnborough Rockets Cup Of Tea<\/p>\u000a<div class=\"youtube\">\u000a    <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"360\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/0lmqxzBXv-M\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe>\u000a<\/div>\u000a<p \/>\u000a<p>The room was functional, but in order to squeeze three of us in they'd put in a childs camp bed in. Who was going to get the bum deal here? Nick was quite worried about the lack of puncture strategy kit, so wandered around the seemingly dead town at 8pm looking for bike shops. We gave up on that idea and decided to eat some French food for the first time in a Chinese!<\/p>\u000a<p>The meal was excellent, although I was well behind on the drinking front. We still had not decided which of us would be unlucky enough to sleep in the small bed. We had a coin toss comp.

Then the rain came so we decided to stop at the top of Turners Hill at the pub for some much needed lunch.<\/p>\u000a<p>The rain persisted and the next hour or so was just getting miles under the belt.

Still as soon as the downhill came, at about 4 or 5km Daddy re-took the lead. Daddy kept it strong, passing Farfar a couple of times and then saw us lot on the final bend.

The target was to beat last weeks time which they did by about a minute. 32:09 mins was there time which was fantastic. Ben certainly was panting hard around the course.<\/p><p>We headed straight off to Gravesend where Daddy went off with Ma Ma, Pop Pop and Bradley Teale to Gillingham for an adventurous Kayak trip around Hoo Ness. It's been Bradley's ambition for the past 6 years to actually go around the fort so we had good purpose to explore. First potential disaster overerted when the boot of our car slid up which pushed the kayak forward and almost on to the car parked in front. Just so happened Bradley was alert and thus saved a crash!<\/p><p>They set off towards Hoo Ness Island from Gillingham Strand at low tide which was not ideal. Bradley was a little unsure and found the choppy conditions a little unnerving at first. However he settled down and began to enjoy the scenery. There was quite a lot of rubbish which was quite noticeable as they circumnavigated the north side of the island. After half an hour or so, the intrepid sailors looked for a landing spot close to the 150 year old fort. It was difficult as the tide was out which left a lot of mud flats. Finally they found a place, however they were beached 5 metres from dry land. Daddy took his boots and socks off and pulled the vessels in. The intention was for the others not to get wet or muddy. However, once landed they were met with plenty of sinking mud. Daddy foolishly trekked off and didn't get too far before the sinking mud almost ate his boots! In an effort to help pretty much everyone fell over and lost footwear! It was pretty funny really. After a wash down and a struggle they re-boarded their craft and continued past all the scuttle ships which were a great site.<\/p><p>A bay of opportunity presented itself closer to the fort and this time they were able to land and reach ashore without too much bother. They stopped for some much needed Tomato soup which went down well as they were all beginning to feel the chill. Daddy and Bradley went off to see if they could get inside the fort which was defended well with thick foliage. Finally they did find the gangplank which went over the moat. However, it was sunken under water. At the same time they found the opening they could hear Gerry shouting for us quite loudly. What was wrong? Well luckily Carol and Gerry had stayed behind as the tide had quickly turned and came in. Gerry managed to move his Kayak up the beach and Carol was in the water holding Daddy's kayak. Thank goodness for the mother in law!<\/p><p>I think physical and mental strength was waining, that coupled with the weather drawing in meant the travellers were keen to get back to the mainland and get cleaned! The water was quite choppy with waves splashing on to the boats. 25 minutes of paddling ensured the safe return. It was a good adventure even if they didn't get inside Hoo Ness or the intended Darnet fort. Maybe another day.<\/p><p>Meanwhile the girls along with Benny stayed for lunch at the Teales and then went to Shorne Country Park. They went for a long walk to the mausoleum, a bit longer than expected which didn't thrill the kiddies, especially as it was raining.

Would he last 2 laps? What sort of time would he get? We met up with James and Duncan and we told Ben about the 10 run t-shirt. However, he'd have to complete 2 laps to register for this. This I think spurred him on. Daddy, Ben and James all ran together and it was difficult to gauge as Ben seemed like he could go faster whenever he wanted and didn't sweat at all despite wearing his hoody! Anyway his trainers fell off twice, once near the finish line, he completed the course in 33:06 minutes and came 281 out of 309 runners. We were very proud and made Daddy's day.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_04_06-03-Parkrun.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Ben's First Parkrun' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Ben's First Parkrun<\/p><p>Finally we had some blue skies, sun and no wind. Time for a walk then. We choose the Greenwich walk which starts at the O2, somewhere we've not been before. We parked up in Charlton and caught the bus in. We were impressed and excited at being at the O2. Mummy felt guilty that we've never taken us to see a concert or anything here. One day maybe. We circled the building and even saw people climb some stairs to the top! Wicked. Anyway we got to the Thames and headed west on our slightly weird journey into Greenwich. We walked by heavy plant places, along the Blackwall Tunnel road and along some of the quainter, quieter streets. We stopped for a picnic outside the Cutty Sark pub which was much need by Jessica, before finally hitting the University Buildings. We wet inside our favourite Painted Hall. There are mirrors mounted on top of tea trolleys so you can marvel at the paintings on the ceiling. However, Jessica was marvelling at herself more I think and being silly.<\/p><p>After the chapel we entered the park and played on the swings. There were some more apparatus there now. It was a lovely sunny afternoon. We climbed the hills, and roly pollied down some of them on our way to top and the observatory. There were loads of tourists there. What will it be like in the summer? We wound our way back dow n into town and Daddy had spotted his favourite Pie And Mash shop had reformed and relocated. This made his day. Goddards had ceased to exist in the past few years, the premises taken over by Gourmet Burger (yuk, Judas, errr), but happily they sprung up again on the other side of the shopping bit. We just had to go in and get some pies and a sausage roll. Thank goodness they were as good as ever. We then went in to the big sweet shop and fleeced mummy for some sweets before fighting our way through the market and over to the Cutty Sark. The first time we've seen it since it was restored. It had a strange glass bit around the bottom. When we peered through, there was an underground bit which meant you could effectively walk under the boat.<\/p><p>At the other end of the boat was a street performer singing blues music and playing a harmonica and a steel, electric, slide guitar. This made Daddy's day now three times over. He was compelled to buy the chaps CD, which we all had to endure on the way home. Actually Ben said he liked it! Anyway back to proceedings. We had our race down the foot tunnel. Daddy, Katie and Ben ran down the steps quicker than Mummy and Jessica could go down in the lift. Once up the other side we got the DLR to Royal Victoria Dock. To end our planes, trains and automobiles trek we caught a 'flight' across the Thames in the cable car which took us back to the O2. We loved it, although we were little embarrassed when Ben was saying he should take a bomb into our carriage! A fine 5 mile afternoon.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_04_06-17-GreenwichWalk.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Roly Pollies Down Greenwich Park' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Roly Pollies Down Greenwich Park<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_04_06-24-GreenwichWalk.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The Gang In London' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The Gang In London<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_04_06-53-GreenwichWalk.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Flight Across Thames' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Flight Across Thames<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Walk 43: Greenwich and Sky Ride, Ben Parkrun"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":1,"m":4,"y":2013},"datev":20130401,"images":2,"info":{"content":"<p>We joined Uncle Richard, Evie and Joshua for a cold, windy walk around the second of our National Trust Easter Egg hunts of the long weekend.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_04_01-12-HatchlandsPark.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Hatchlands Park (NT)' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Hatchlands Park (NT)<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_04_01-33-HatchlandsPark.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='All Made Up' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>All Made Up<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Hatchlands Park Easter Egg Trail"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":31,"m":3,"y":2013},"datev":20130331,"images":1,"info":{"content":"<p>In the morning mummy was mad and went to the 6am church service held on top of Frimley Green hill!

Mummy and Katie came out as a search party worried Daddy had a diabetic coma! I ask ya. Anyway all was well and snuggled in and watched Harry Potter in the evening.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_01_20-06-WoodsSledging.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Sledging siblings' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Sledging siblings<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"More Sledging - Woods"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":19,"m":1,"y":2013},"datev":20130119,"first":{"name":"benjamin","value":"Jump off 5m diving board"},"images":1,"info":{"content":"<p>In the morning we went out to play in the snow. We took the sledges to the local fields and played on the smallest slopes in the world. Still we had it all to ourselves and we loved it. Daddy ended up pulling the three of us as quick as he could and made us all fall off!<\/p><p>In the afternoon we went to the Spectrum for a swim with the Elders and Ma Ma and Pop Pop. After singing happy birthday and a coffee we went into the relatively quiet pool. We had a great time on the slides and wave machine. We eventually made our way over to the diving boards to test our courage. We'd not done the 3.5m board before and although we just jumped off it, still we made it. Ben then went to the highest, 5m board. He chickened out at first, but after Daddy showed him the way, Ben did jump. With all our hearts in our mouths he surfaced unscathed. He was trembling with excitement at what he had just achieved. It made Daddy proud. It made Mummy not be there. She did not want to see it. Joey and Uncle Michael followed off the 5m platform as well. Ben had a total of 5 jumps off the top board. Katie had a look, but sense prevailed.<\/p><p>In the evening we went over to the Elders for Auntie Ellie's baby-shower. We gave her a nappy cake and played games. Katie joined in whilst the rest of us went to bed.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_01_19-15-SnowDettingen.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Jessica racing down the hill, helped on by Katie' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Jessica racing down the hill, helped on by Katie<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Snow, Spectrum Swim, Ellie Baby Shower"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":13,"m":1,"y":2013},"datev":20130113,"images":1,"info":{"content":"<p>After church, Steven, Joyce and the cute Eva came over for Sunday lunch.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_01_13-01-EvaBarnett-Jessica.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Jessica and Eva - Crafting away' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Jessica and Eva - Crafting away<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Steven, Joyce and Eva for Sunday Lunch"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":7,"m":1,"y":2013},"datev":20130107,"first":{"name":"jessica","value":"Jessica First Rainbows Meet"},"info":{"content":"<p>Jessica has been on the Rainbows waiting list since the age of 2 and now she has started to go.

It was an hour of almost non-stop jogging, squat trusts, burpees, mountain climbs, etc. Both survived with aching muscles.<\/p><p>In the afternoon we drew lots on where we were to go.

It was packed there, everyone had the same idea I think. The children were almost trying to get as muddy as possible!<\/p><p>When it came to leaving Daddy attempted the reverse the new car out of the mud so the rest of us could get in more easily. However, it was so muddy the wheels were spinning. In an attempt to get some traction, Daddy went forward and back at an angle. Mud was spraying everywhere. All Daddy could see was Mummy going absolutely beserk and almost having a nervous breakdown. Daddy had manoeuvred the  car into a hollow, some would say shallow ditch and the front bumper was embedded into the grass verge \/ bank. Daddy didn't know this and wondered why the car would no longer go forward. By this stage Mummy I think let the whole car park at Daddy's shortcomings. Daddy was stuck and had even taken off his boots which now sat 5 meters away from the car in an effort to keep everything clean inside.<\/p><p>Stunned, Daddy just sat in the car for about a minute not knowing what to do. A man came across an offered to help get it out. First Daddy had to step out into the mud to get his boots back on, and then address the helpful man. Eventually 6 or 7 blokes came to help, I think in sympathy for Daddy's ear-bashing that he received. After a bit of pushing the car came out easily. However there was a little bit of damage on the under-carriage which cost Â£10 to fix. Mummy was still not happy for a good long while! funny story though.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2013\/2013_01_01-07-WestWalk.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Glorious Mud' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Glorious Mud<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Alice Holt Walk With West's - Car Ditched"},"version":1}],"version":1426776543}
