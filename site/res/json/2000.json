I didn't want to think I failed because I didn't prepare how I wanted to. I had a big bowl of porridge for breakfast and trotted down the paper shop to get Lau's grandpop a paper. I wanted to make sure I was properly warmed up and felt loose. We left at about 8:15 and drove to Blackheath and got there about 8:30.<\/p><p>There were lots of people, not many drove it seemed. Plenty of warming up, going to the toilet. It was one of the warmest days of the year and sunny. There was a great friendly, nervous atmosphere, with helicopters floating about. Martin and Dad rang me up just before the race to wish me good luck. Laura was there to support me. We kept shuffling forward as 9am approached. Loads of people got rid of their sweatshirts and just lobbed them to the side. I didn't even know the race had started. It wasn't until 9:15 until I crossed the start line!<\/p><p>I took it very easy to begin with, and enjoyed it. It was great with the cheering crowds. My nervous tension meant I had to go to the toilet after the first 3 miles. The pace was effortless, but slow. At 3 miles we joined with the other starters and booed at them. It was a great atmosphere. At this point you could appreciate the enormity of the volume of people.<\/p><p>The first milestone point was at the Cutty Sark (7 miles) where Laura waited for me. It must have taken me an hour to get there. There were so many people watching, I didn't see Lau. We had agreed to see each other a mile or so on, so from then on I was just looking at the crowd, but couldn't see her or my parents, who said they must have just missed me.<\/p><p>Anyway come the 8\/9 mile marker in Bermondsey, the marathon really began. The honeymoon period was over. The crowds were sparse and competitors a bit more concentrated. This is where the mental side began for me to tell myself to keep going. I just kept at my own pace. I reached Tower Bridge and I picked up with all the crowds. I felt a bit sad that I hadn't seen anyone and consigned myself not to seeing anyone as how would they know where I was?<\/p><p>Half way was reached in 2:15 minutes which I was pleased at. I thought from here onwards was the most I or any of my friends had run. We saw all the runners coming back who had done 21\/22 miles. I just could not comprehend running that fast. I quickly tired, and went to the toilet up a side street, I also stopped for a minute at 14 miles. I felt so disappointed in myself, but I felt light headed. I thought I was in need of sugar. 30 seconds late I began again. Luckily kids were handing out Jelly Babies and sweets. I grabbed them. My health improved again and I felt mentally very positive again, even though my body wasn't.<\/p><p>Many people had stopped to walk at 15 miles, so it felt good overtaking a lot of people. I kept going like this for another 5\/6 miles. I saw Laura by Marsh Wall (I think) which was really nice. I hope she was proud of me. I enjoyed this part as the scenery was different and I was proud of myself for keeping running, wondering where I got my stamina from.<\/p><p>At 20 miles I was struggling again and felt hungry. I saw mum and dad for the first time. Mum looked really proud of me. I asked for food. Eventually I got a Frusli bar (oat bar) and a banana off them. They had to run after me to give it to me, which was quite funny.<\/p><p>On exiting the Isle Of Dogs I felt I was on the last lap and all I had to do is keep going and not stop. I saw runners coming the other way, who had only done 14 miles. I felt poor sods. Although still positive in thought, my body just couldn't do much more. Nothing really hurt, just my legs couldn't do much more. I ran under Tower Bridge (22 miles), but had to start walking where the cobbled street came. I tried to start again, but really couldn't. I think I was up to about 4hrs 15mins at this point. I couldn't even walk fast! Other walkers were overtaking me! The crowds were still there.<\/p><p>At 24\/25 miles I kept coming over all emotional. Sort of crying. I don't know what that was all about. I got to parliament and the crowds were massive. I saw Susan and Graham and was able to jog again, down Birdcage Walk. This was a bit of luck as Mum and Dad were 50 yards further up with the camcorder, making it look like I'd run all the way! I turned past Bucking Palace and ran past the finish line. I felt proud and happy with myself. My official time was 5hrs 35mins, but I take the 15 minutes off to give myself 5hrs 20mins. I got my medal and someone took my chip off my shoes. I couldn't sit down, I had to make my way to the end of the Mall. Susan and Graham were by the fence. Laura was at the end, by this stage it was difficult to walk.<\/p><p>Lau and I went over to the Foreign Press Association offices between the Mall and Pall Mall. There I had some much needed food and a 20\/30 minute massage. It was nice, but I am not sure it really helped. The masseur on the next table was a fit blonde. Probably a good idea she didn't get me. Phwoaarr.<\/p><p>We struggled to Charing Cross via Piccadilly Circus. We eventually made it back to Lee, although Laura couldn't find the car! I then drove home and rested for the rest of the day.

I signed in a paid 10 quid. In return I got a number to pin onto my t-shirt. There was quite a bit of hanging around. We chatted about running and fitness.<\/p><p>It was something I could get into. There were about a 1000 entrants, about 900 more than I thought there would be. We jogged to the start. It was a coolish, windy day, but conditions weren't too bad. The gun went off and we... walked for the first 30 seconds. We broke into a trot then a run. Andrew and George's brother immediately stormed off. My tactic was to stick with George. Within the first couple of miles I could sense that my calves were tightening up.  It bothered me a bit, but continued.<\/p><p>After 3 or 4 miles, I lagged behind George but I kept in contact for the following 3 or 4 miles and eventually overtook her. There were quite a few hills, one of them over a mile long. After about 7 miles my calf was really hurting and actually made it difficult to run I could also feel my left foot split open. The final 5 or so was a real struggle. I made it to the 10 mile mark and then had to slow to a walk. I was in real agony and for a split second contemplated giving up. I battled on and thanks to encouragement from the crowd, stewards and other runners. I made it to the town centre. The encouragement really helped I stopped just after the 11 mile and 12 miles markers. My finishing time was 2 hours 19 minutes..... and I was dead.<\/p><p>I got a medal which I am very proud of and looked at the damage to my feet. Andrew laughed. My sock was blood ridden.
