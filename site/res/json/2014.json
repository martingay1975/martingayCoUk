Jessica was her usual excitable self.<\/p><p>Later in the afternoon we went around to the fars, where we had a treasure hunt around the house. We manage to get the clues and found the £15 treasure! After halfway getting through a game of Coppit, Uncle Graham arrived with Susan, so we were able to eat. We had the normal mix of pork and sausages for the evening meal.

I think it was over-excitement, but in the morning he was naughty in refusing to put on a jumper or coat on. We were in a big, cold church. He was mucking around in the church as well. He was told on numerous of occasions to behave. What? What? Was the cheeky response. \"You've got one more chance\".... \"What?\", so daddy dragged him over the pew so he could sit next to him. He got upset and grumped off and stood with Uncle Howard for the church service. He did say sorry later, and was friends again.<\/p><p>Then when Joey was around for Sunday dinner, he refused to eat his broccoli, which ended up him getting unreasonable, upset, and used every pedantic trick in the book to absolve all reasoning behind eating it. Stubbornness cost him sitting at the table on his own for 90 minutes or so. Hopefully he has learnt a lesson, not so much about eating broccoli, but more that he cannot get his own way all of the time with smart alec comments. <\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_12_21-13-DontiaEthanChristening.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'><\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Ethan's Christening, Joey - Katie Swap, Sanders and Elders over"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":20,"m":12,"y":2014},"datev":20141220,"first":{"value":null},"images":2,"info":{"content":"<p>Daddy collected Ben from Theo's sleepover at his house and went to Woodley parkrun, the 18th different UK parkrun for Ben.

I cautiously went up the pit lane, a left turn and onto the track. I gave it a bit of welly and even did a few handbrake tests when I went around the corner. I still felt pretty calm. Engines off, I heard the announcer call my name. Gaz was a couple of rows ahead of me. It felt such a long time for the control car to slowly pull away. All engines revving to the max. Angry drivers ready to do battle. We slowly crept around, the marshals were waving us frantically to keep close to each other, down the back straight the cars in front, started to really rev and we were off. The first corner successfully negotiated with a slight nudge here and there. Back to start finish straight and now going full speed. I saw Gaz spun out and almost hit the control car! I was still going around the outside. Woooo the speed. There was a lot of jostling and this is when I knew I was in a banger race. The 'jostling' was quite a shock and thought bloody hell. Anyway I went quicker than I thought I would. I really went for it down the next straight and overtook a few cars that were on the inside. It was snooze and lose. However, I should have eased up as I went too wide on the corner however still survived. Lap 2, and I got smashed from behind which took me hurtling towards the corner wall. I slammed on the brakes, but alas, SMASH. The wall! I got smacked again whilst stationary. My car was stationary. This was not going to be fun as I was in a precarious position at the end of the straight with my drivers door exposed to the oncoming cars. In front of me there was a pile up where a car end up on two wheels! I just had to sit there for the rest of the race as my car had no power. I couldn't start the slop-mobil.

The reason I couldn't restart was the power cable had been disconnected. If I had known I could have simply re-attached and gone again. It was nice to speak to friends. They said I didn't look out of place for the little time I was out on track.<\/p><p>RACE 2:<\/p><p>Patched up and out again. Same tactics. Thought if I could survive a few laps I might do alright, and how right I was. The race settled down and I followed Gaz around for a number of laps. I could have taken him out, but wanted to make sure I didn't wreck his car. Wanted him to able to get in a full race. We duelled I eventually finished ahead of him and slowed for the chequered flag. However, that was for the winners, we were at least a lap behind, but I had slowed for the end of the race. Gaz launched himself into me down the back straight. Wallop. Brilliant. We both finished the race, although my result hadn't gone through officially.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_31-05-AldershotBanger-Race2.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Gaz has got me' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Gaz has got me<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_31-06-AldershotBanger-Race2.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Gaz leaves me!' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Gaz leaves me!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_31-11-AldershotBanger-Race2.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Switch on the 'game face'' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Switch on the 'game face'<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_31-17-AldershotBanger-Race2.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Gaz following me around' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Gaz following me around<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_31-76-AldershotBanger-Race2.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Gazza's two footed challenge into my door.' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Gazza's two footed challenge into my door.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_31-62-AldershotBanger-Race2.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Screaching tyres' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Screaching tyres<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_31-59-AldershotBanger-Race2.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The dynamic duo, racing for position' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The dynamic duo, racing for position<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_31-51-AldershotBanger-Race2.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='A gent following a car wrecker!' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>A gent following a car wrecker!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_31-40-AldershotBanger-Race2.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Oh yeah baby.

There was quite a number of races until we had our third and final race: Nudge and Spin. Which sounds gentle enough doesn't it? But what it basically means is you have to hit someone in order to pass them, no hit, no pass! A dumbed down version of a DD! Out we go again and I was still bouncing around as if my wheels were oval shaped and rubbed up against the wheel arch. I tried to push start Gaz, but unfortunately his car was not having any of it, and so had to retire before the race had even started. This time I lined up on the grid near the back. A good place to be. The control car peels off and almost instantly I get a heavy whack from behind on the home straight! Loved it. The next few laps were bumpy, I nudge one or two out of the way, then about Lap 5 there was a car ahead going half the speed of me, so wallop I give him the biggest hit I could muster square on the back side! Love it. It felt pretty strong, but I think at the same time someone was behind me, so in effect I was the meat in a sandwich! My car was wrecked, back and front. The other cars got away. Just leaving me. After the initial shock, I tried to get the slop-mobil going again. It wasn't looking good. Then a glimmer of hope, I could hear the engine turning over trying to start. It sounded as if it were drowning. The engine was overheating and steam was emanating from the bonnet. Just as the slop-mobil was going to start. SMASH. Someone hit me hard from behind and by all accounts there was no one else around they took a long run up down the straight and headed square for me! I wasn't even on the track!<\/p><div class=\"youtube\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/CGCi4EubFo4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><\/div><p>Again a little dazed. I went back to work at starting her up. Success! Woo Hoo. I thought back in the game. Then my heart sank, the car wouldn't move. I tried revving really hard both in forward and backwards gears. Steam was billowing out of the car. Katie was sobbing her eyes out. Mummy was urging me to get out of the car as she thought it was going to blow up!! 12 laps into the race, I resigned to the fact the slop-mobil was dead. Time to dice with death and get out of the car before I was targeted again. There was a gap, so unharnessed myself and ran into the middle of the track and watched the last laps with Gaz.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_31-10-AldershotBanger-Race3.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Looks like I'm gonna take him out' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Looks like I'm gonna take him out<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_31-12-AldershotBanger-Race3.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Aaarghh.

Mark Pope, the winner, said he'd never been cheered so much. There certainly was a lot of support for us. The car was fork lifted back to the pits and loaded straight on to the transporter. Thanks have to go to the pit crew. Some off which just seemed to turn up and help out. Great community. Special thanks to Russel and Paul Quinnell.

We had a great time.<\/p><p>It was the worst day weather-wise. It rained on and off. We headed to Perranuthnoe, near Penzance, dumped the car and went for a walk to St Michael's Mount, an island at high tide, but not at low tide. We took the costal path which lead us on to the beach, then a treacherous passage over rocks in the sea. This was too much, so Mummy and Jessica returned to the car and drove around. Meanwhile the rest of us climbed up a steep, high bank to re-join the path. It was quite exciting. An adventure. Not quite mirroring the Famous Five mummy had been reading the car, but nevertheless, we were not sure if it was possible or if it lead to a path to the St Michael's Mount. Fortunately it did.<\/p><p>We had a good time playing about on the rocks and view the impressive island. Then the heavens decided to open once more, very heavily. We took cover, returned back to shore.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_01-31-Day5-StMichaelsMount.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Bad Girls' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Bad Girls<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_08_01-37-Day5-StMichaelsMount.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Tip toeing over the cobbles at St Michael's Mount' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Tip toeing over the cobbles at St Michael's Mount<\/p><p>Daddy then decided to go off piste, and we headed towards Lands End.

Some took an effort, and of course the others wanted to follow. We had fun.<\/p><p>Katie decided now was the time to get rid of the cast around her arm. It was a soft cast that the doctor said we could cut when we saw fit. At first, Katie said she preferred the cast on and felt weird when it was off.<\/p><p>We left Cardinham Woods and headed off to Newquay and hit the beach. Daddy was called a smurf-ette because he refused to go into the sea as there was no dry towel for him. Ahhhhhh. Poor Daddy. The rest of us didn't let that bother us and jump straight in..... when we walked the 500m to the sea. Tide was out.<\/p><p>The Big Build project was underway.

Literally at the top, and walked down into a lovely Cornish town. The sun was out, we were treated to ice creams and we hit the beach and played boul, catch and bat and ball. It was a lovely atmosphere. A place we all loved. We ate in town before returning up the steep hills to the car. We spent a lot more time here than we expected just because we loved it.<\/p><p>It was getting dark and late so headed this time to a Premier Inn. Our first ever. As a visitor to many Travelodge's we noticed a slight upgrade in quality.

A picturesque hill down to the lake and a path which runs to a hidden waterfall which we all had a play in. Katie wanted to protect her arm from the water so put a shopping bag around her arm. Must have looked a little strange to passers by. Anyway the waterfall was great as we could hide behind the tumbling water. Behind that were some unlit caves which were a bit eerie to walk around.

Muscles still ached but we were all fit to go again.<\/li><li>Run, Eat and Repeat - They had completed 2 laps more than us, but the wheels had come off. Jen, Phil and Alex were crocked, Tom was exhausted having no sleep, Mark had already ran 40km and the bionic man of David Peddle never knew when he was beat! 20 minutes before his leg, he was cramping badly. How he managed 50km was anyone's guess. They still managed 25 laps in total<\/li><li>Lap 4 - Everything went to plan. The whole team came to greet Sarah in after her 3rd lap, an exchange of banter, and as a team we were all off again, this time at walking pace..... and carrying a clanging money bucket. James' inspired thought which earned another £80 for the cause. TR24 competitors and spectators were so supportive. As we trotted (at best) around we swapped stories of near misses, worst hill, best view experiences. The final 1km was truly hair raising. The supporting crowds cheered, the 'Run Eat' team joined us as sprinted up the last hill which didn't seem so bad after all. We linked arms and crossed the finish line, lap 25, as one. A very fitting and emotional finish.<\/li><li>Medals and Photos - .... and more photos. We collected our well deserved medals and posed for photos. James wanted every combination possible.... and of course the jump shot!<\/li><li>Exhausted and Elated - We packed up, said our goodbyes, swapped details with our new TR24 friends, struggled home then went our separate ways.

There were the brave solo runners, fancy dress runners, casual runners, serious running clubs and charity runners. The excitement and atmosphere were building.<\/li><li>And They're Off... - Captain Duncan was our lead off man. We rushed back to base, about 2km into the circuit. We all cheered loudly and gave high fives as he ran past. 56 minutes later the snap band got passed to Richard to start leg 2. We all waited anxiously for the course report. It was tough, bloody tough: Hills, ruts, tree stumps, single paths and possibly the worst thing was the 28 degree heat!

Not only that, we had a couple of showers to add to the mix. Nervous laughter echoed around camp FF. Many of the team were running in the dark for the first time. The head torches; a new toy.

This time Crane Park, Hounslow. A small-ish parkrun. We were first to arrive. Ben started off at a quick pace. Really thought we were on for a PB. However, we misjudged the run a bit. The course was one and a half laps, instead of a normal two. So when we rounded a corner by the finish line we had enough in the tank for another kilometre. Still it was Ben's second best time ever. We were both very happy with this.<\/p><p>They returned home and Daddy's next task was to get ready for a bit of Daddy and daughter time. They both wanted to do a bit of kayaking. The River Abbey was a perfect choice. A circular route, yes even on a river, it had plenty of interesting things to see and challenges to tackle.<\/p><p>They started at Chertsey Bridge and Daddy couldn't quite remember where the entrance to the River Abbey was so they went up and down the Thames a bit passing the same heron three times. It was near the weir which was a bit scary to pass as the waves pushed us into a moored boat. It was a bit dicey for a few seconds, but they powered themselves through and it quickly became all serene. The next task was the tackle the slope by Abbey Chase house. We got out and hauled the kayak up the rollers. We now were officially on the Abbey River. Probably the only craft that's been from end to end for months. The river was banked by lots of vegetation, a lot of it overgrown. Many lilies and bamboo type plants. There were a number of blockages on the route which they had to negotiate. Then there were the low bridges which they had to duck under and the fallen trees. Some were just about passable, one they had to climb onto, use their feet to move the kayak under and then get back in again. All good fun and made it different to a normal boating excursion.<\/p><p>It was a really nice trip. They saw so many nice things together. Their bottoms were getting sore once they had retuned back onto the Thames at Penton Hook, so they stopped off at Laleham for a spot of food and drink. They returned via Chertsey Lock to Chertsey bridge, the car, then home.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_05_17-03-AbbeyRiverKayak.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Alone' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Alone<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_05_17-04-AbbeyRiverKayak.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Tree Down' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Tree Down<\/p><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/z0Ie4Qszf38\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"><\/iframe><p>In the afternoon Jessica went to a birthday party in the Methodist church, whilst Mummy and Ben went to the cubs AGM at the cub hut.<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Crane Park PR, Abbey River Kayak.

This was planned to be the final stretch: Greenhithe to Gravesend. The last time Daddy was at Greenhithe Daddy was soaked have rolled the kayak at the QE2 bridge! Could today fair better?<\/p><p>The boys started from the causeway by the Pier Hotel. The weather was overcast and windy. They set off in Pop Pop's kayak and it soon became apparent that the wind was going to play a major part in proceedings. Along with the high tide there was no problem in moving towards the Gravesend direction, more the fact the wind was pushing them into the middle of the river. The boys had to work hard to keep out of the middle especially as there was an oil tanker being pushed by 2 or 3 tug boats. Fortunately they were a way off that. Pop Pop said that when there are 'white horses' on the tops of the waves then it is at least a force 5, which 30 to 35mph winds in English money.<\/p><p>The waves were hitting the boat which was fun at first, but they were taking on water. Some big waves hit them and the craft became more unstable. The boys were paddling almost solely on one side just to keep them from drifting in to the centre. Suddenly another wave crashed in and the boys had to break from paddling just to concentrate on balancing the vessel. A second wave hit them and they almost rolled.<\/p><p>It was at this point the boys, like politicians, very diplomatically suggested that they should moor up by the bank. They had only been going for 20 minutes or so and had almost reached the peninsula at Greenhithe. They paddled hard to the bank and were suprised to see how much water they had taken on board.<\/p><p>Both agreed that it was too dangerous to continue, it would only be a matter of time before they would have rolled the kayak.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_05_11-01-GreenhitheKayaking.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Picture paints a 1000 words' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Picture paints a 1000 words<\/p><p>Where were they? Well a disused cement works, seemingly miles from anywhere. No life around. The boys split up and headed in opposite directions to find how they could get out of this mess.

Chillworth and its mills and hills. There were streams to paddle, bridges to balance across, derelict building to explore, pill boxes, steep, high banks to climb, style to cross and lovely hill top scenary to appreciate. This followed the normal format of initial resistance, followed by begrudging acceptance of having a good time, then tiredness near the end. Ben and Jessica especially played so nicely together. They were playing Army for most of it. General Ben and Captain Jess both gunning there way across the paths.

Ben was so desperate to win it, as he wanted the prize money to fund buying Minecraft on the PC. So his idea was a New York themed meal. Bagels for starters, Cheeseburger and Fries for main and a New York Taxi inspired lemon drizzle with a sponge Empire State building. He was very good in the kitchen for a boy who has not shown a lot of interest in cooking before. He shoved Daddy aside when there were tasks he could do. Bagels is something no one had made before. Wierd that you had to dunk in the bread dough into simmering water for a minute. They went down a storm, if a little big. The cheeseburger was hand made from the mince which was nice, but the boys forgot one of the main components of a burger, the buns! Doh. Never mind, the pudding was an interesting combo of a lemon drizzle cake with a slab of yellow dyed icing shaped and carved into a New York taxi. The thought was there. The Empire State building sponge cake, was not handled with particular care in the preparation stage, so end up more like the World Trade Centre towers! Never mind, the boys has spent 3 or 4 hours in preparing for the meal which was reflected in the marks given.<\/p><p>So as the final host, Ben added the scores and anounced that Daddy came 5th, then Mummy, Katie and Jessica all came joint second, leaving Ben as the winner by a single point. He celebrated and shouted winner. It was only 10 minutes later when discussing who gave what marks, that Jessica had given a 6 out of 10, not the nine that Ben had read! Jessica was seeking revenge as she had not forgotten that Ben gave her 1 out of 10 last year! So really Ben came 4th and there was a three way joint winners. However, everyone had accepted Ben as the winner of the prize and got on with it which was nice.<\/p><p>There was a break in the middle of the afternoon. Daddy had treated Farmor et el to a Frenchies, the new Ice Cream Parlour in Camberley, themed like a 1950's American Diner. It was nice that Auntie Susan also came along. Ben had the Blue Moon ice cream, whilst Katie and Jessica had a raspberry and lemon cone with bubblegum balls and marshmellows.

After a month in the house we receive a letter from the SRA to say that Ashworth Law, the firm who dealt with our house transaction, had been stopped from trading due to dishonesty claims. We thought we'd be OK because our sale went through a month previously and surely the contracts would have not been exchanged or completed. WRONG! It would appear that the money obtained from our house and the mortgage was used to buy the new house, no problem, however the solicitors failed to get around to paying off 42 Swordsmans Road. As a result, the new occupiers could not register with the Land Registry as our mortgage was still unpaid. Furthermore, the Stamp Duty of £8250 had not been paid off via the Inland Revenue. So not only did the money not get paid, but the contracts were never completed it would appear on the day! What a joke of a conveyancey system this country has. So we have been left with paying off two mortgages, been fined a £100 for late Stamp Duty payment and lobbing out £175 per hour for a new set of solicitors to complete the sale and purchase of the respective houses we own!<\/p><p>An intervening agent is assigned who acts similar to an administrator. They are the ones who freeze the accounts. Nothing comes in or out. They said it will be at least up till the late summer before any sort of resolution can be expected. Even then nothing is guaranteed. In the meanwhile we have filed for compensation via the SRA. In total we are currently £87,000 down.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2014\\2014_01_11-01-AshworthLawShutDown.JPG' class='diaryImage' alt='Ashworth Law Article' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Ashworth Law Article<\/p><\/woops>","images":false},"title":{"value":"£87,000 down after Solicitor is stopped by SRA for dishonesty"},"version":4},{"date":{"d":4,"m":1,"y":2014},"datev":20140104,"first":{"value":null},"images":2,"info":{"content":"<p>Daddy was pleasantly surprised to hear that he'd done well at work and was given a £100 to spend on a meal for the family as a reward!
