Auntie Grace to me had always been such a funny, kind lady for whom I'll take away so many fond memories. We used to visit her down in Deal at least once a year. Susan and I would find it boring all the talking she did with dad about family history and what not. Stuff I'd absolutely loved to hear about now. Times in the war. Sadly too young too appreciate. Anyway, Susan and I used to play hockey and golf with the Dixon's walking sticks. Another memory was the outside toilet. The only house I remember with an outside loo.<\/p><p>I can remember the smallest kitchen in the world, the shaking hands when pouring the tea (something Susan suffers with now) and the 'Do you want anymore duck?'. The Dixon's had a chair lift up and down the stairs in their later years which for kids like us provided more entertainment. Those stairs were quite steep though I seem to remember. Grace was a little lady, with a smiley face, white hair and had a great character. First time she saw mum, the first thing she said to her was 'Do you want a bath duck?'. She held quite some knowledge of the family tree. I remember once watching a cine film from the 1930's with Grace and Norman. The event of watching it with them was really funny. Plumes of dust billowed from the projector, Norman not hearing Grace's command to stop and the noise that the projector made was really loud. This is more Norman, but years back we went for a drive with Norman, and he drove so slowly that there was a queue irrate traffic behind him. He continued unflapped and seemingly oblivious to the modern need to rush about. Grace and Norman, I miss you so much. With the inheritance money passed, I bought a picture of two Hurricane's flying over your native London to remind me of you. It has hung above the fireplaces in both our homes for the past 10 years.<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Auntie Grace Dies"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":24,"m":12,"y":1997},"datev":19971224,"info":{"content":"<p>Laura came over for a traditional Danish Christmas meal.<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Xmas Eve Meal"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":23,"m":12,"y":1997},"datev":19971223,"info":{"content":"<p>Went to the Dominion Theatre with Laura.<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Theatre - Beauty And The Beast"},"version":1},{"date":{"d":21,"m":12,"y":1997},"datev":19971221,"images":1,"info":{"content":"<p>Tore ligaments in my left knee I think.

The dissertation analyzed the software developer, Michael Jackson's, new way of describing Software Requirements in a structured method. My dissertation has consumed my life for a year or more. I can only describe it to be similar to a best man's speech, where no matter how hard you work at it, it sometimes doesn't come out as intended. It's something that eats at you every spare moment you have. Given the extra pressure of it determining the grade you get and therefore how you are set for the job market, the amount of money you can command, etc. etc.<\/p><p>My vow at the start of the academic year was twofold. One - was to understand everything being taught to me at the time it was taught. This way I would relieve myself of pressure at the end of the year when exams came around. Every other previous academic year I've ever been through, relied on me learning stuff in revision. Revision should be for topping up and refreshing arguments to put into answers, not to try and understand something taught 6 months previous, or for you to rote learn stuff.<\/p><p>Two - Was to work hard at the dissertation early on and not to leave it to the last minute. Unfortunately, I done both. Worked extremely hard at it and left it to the last minute. I remember in the last month or two, just working 12+ hours a day in front of the computer, pruning, adding, adjusting, researching, reading. I think it came to about the week before where I had all the content, but absolutely no structure, or putting my point across to the reader. I panicked severely. I think I was taken to the edge. I remember crying on the phone to Laura one evening whilst she was back in Gravesend, and she drove down (with Charlotte who she was babysitting so to speak) all the way to Bournemouth just for a few hours. I needed her so badly then. I don't think I've needed someone there for me so badly. She was a godsend at the time.<\/p><p>I remember I also poured out to dad my dissertation woes. I went home and he tried to help me sort it out. He even arranged to go and meet his friend from the railway. Although they did not really help directly, I realised I was making things so much more complicated than they were or needed to be. I decided to make it an introduction into Michael Jackson's ideas. My first step was to impose a structure almost a contents page, writing the conclusion first, and leading the reader to that conclusion. I continued by putting a bit more detail into the headings, stating what each paragraph was attempting to relay to the reader.<\/p><ul><li>It taught me a great lesson in methodically going through a relatively complicated topic.<\/li><li>It taught me that without an initial goal, a project can have no direction.
