Here are the reasons<\/p><woops woopstitle=\"Spill Yellow Paint Over The Car\" rating=\"7\"><p>I managed to spill yellow paint in the back seat, when I borrowed a whole pot of paint without realizing the lid wasn't securely on. I went around a roundabout and hadn't realize it had tipped onto its side. There was so much 'double yellow line' paint over the back seat and floor. I remember when I opened the door, it started flowing out onto the road. I didn't even attempt to clean it up, because I knew it was going to be no good. It eventually dried to a very thick crust. It was legendary.<\/p><img src='images\/years\/2002\/2002_01_19-02-PoppyDaisy.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Back seat - nice shade of yellow' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Back seat - nice shade of yellow<\/p><\/woops><woops woopstitle=\"Car got 'stingered'. Cost more to get back than its worth\" rating=\"8\"><p>Someone decided to steal my car! It wasn't difficult to pick the lock, as all you needed to do is put any key in the driver’s side door and hey presto! This was a useful feature for me, allowing me to seemingly lock myself out of the car. The thief managed to break this 'feature' when he broke in, as ever since then the lock worked as it was intentionally designed. A crying shame.<\/p><p>Anyway Poppy was taken by a drunk, without a license, from the Old Dean estate. Luckily a neighbour had seen it been taken, after the thief decided to bump into the cars trying to get out of the parking space. The Police finally stopped the car, by setting a 'stinger' trap by the Ferrari garage in Egham. However, the Police impounded the car at a garage so they could get forensic evidence. I wonder what they thought of the paint. So it cost me a heap of money in storage costs and 4 new tyres. I never got compensated for this. It cost me more to put the car back on the road, than the car was actually worth.<\/p><\/woops><woops woopstitle=\"Car roll down the hill into another car whilst I was asleep\" rating=\"8\"><p>The handbrake was wearing a bit thin.... and I park the car on a hill.... which at the bottom of is the very busy and fast A30. I think you can almost guess what's coming next. Anyway one day I go to my car in the morning to go to work, when this neighbour (by coincidence the one who rang the police when my car got stolen) came out to confront me. My car had rolled down the hill into this neighbours car. Luckily there was no damage, and luckily it was there in order to stop it from going onto the A30. The thing was that this women couldn't go to work, because if she moved her car, mine would roll down the hill.<\/p><\/woops><p>When I took the car to the scrappy I managed to get 60mph in 2nd gear, which I thought was quite an achievement.
