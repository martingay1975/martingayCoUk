Daddy was a little dismissive of it. He knows eating sugars are bad and should be equalized with an insulin intake. So he was a little sceptical on how useful the course would be.<\/p><p>Retrospectively speaking, the course surpassed expectations and he was really glad he went on it. So much so, Daddy really could have done with this course much earlier. What it taught him over the 3 days, was it's not sugar so much, but carbohydrates as a whole. So the porridge Daddy eats each morning requires more insulin to be taken than a doughnut for instance. During the week they calculated that for every 8 grams of carbs taken, 1 unit of Humalog is required. Also a correction dosage of 1 unit for every 2mmol. Also probably the 20 units of Lanctus was a few too many. It's now reduced to 18. The other thing learnt was carb counting. So estimating the carb content in a plate of food. This estimating process is now a lot better. Finally at the end of the course a new gluscose monitoring machine was handed out. Daddy now enters the number of carbs taken, and the machine calculates the insulin dosage. Since the course (and even during the course), Daddy's control has got a lot better. The number of really high readings has greatly reduced.<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Diabetes Course"},"version":4},{"date":{"d":13,"m":11,"y":2016},"datev":20161113,"first":{"value":null},"images":3,"info":{"content":"<p>Daddy went up to the O2 with Howard on the train and met with Ma Ma in Garfunkels inside.

They managed to clock in just under the hour which is very impressive. The others meanwhile continued through and climbed Coll de Soller. A hard climb, where Daddy yet again almost came off his bike when he was distracted rounding a tight hairpin. It was tough going. The descent on the other side was not much to write home about. The road surface was poor and length of straights short. There was a beautiful stretch of tarmac however leading into the town of Bunyola. Bob stopped off for his prized map which he had been after for the whole trip. They also got chatting to this English girl who overtook them on the Coll de Soller. She was cycling on her own, I guess no one could keep up with her. The initial climb out of Bunyola was nice, with terraced houses clinging on to the rock face. The next challenge was to attempt to get to Orient before Michael and Robin caught the three remaining boys up. In the way was the Col de Honor. A tricky little devil but had little traffic. The last hill climb of the holiday, so Daddy put all his effort into it. Another sweat on, another attempt on trying to keep Bob in Daddy's sights. 30 minutes later and the bus passed just before the summit. The road surface was pretty poor on the way down, but Daddy and Bob made it to Orient. Far beyond what they thought they could achieve today.

However, after a large breakfast, the boys were almost ready to go. Daddy had another overnight puncture. This broke the breach and they looked into why he had 3 punctures within a day. Too many for a coincidence and the boys found that a previous spoke repair had been carried out without taping the wheel properly again! Thank goodness resourceful Bob had some tape with him.... and off they went - initially with a slight drizzle of rain.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-301-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='On our way together' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>On our way together<\/p><p>A few miles down the road, rain jackets off and a stop off at a nice little coffee \/ juice bar where Michael and Robin had man-sized coffees. This bar, Sa Ruta Verde, was much loved. Perhaps because it had nice drinks, merchandise and a owner who was very sociable. A challenge was set for the foxes to catch the hares up the mountain to the petrol station. Bob sneaked in first (hare), followed by Nick (hare) and Daddy (hare) then shortly after Michael (fox), Robin (fox) and Dave (hare). They stopped for 'petrol' and veered off yesterday's route down past Lluc on a short downhill stretch.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-310-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Robin and Michael enjoying big drinks for a big ride' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Robin and Michael enjoying big drinks for a big ride<\/p><p>The group split and came back together a few times as they skirted around Puig Tomir and then down some more big hills. The cars were a bit of an obstacle.... well not to Michael, he sped past most of them. Then once on the flat into and past Pollença the Rockets looked like a pro outfit. The six were drafting and making superb progress. Probably Daddy's favourite bit just because they were altogether working as a team and speeding along at a great rate. Fantastico.<\/p><p>An early lunch in Port de Pollença. Michael happened to drop his guts in the town centre which a couple of tourists heard. Daddy and Nick made the most of it and egged on the tourists to laugh at him and make smelly hand waving actions. All were holding their noses. I think Michael was a touch embarrassed, and so he should. :)<\/p><p>After many miles of easy riding, the boys were still on the way out and now the tricky Formentor peninsula had to be tackled - 12 miles of it. First a 800 foot climb to Mirador Es Colomer where there were many tourist marveling at the north coast view and an obelisk. The boys moved on attempting to tick off a mental barrier, the half way point. Many ups and downs, a tunnel and a lady wanting her picture taken by Michael were all on the route.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-331-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The tunnel on the way to Formentor' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The tunnel on the way to Formentor<\/p><p>Finally, they rounded the final bend and the lighthouse was waiting and drawing the Rockets in. There were cars queueing for quite a way. Daddy smugly overtook them and reached the rest of the group. Time for looking about. Couldn't get too close to the lighthouse. The views were pretty good. Robin was bushed and I've seen worse places to kip!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-339-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Robin making the most of the views!' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Robin making the most of the views!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-345-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Rockets at Formentor 1' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Rockets at Formentor 1<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-346-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Rockets at Formentor 2' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Rockets at Formentor 2<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-348-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The actual lighthouse' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The actual lighthouse<\/p><p>They had a few group shots, before moving off on the homeward journey. Again good initial pace was made and the journey off the peninsula seemed much quicker than the one to the lighthouse. They hugged the coast down Port de Pollença again turning right and much relief away from the traffic and other cyclists. In fact it was nice to be alone again. Daddy and Nick followed the route back whilst the others took a slightly longer route - they got lost! Daddy by now with only 10 miles to go was flagging seriously and had to stop a number of occasions. Nick was great support. Finally everyone met at the local bar, Bar Sa Tafona in Biniamar for a well earned beer.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_09-354-Majorca_Day3-Formentor.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Well deserved beer in Biniamar' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Well deserved beer in Biniamar<\/p><p>The last evening and the decision was made to go out to eat. Biniamar had nothing to offer, so whilst we were getting ready Mr King was tasked on finding a place to eat. They crammed in the bus and headed for the next town of Llosseta. Nick on navigation took them down some very narrow streets and credit to E'ster who drove superbly. The passengers just shut their eyes and prayed. They dumped the van in the town square (a bit unorthodox) and set on foot. Nick not inspiring confidence on knowing where he was going. We almost completed a lap, but stumbled across the targeted, Celler Can Carrossa Restaurante. Not many in, and looked a little too fine for the rabble of men. However, we set forward and went for the set menu. Course after course came out. I think Nick must have sweated a bit as the diners were getting increasingly concerned at the final bill. Siz courses of fine dining later, the bill came out at just 35 euros each. A bargain considering the quality. They had puffer fish, lamb, sorbet, and many other dishes. Nick got a pat on the back in the end. An end to great day. Packed a lot in.<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"Majorca Biking Day 3 - Formentor"},"version":18},{"date":{"d":8,"m":10,"y":2016},"datev":20161008,"first":{"value":null},"images":10,"info":{"content":"<ul><li>Distance: 79 km<\/li><li>Climbs: 3,108 metres<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/741279810\" target=\"_blank\">Day 2 Route\u000a               \u000a        \u000a            <img class=\"image-icon\" src=\"\/Scripts\/components\/navigation\/images\/strava.png\" \/><\/a><\/li><\/ul><p>The first big day and the iconic Sa Calobra with it's twisting, switch back roads.

Robin and Michael shot off as they were so much quicker than the remaining four. That was pretty much the last time they were seen! The rocky limestone mountains created a complex and striking landscape, dotted with fig and olive trees that cling to the mountain side. It’s no wonder the mountain range has been awarded UNESCO World Heritage status. The four reached the peak and the petrol station landmark at the top. A hub for all cyclist, road and off road. Don't think any cars actually filled up with petrol. Some of the views on the ascent were breath taking. Also the first experience of the switch backs. When you see switch back roads you know you've hit the serious stuff.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_08-210-Majorca_Day2-SaColabra.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='On the way up to the top of Coll de sa Batalla' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>On the way up to the top of Coll de sa Batalla<\/p><p>Two hours in and only 16 miles covered, but 1500m climbed.

Bob and Dave raced down, whilst Daddy and Nick stopped here and there for a few photos. Wow what a decent - speeds close to 40mph. Near the bottom of the mountain Daddy got a puncture, luckily it wasn't when he was going fast - the first ever on a road bike. As they were fixing it, Michael and Robin went past on the way back up Sa Calobra. They were doing a huge 70 mile lap!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_08-222-Majorca_Day2-SaColabra.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Top of Sa Calobra' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Top of Sa Calobra<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_08-225-Majorca_Day2-SaColabra.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Daddy and Nick laughing at Sa Calobra' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Daddy and Nick laughing at Sa Calobra<\/p><p>Daddy and Nick searched for Bob and Dave, but couldn't find them.

It was an early flight, meaning Daddy left home at 2:00am to meet first with Bob. However, first issue. As Daddy had to carry quite a bit on his motorbike he clipped his cycle helmet to the bag, meaning it was flapping around at 80mph down the A331. Then fling..... the helmet was no longer attached. Daddy hadn't realized this until reaching Bob's house. So a speedy exit back onto the A331, followed by a crawl in the dark to find the missing helmet, hoping no other vehicle had damaged it. Fortunately, it was lying at the side of the road in North Camp without damage! Not a great start.<\/p><p>Dave met up and drove to Gatwick where all the crew met together. Only Daddy got stopped at security (for no reason!) and then off and away on the 5:40am flight to Palma.<\/p><p>Having arrived in warmer climes, they picked up the hire car and shot off to the villa (Cami Vell) in Biniamar, via the supermarket and bank in Inca. Daddy was having trouble getting enough cash out of the ATM to pay for the villa. Fortunately they got around the problem, and after an hour's worth of showing the villa off, Miguel left the tried, but still eager cyclists to their own devices. Unfortunately when the bikes turned up Dave's was the wrong size. Michael also wanted to spend a bit of time adjusting his bike, so only Daddy, Robin, Nick and Bob went cycling and headed 20 miles eastwards towards Port d'Alcúdia. Nick and Bob almost had a coming together when a car turned in on then.... they attempted to see the sea, but realized they were looking at Es Llac Gran, a lake!<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_07-105-Majorca_Day1-PortDePollenca.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Es Llac Gran' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Es Llac Gran<\/p><p>They crossed the road, saw some ladies play beach volleyball and moved on quickly, deciding to head north and meet up with the other two in Port de Pollença! Cycling was like a dream. Perfect weather conditions, the roads on the whole were smooth and a pleasure to ride on. One stretch however along the bay, Badia de Pollença, had a narrow, bumpy, two way cycle path, which would be very dangerous if not fully concentrating. Pedestrians and runners also shared this highway. A couple of incidents!<\/p><p>The four reached Port de Pollença and found Tolos Bar and supped on a couple of pints of strong lager.... the strength of which is still not resolved today! It blew Bob's socks off anyway. Even Michael squeezed in a pint (and was last to finish still).<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_10_07-110-Majorca_Day1-PortDePollenca.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Tolos Bar' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Tolos Bar<\/p><p>After another trip to the supermarket the boys returned to the villa where Dave cooked up a massive, scrummy Spag Bol.

We started at home and cycled into the rec, then Henley Drive, the Hatches, then along the path on the Blackwater River all the way to North Camp. There were 15 clues to get to this stage. They were pitched just at the right level of difficulty. Ben had the classic impatient, give it me attitude and fell into the trap of, if not finding the answer straight away then give up.... then when he read half the clue, would rush off! This would cost us dearly later on!<\/p><p>After over 2 hours we eventually made it to the half way stop at the Mytchett Canal Centre where we stopped for refreshments with the Fars. Ice Creams and drinks all round. Part 2 of the treasure hunt saw us explore into the woods behind the café. This proved more challenging and more popular for some reason. We eventually ended up at bottom of Deepcut, passing some horses along the way. Here we trusted Ben a bit too much. 'After Lakeland House' take the next right, go along the road for a bit and look for a sign naming the woods'. Well Ben thought he saw the house at the corner with the mini roundabout so we turned up Bellew Road. We looked left, no evidence of the sign. We went up the big hill, some had to walk. Still nothing. We basically went the length of Bellew Road into Deepcut. We doubled back again and went to the junction with Lake Road. Daddy Re-read the clue and questioned the Lakeland House part of the clue and wanted to see for himself this house. It was not where Ben had said it was. In fact we shouldn't have gone down Bellew Road at all. Lakeland House was further towards Frimley Green. We should have turned down St Catherines Road. To atone for his earlier mistake Ben went rushing off to look for the sign. Yep you guessed it. He rushed right past it and ended up near to the Fars house. Daddy found the sign a kilometre back! We must have lost half an hour due to Ben's antics. We all had a laugh about it!

It's 9 a-side on a 1\/2 pitch, 30 minutes each way, rolling subs. We had 11 players, including one girl, Lucy. Ben has and was very excited to be playing, although gutted to miss parkrun. He was larking about with his mates for most of the warm-up. Daddy was on the strictest of instructions not to 'give advice' and just let Ben get on with it! Ben started centre midfield and surprised Daddy on how well he did. He got involved. He looked to get the ball, rather than wait to come to him, he 'skilled' people, he passed, he shielded all very good. At this age strength is a bit of a problem in terms of kicking the ball hard and getting shrugged off the ball. Mytchett were outclassed really. There was the rare attack from us. On one occasion, Ben bullied his way throw and the goalkeeper took him out. Penalty! Ben steps up and........ keeper saves it. Bad luck Ben. Ben got 'studded' at the end of the first half which made him cry. He got up though and got on with it. Eventually we were on the end of a 7-0 defeat but the team enjoyed themselves, which is the most important thing. Ben got man of the match. Daddy was linesman.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_09_10-18-MytchettFalconsVFleetMustangs.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Ben won man of the match' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Ben won man of the match<\/p><p>Meanwhile, Jessica's 9th birthday party was underway back at home.

Jessica almost got daddy into trouble when she told him loudly not to keep eating the blueberries as they were being picked.<\/p><p>We then moved onto the lakes where we went to the Aqua Park. This is an assault course floated in the middle of a lake. We got our wetsuits and spent the next hour bouncing around on the inflatables. We had a great time.

Finally four of us went down the zip slide from the end of the pier down to the beach. Katie and Ben were first to go and zipped straight down. Next was daddy and Jessica. Jessica was very hesitant and Daddy thought she wasn't going to slide down. However, after a bit of encouragement she surprised us all and flew down the zip wire.

See how long he would last before having to hand over to Ma Ma. I think it was a new record. One and a half lines! Ma Ma then delivered. Loz made his address before handing over to his two best men who were fantastic. Great speeches guys.<\/p><p>The dodgems and bouncy slide opened and the kids were set free for mayhem.

You don't get the chance of running down the centre of tower bridge all that often, so made the most of it!<\/p><p>Turning the corner and heading towards the Docklands it was nice to see the fast runners 7 miles ahead still running strong. I thought it might be de-motivational but no. I did have a look out for the likes of Phil Jelly and Ali but to no avail. That was the only point in the run I looked out for other competitors. I started to talk to an old guy who said 32 years ago he would have been 7 miles ahead of his current position. Got to give the old'uns the respect due, but I was struggling to maintain a conversation as my legs were on the turn.<\/p><p>By mile 14 I was looking forward to seeing the family and kept a look out for them as communications were a little skant. My calfs felt so tight, I was ready to give up. However, thought I had to get to the family.... and then I became a little emotional on seeing them. I felt very privileged that Ellie and Gerry had made the effort to see me, and I re-paid them by running slowly and not really saying hello when I saw them. I cuddled Laura, Jessica and Ben, then ran off again. If I could I would have cuddled everyone. Shortly after I entered the Isle Of Dogs and the 15 mile marker. I was crushed. I began to walk and run for the next 5 miles. Each time I ran after 5 minutes the pain was insufferable and I had to walk. Others with the same idea of walking were overtaking. I couldn't even walk fast. I was so dissapointed as I felt this run was not doing myself justice after all the training. It was a problem I had not encountered before.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_04_24-54a-LondonMarathon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='Tower bridge' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>Tower bridge<\/p><p>Anyway 20 miles, out of the Isle Of Dogs and again by Westferry I saw the family. This really spurred me on and the tighten of the calfs disapated. Just general fatigue kicked in. The furthest I had run in 16 years now. The face slowed still dispite my spirits lifting. At 21 miles James and Duncan almost had to break the barriers and grab me before I noticed them! I went in for a Ball man-hug.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_04_24-54b-LondonMarathon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='21 miles and the Balls' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>21 miles and the Balls<\/p><p>24 miles and the Embankment, I tried to keep going. First time I felt the end was achieveable soon. Again I saw Laura, Ben and Jessica on Birdcage walk. It sounds stupid, but it is as if I hadn't seen them for a month, such a welcome sight. Buck house and rounding the final corner, up the home straight I remembered to finish in the middle lane where Kelvin was welcoming the runners in. The final official time was 5:06.13. I came 30255 out of 39083. 14 minutes quicker than my personal best, but 25 minutes later than what I was aiming for. I was disappointed in the time to be honest. People say I done well.... but I know better. I know I should have got a quicker time, and no one can convince me otherwise. Still the finish time only equates to 25% of the enjoyment of the very well run event.<\/p><img src='images\\years\\2016\\2016_04_24-57-LondonMarathon.jpg' class='diaryImage' alt='The medal' \/><p class='diaryImageCaption'>The medal<\/p><p>7:00 min\/km <a href=\"https:\/\/www.strava.com\/activities\/556217628\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"image-icon\" src=\"\/Scripts\/components\/navigation\/images\/strava.png\" \/><\/a><\/p><p>Louise Parker came in a few minutes later. We both struggled to walk up the Mall. We collected a goody bag, but I was in no shape to look at it. I needed some food and drink. Thinking about it. I barely ate anything during the past 5 hours. I had a banana at 20 miles, an orange segment handed out by a crowd member, 4 energy gels and probably a pint of water in total. I would have consumed more at home on the sofa!<\/p><p>Laura, Ben, Jess and the Fars all met me in Horse Guards Parade and nursed me back to Charing Cross where we caught a train to Lee and drove back.<\/p><p>We got in about 6:30pm after a trip down the Fish and Chip shop!<\/p><p>Total raised for Anthony Nolan was £1002.44.<\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"London Marathon"},"version":5},{"date":{"d":23,"m":4,"y":2016},"datev":20160423,"first":{"value":null},"info":{"content":"<p>In the morning Daddy volunteered as a barcode scanner at parkrun whilst Ben and Mummy ran. <\/p>","images":false},"title":{"value":"parkrun volunteering"},"version":3},{"date":{"d":20,"m":4,"y":2016},"datev":20160420,"first":{"value":null},"images":1,"info":{"content":"<p>Number 14739.

Anyway fortunately the worst went away after a few minutes and we were able to continue. Daddy went nuts at Jessica for not wanting to wear boots.
